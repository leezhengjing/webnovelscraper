# I Became a Genius in the Magic School's Front Blink

## Chapter 182: Unreal (6)

As he gazed at the scene of a pillar of pure white light descending upon the very top of the Empire State Building in New York, the fragmented soul shard of Abelain Staverk closed its eyes.

"Failure."

He had known this would happen. His trait allowed him to absorb all magic, but he couldn't overcome the "Natural Celestial Body." Even as the boy was drawn into the world he had created, he couldn't properly resist.

"To think I would witness a fate only spoken of in legends..."

During the fifty years he had slept in fragments, the world had undergone drastic changes. A boy born with a special destiny. The child of the stars. Even girls blessed by the heavens.

The fragmented soul shard of Abelain Staverk captured the final scene of Flame and Baek Yuseol embracing and being swept away by the pillar of light. They would now return to reality and live their daily lives as usual. They would cry, laugh, sometimes get angry, and fight, but they would still spend happy days together.

"Truly beautiful, yet so tragic."

Why did the heavens intertwine their fates so? If a god exists, what could he be thinking? Unfortunately, he would never see the future they would create.

"I... will now disappear."

He felt his presence gradually fading. Considering he had tried to absorb the child of the stars, it was a cheap price to pay. From the beginning, a mere fragment of a wizard's soul was too insignificant to touch such a grand existence. Perhaps it was his fate from the moment he decided to absorb her.

Still, he was satisfied. He had witnessed "her world" with his own eyes. It was a truly great, astonishing, and beautiful world. A mysterious world called Earth, which had built a civilization surpassing Aether World with just the energy of electricity, without any mana.

"This is the homeland of the child of the stars."

Thinking that such a death might not be so bad if the last sight he saw was that beautiful world, the fragmented soul shard of Abelain Staverk closed its eyes.

Heavy eyelids. No matter how hard she tried to force them open, they wouldn't budge. She thought about it. If her eyelids didn't want to move, was there any reason to force them open? Why go against her body?

"So sleepy..."

Flame gave up trying to open her eyes and let her consciousness drift away.

"Shh, be quiet. If we get caught in the hospital, it'll be a big problem."

"You ate more than me."

"I was worried you wouldn't eat quickly enough..."

"Not a problem at all."

"Hey, I was going to eat that..."

Unable to resist the noisy chatter and the smell of pizza tickling her nose, Flame's consciousness awakened.

Suddenly!

Unable to hold back, she sat up and glared. Her muscles trembled, but such pain couldn't stop her anger.

"What are you doing?"

Flame's hollow voice spread through the room, and Angel and Anella, who were eating pizza in the middle of the hospital room, froze with wide eyes.

An awkward silence.

Angel, embarrassed to be caught eating smelly food in the hospital, hung her head and blushed, while Anella awkwardly smiled and tried to explain.

"Well, I didn't know... that you couldn't eat pizza in the hospital."

Anella had lived a life completely detached from ordinary humans. After becoming a dark mage at a young age and surviving day by day in crumbling ruins, she had no common sense about hospitals. So, when she brought pizza to Flame's hospital room as a visit, Angel had scolded her harshly...

Ironically, pizza was Angel's favorite food. Unable to resist the temptation of the pizza Anella offered, this situation unfolded.

"Good grief..."

Flame sighed deeply.

"Eat. Don't mind me. After almost dying, what's a pizza?"

"Okay..."

Anella, still cautious, brought the pizza to her mouth, but Angel, embarrassed, distanced herself from it.

Flame lay back on the bed and stared at the ceiling.

"How's your body?"

Angel asked, pulling a chair to the bedside. Flame shook her head.

"No. My whole body aches. I feel like I'm getting old."

"...You're only seventeen."

"Mentally, I'm old."

She wasn't wrong. Combining her past and present lives, her age would be quite significant.

"Nom."

While the oblivious Anella munched on pizza, Angel and Flame remained silent for a while.

"How long was I asleep?"

"About three days..."

"I see."

In that relatively short time, they had formed a team to investigate the Seventh Tower's ghost stories and experienced many incidents. They discovered that Stella Academy indeed had a hidden world, witnessed countless ghosts and legends, and ultimately fought and defeated a dark mage.

"What happened while I was asleep?"

Angel slowly began to recount the aftermath.

"Right after you and Baek Yuseol returned, the professors arrived. The mirror shattered into pieces, making a detailed investigation impossible, and Professor Chekiren disappeared, so we couldn't capture him."

"I see..."

After the incident, all the students who had been dragged into the Seventh Tower were hospitalized. The event was too significant and shocking to be quietly overlooked.

"Another dark mage attack?"
"Shaking the magic world."
"Dark mage killer, how far will Eltman Eltoin's reputation fall?"
"Can Stella Academy still be called the best magic institution?"

The dark mage attack was terrifying, but even more frightening was the media attack from fellow wizards. Recently, due to repeated dark mage attacks on Stella Academy, there were efforts to tarnish its reputation.

This development was exactly like the original novel. Stella Academy's weaknesses were exposed, but the protagonist resolved the incident, boosting Angel's fame. And this time would likely be the same. Angel's faint smile suggested she had been promised a huge reward.

Meanwhile, the school was swiftly responding to the media. However, Eltman Eltoin had gone into hiding, dealing with his own matters, causing various headaches.

"Well, the principal was always like that."

In the original novel, Eltman Eltoin never directly intervened in any incident. There was always an excuse. He couldn't step in because he was dealing with something "more important." Flame didn't know what Eltman was doing during this time, but the fact that he was handling something else despite the crisis of the Seventh Tower ghost story meant it was truly important.

He wasn't the type to retreat helplessly just because an incident beyond his control occurred.

"Still, no one died. Many students are suffering from aftereffects, but... Princess Hong Biyeon seems to be safe."

"That's a relief."

The fact that their original target, Hong Biyeon, was safe was a significant achievement. Although she was still unconscious, the doctors said it was just due to fatigue and that she would wake up soon.

"Won't the Adolevit royal family make a fuss? If the school closes, I have nowhere to go..."

"They'll make a fuss, but the school won't close. Stella isn't that easy."

Ultimately, Eltman Eltoin would quell this controversy as well. He would announce the newly developed magic circle system and new technologies and declare his intention to personally hunt down dark mages. Stella Academy would become even more fortified, becoming the safest fortress in the world...

"But it won't be that easy."

Dark mage terrorism would continue. Not just at Stella Academy. They would infiltrate the magic world, slowly turning it black.

"Anyway, you did well. But you overdid it at the end. It's a relief you're safe, but..."

"Oh, that."

At the last moment, Flame had charged at the full-length mirror, but it was a trap.

"Professor Chekiren said it was a completely shattered space. Entering it would tear your soul apart, making it impossible to maintain your identity... such a world."

"I see."

"But you survived even after entering it."

"It wasn't my own strength."

"Yes. It was thanks to his help again."

Angel still remembered that moment. The sight of Baek Yuseol stepping into that terrifying space without hesitation.

How could he make such a resolute decision?

"That look in his eyes. I still remember. Baek Yuseol didn't hesitate for a moment as he walked towards you."

Baek Yuseol was a regressor who had repeated countless times. Even if he died, he would come back to life, so death didn't scare him. But this time was different.

"The collapse of identity. He might not have been able to regress and could have been annihilated."

The girls had witnessed how Baek Yuseol turned back time in the "Library of Stars."

"Death."

When he faced death, he turned back time. Repeating the same history, dying and coming back to life, enduring the blood-soaked path.

But...

"The collapse of identity" was not true death. If his body remained intact but his soul was torn apart, he wouldn't be able to turn back time and would wander the mirror world with Flame forever.

Baek Yuseol must have known that risk better than anyone.

"Yet... he didn't hesitate?"

To save her, he approached without a moment's hesitation and reached out his hand.

Flame, with a dazed expression, couldn't focus her eyes properly. Angel, staring at her, suddenly asked.

"...What was that place like?"

"Well... what kind of place was it. Just a crappy place."

Then, she corrected herself.

"But it was quite nice."

Most of the memories from that place were blurry. Like a dream. But... no matter how dreamlike, precious and important scenes remain vividly imprinted in memory, never to be forgotten.

"You will truly be happy. I will make sure of it."

What did Baek Yuseol mean when he said that? To someone like her, who had no memories of "reality," such words would be incomprehensible.

But, was finding meaning in those words important? She was simply quite happy that Baek Yuseol had said that to her.

"Are you happy?"

"Huh?"

"Oh, no. It's just that you suddenly smiled so happily..."

"Did I?"

Am I happy now? She pondered, but the conclusion came quickly.

"Yes. I think I'm happy."

Very much so.

Sunlight streamed through the swaying curtains. Her silver hair shimmered even more beautifully today. Why did the stars appear before the moon had even risen?

"..."

Hong Biyeon slowly opened her eyes. Her ruby-like red eyes gradually took in the world.

"Princess!"

Someone jumped up in excitement. The mere noise and stress caused a tremendous headache, making her frown.

Inform the doctor immediately. Call the nurse. The princess has awakened. Amidst the noise of the faction members, Hong Biyeon remained calm.

"Ah... I've been asleep for a long time."

It wasn't hard to realize that from their reactions. Having been deprived of all her magic for a moment, it was inevitable that she had been asleep for a long time.

"...But I'm still alive."

Every morning, she thought the same thing when she opened her eyes. I'm alive today too. Luxuriously, she decided to live diligently. Because she might not wake up tomorrow.

As she raised her upper body, the faction girls hurriedly ran to support her. The sensation of her silver hair cascading down her neck like a waterfall felt particularly annoying today. Even while she was asleep, someone had consistently taken care of her hair, as it remained soft.

"Water."

"Here it is!"

She quickly but gracefully replenished her hydration.

"Princess, are you okay?"

"Does it hurt a lot?"

"My head hurts..."

"Yes! We'll be quiet!"

She wished they wouldn't shout like that in the hospital. The faction members, trying to be "quiet," made a fuss, calling for nurses and doctors to take care of Hong Biyeon.

Meanwhile, the hospital room door opened.

"...Hello, sister? Long time no see?"

Why had Hong Siwha brought the Adolevit Magic Knights to the hospital room?

"What... what is this?"

"What are you doing!"

The faction members tried to block Hong Siwha, but they couldn't withstand the pressure of the real magic warriors.

"Don't be too wary. Today, I'm here to protect my sister."

"...Protect? Nonsense."

When Hong Biyeon frowned and spoke, Hong Siwha exaggeratedly clutched her chest as if heartbroken.

"Sister came all the way here for you, and you treat me so coldly. It makes me so sad."

"Just state your purpose."

Her headache hadn't subsided, and now Hong Siwha was causing a commotion, making her stress levels skyrocket.

"Purpose? I told you. To protect you."

"What do you mean..."

"It's a royal command."

"...What?"

A direct order from the king? She realized something was seriously wrong. Why had Hong Siwha brought the Magic Knights here? The reason was obvious.

"Stella Academy is deemed too dangerous right now. You were kidnapped again, weren't you? His Majesty wants you to return to the kingdom."

"That..."

"I thought you'd insist on staying here, but how could I let my sister stay in such a dangerous place? I personally requested His Majesty. I suggested that it would be better to protect you in the kingdom, even if only for a short while."

As Hong Biyeon's face turned pale, Hong Siwha, blushing, continued.

"It won't be long. Just until the principal takes some measures? Maybe just for the summer vacation. If that's not enough, maybe a semester. But it's better than staying in a dangerous place, right?"

Lies. Once she returned to the kingdom, they would never let her go back to Stella. It wasn't just about ruining her career; it was about restraining and confining her.

The royal palace was hell for Hong Biyeon. No one wanted her, and no one was on her side. Most importantly, if she left Stella, she would never see someone she could only meet there.

"Not yet... I belong at Stella."

She had planned to solidify her position at Stella, prove her abilities, and gradually increase her influence. But Hong Siwha was trying to take away that opportunity.

"Don't want to? Too bad. It's a royal command."

Hong Siwha declared simply, as if driving a stake into her heart. It was an unchallengeable order. Resistance was impossible.

But...

"Do you think I'll just quietly be confined?"

She was no longer the old Hong Biyeon. She had changed completely after entering Stella and meeting many people. She had no intention of being a caged bird in Hong Siwha's hands.
