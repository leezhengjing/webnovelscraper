# I Became a Genius in the Blink of an Eye at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 196: Everything Melts (1)

A full day had passed since the two calamities struck the port of Lisbon and the entire Adolevit region. The vengeful spirit of the Pirate King, awakened on the coast of Levian, and the rampaging Fire Spirit Flower of the Adolevit royal family nearly obliterated the entire nation. No one was unaware of this fact. 

For the first time in her life, Hong Seryu, the 8th-class mage and queen of Adolevit, had left a blemish on her otherwise flawless record. And... people also knew that it was none other than the third princess, Hong Biyeon, who had perfectly covered for Hong Seryu's mistake. 

Hong Biyeon had controlled the Fire Spirit Flower, which no one had been able to manage since the incident in Adolevit, and used its power to subdue the vengeful spirit of the Pirate King. Could there be a more dramatic story of a life turned around?

"...I told you, I didn't defeat him."

Hong Biyeon's name spread not only through the media of Adolevit but worldwide. It was only natural, given that a mere seventeen-year-old girl had stopped a disaster caused by the avatars of ice and fire simultaneously. 

In contrast, Queen Hong Seryu had done nothing, making Hong Biyeon's actions shine even brighter. She enjoyed the praise and adulation directed at her. Being revered by others was something Hong Biyeon truly loved. 

However, she felt it was unfair that Baek Yuseol, the true hero who had defeated the Pirate King, received no spotlight. Few had witnessed Baek Yuseol, who had appeared by parting the clouds and riding the aurora, defeat the Pirate King with a single strike. It was only known that a bolt of lightning had struck. 

Hong Biyeon tried desperately to publicize Baek Yuseol's achievements, but no one believed her. Who would believe that a high school boy, found unconscious without a scratch, had defeated the Pirate King with a single blow? 

...Though it was equally unbelievable that a seventeen-year-old girl had done such a thing.

"Princess, are you ready to be discharged?"

The attending physician at the university hospital in Lisbon port asked cautiously. Hong Biyeon was physically fine and could have been discharged immediately upon admission.

"...I don't know."

She hesitated. She could return to the royal palace immediately, but she chose not to.

"No, I'll leave when I feel like it."

"Understood."

The hospital in Lisbon port had a well-organized system. Given that the city was a haven for adventurers, many were injured while exploring dungeons or hunting monsters. However, having a direct royal family member admitted was burdensome, and the doctors' expressions showed their discomfort. 

Of course, Hong Biyeon didn't care about others' discomfort. She was selfish.

"Princess... what should we do about the reporters waiting outside?"

Hong Biyeon peeked through the curtain to look outside. A massive crowd was swarming in front of the hospital. The royal knights were blocking them, preventing anyone from approaching easily, but it was clear that patients couldn't be properly admitted with such a crowd. 

But would there even be a need for patients to be admitted? Hong Biyeon looked out at the distant sea. The sparkling, rippling water under the warm sunlight was beautiful. 

Yes, the coast of Levian had begun to breathe again. The waves were gentle but present, the water rippled with the wind, and the temperature had dropped significantly, making the sunlight quite warm. Although the ice hadn't completely melted yet, Lisbon would soon regain its appearance from a thousand years ago. 

With the fall of the Pirate King Black Belize, the Ice Avatar sealed in the pirate ship was also sealed, and the curse of eternal winter was completely lifted. 

Of course... whether this would immediately bring positive effects was uncertain. Lisbon had lost its function as a port for over a thousand years, and no one remembered that era. 

However, it was inefficient for Lisbon, located in a fantastic position at the heart of the continent, to remain frozen and paralyzed. If developed as a port, it could become a stepping stone to make the Adolevit Kingdom even stronger.

"Send the reporters away."

Even though she was selfish, she decided to keep the place quiet for a while, considering the potential injured and the already admitted patients. After all, all the patients here would eventually become her subjects. 

She didn't care about others' things, but she cherished her own. That was Hong Biyeon.

"Then, what about the distinguished guests who are visiting?"

"I told you to send them away."

"Well... they are very high-ranking individuals, and it's difficult for us to send them away easily..."

At the doctor's words, Hong Biyeon brushed her hair back. It wasn't a particularly meaningful action, just to hide her twitching lips. 

Until now, her supporters were limited to students within Stella trying to grab a royal connection and the Duke of Atalec. But now, it was different. Everyone wanted her, and everyone started seeking her out.

"Tell them I can't meet them yet. I'll announce my discharge, and they can come then."

"Announce your discharge...?"

"Yes."

If Baek Yuseol had heard, he would have called her an attention seeker to the core, but no one here dared to say such a thing to Hong Biyeon. 

Her treatment was only natural. The doctors here might have been swept away by the disaster without a trace if not for Hong Biyeon. 

A benefactor to the entire nation. In fact, it might be an honor for the doctors' families to discharge all the patients and take care of her alone.

"Understood."

The answer came not from the doctor but from the knights escorting Hong Biyeon. Normally, an official would assist her, but since the queen hadn't designated one, the knights had to take on such tasks. 

Queen Hong Seryu had returned to the capital immediately after the incident. She knew well how embarrassing and dangerous the incident she had caused was. She would probably prepare something for a public apology soon, but that was none of Hong Biyeon's concern.

"Hmm..."

After the doctors left, Hong Biyeon hummed quietly in the now silent hospital room. Everything was perfect. Could there be a more perfect day? She was so happy that she felt like she could fly away and ascend right now. 

But she couldn't let go of all her worries just yet. One major concern remained.

"When will Baek Yuseol wake up?"

After the battle, Hong Biyeon had first sought him out upon waking up in the hospital. Fortunately, the doctors' responses were positive.

"Physically, there's no problem... but he seems to have suffered immense mental stress. We examined him thoroughly, but we couldn't find the cause. He must have gone through something quite strenuous just before losing consciousness."

Hearing the doctor's opinion, Hong Biyeon felt a pang in her chest. What could have caused Baek Yuseol such extreme stress? He had never shown any signs of struggle despite facing numerous hardships and adversities, so she couldn't help but worry.

"But he will wake up soon. His recovery is surprisingly fast."

Hong Biyeon decided to trust those words. She respected the doctor's knowledge and diagnosis, but more than that, she believed in Baek Yuseol. She didn't think he would fall from something like this.

Knock, knock!

Lost in thought, she heard a knock at the door.

"Princess, Lord Black Matale is here to see you."

"Let him in."

The lord of the Heavenly Ice Palace, who ruled over Lisbon port, and a descendant of the legendary Pirate King Black Belize, Black Matale. The door to the hospital room opened, and Matale, looking healthier than a few days ago, entered. 

Still in his patient gown, he covered himself with a coat to show respect and stood up to greet her, but then he suddenly knelt before Hong Biyeon.

"...What are you doing?"

Following Matale, the men who had come with him also knelt before her. Hong Biyeon couldn't understand the situation but watched them silently.

"We owe you a great debt, Princess."

"I know."

"...It's not just about saving our lives."

Matale raised his head and looked directly into Hong Biyeon's ruby eyes.

"For a thousand years... our Black lineage has fought against a curse."

The urge to go out to sea. However, if they went out to sea, they would inevitably die. The terrible curse that began with Black Belize's generation had grown stronger with each passing generation, to the point where even looking at the beautiful horizon was painful. 

The reason the Black lineage didn't live long was absurdly because they couldn't resist the urge to go out to sea and eventually threw themselves into the ocean, ending their lives. 

Just as Matale's father and grandfather had done, he might have met the same end. But now, it was different.

"Thanks to you, Princess, our Black lineage can go out to sea again after a thousand years."

"...That's good."

Hong Biyeon turned her head to look out the window. Watching the slowly melting sea gave her a sense of relief. Although they were freed from the curse, they still couldn't go out to sea. It was because of the contract with the Adolevit royal family.

"If I become the queen, I'll free your entire lineage."

"...Really?"

"Yes. I'm not joking. Go and live as you please, whether it's piracy or anything else."

"Thank you for your words."

"I'm serious. I will become the queen."

"That's not what I meant."

"What?"

Black Matale looked at Hong Biyeon with clear eyes.

"I, too, have fought against the urge to go out to sea all my life, and now that I'm free from the curse, I have no intention of turning my back on the Adolevit royal family."

"Then... what are you going to do?"

"Let the next generation freely roam the sea. I will stay in Lisbon and grow this city. And... if it grows to a level where it can be of help, I will support you."

"What?"

Hong Biyeon was taken aback by the unexpected words. The value of a port city was significant even in modern times. Although warp holes and airship technology had been developed, it was still highly inefficient to transport all cargo, so water transport remained the main means of trade. 

In that sense, Lisbon port was in a location that could spread across the entire world, and if it grew properly... it would gain immense power. 

Black Matale, who had held a nominal position as the lord of Lisbon, would not remain a figurehead once the city became a true port. His power would skyrocket. If Black Matale, who had gained wealth and power, supported Hong Biyeon, it would be a great help in the battle for the throne.

"That..."

"...If you don't like the idea of a pirate's bloodline, I will give up my position as lord and step down."

"No, there's no need for that."

If Black Matale gave up his position, Lisbon would fall back into the hands of Queen Hong Seryu. That must not happen.

"I've never looked down on pirates. To me, all humans are equal. Whether noble or slave. I judge people by their abilities, not their status."

"...I see."

Although it pricked her conscience, Hong Biyeon could shamelessly say such things because it was somewhat true recently.

"Thank you. I will make this city the best port and support you."

"Yes. I'll visit often, so do your best. I'll provide all the support I can."

"Thank you!"

Black Matale pledged his loyalty to Hong Biyeon, and after he left, Hong Biyeon secretly turned around and clenched her fist. Things were going well. And it felt like more good things were coming. 

And as if to confirm that feeling, exactly a week later, Baek Yuseol woke up.

---

I had a dream.

"I like fast-paced and dramatic developments!"

The voice of Cheongdong December echoed like a bell.

"Good luck!"

Soon, my body began to fall. Normally, humans would feel fear when experiencing a sudden sense of floating, but I didn't even have the energy to feel fear. The world spun wildly, and when I came to my senses, I was already flying over the coast of Levian. 

Soon, the Pirate King Black Belize filled my vision. It was truly massive and imposing. I had seen it in the game graphics, but the pressure felt in reality was on a different level. 

However, I wasn't afraid of it either. Only one thought filled my mind.

"Stab it in the heart!"

The small icicle given by Cheongdong December had grown longer than my height, emitting a blue light. The Key of Aegirix. If I stabbed it into the heart of the Pirate King, where the Ice Avatar was sleeping, I could seal the source of its power.

It noticed me and seemed startled, but it was too late. I used my blink ability continuously without controlling it to its maximum range. Although the range was only 45 meters, it was enough to pierce the heart of the Pirate King Black Belize.

It was simple. I aimed the spear at its heart and stabbed it in.

At that moment, Black Belize's blue skull suddenly turned into mint chocolate chicken. I sat at the table, holding a fork to eat the mint chocolate, but it didn't suit my taste. When I handed it to Flame, who was sitting next to me, she said,

"If you get hit by the magic beam fired by mint chocolate chicken, you'll never be able to eat boneless chicken legs again!"

Unfortunately, Flame had already become unable to eat boneless chicken, but fortunately, she liked Hawaiian pizza, so it didn't matter. However, I didn't like Hawaiian pizza either, so I had no choice but to run away from the mint chocolate chicken chasing me with a broom. 

I lived for the joy of picking out boneless chicken legs, so I ran desperately, but I got caught because I didn't have taxi fare. Then, a Gundam appeared from the sky and knocked out the mint chocolate chicken with a hyper flame jet kick.

"Today, too, I protected world peace!"

I felt terrible looking at the corpse of the mint chocolate chicken, but I thought I couldn't be the only one to see this, so I donated it to a museum. People gathered to see the mint chocolate chicken and suffered.

"Jesus!"

"I can't believe such food exists in the world!"

"I can't trust my visual organs!"

While watching the suffering people with a heavy heart, Angel quietly called me to the backyard of the school and shyly twisted her mint-colored hair, saying,

"I think I actually like mint chocolate chicken..."

At that moment, I opened my eyes wide.

"No, no!"

"What, what... commoner..."

Right next to me, Hong Biyeon was staring at me with bewildered eyes.

"Oh, oh? Phew..."

A dream. It was a dream. I sometimes have dreams where I repeat the same intense experiences, though the story went in a strange direction...

"I had a nightmare..."

When I said that with a serious expression, Hong Biyeon listened with a serious face.

"What kind of dream?"

"A dream where if you get hit by the magic beam fired by mint chocolate chicken, you get cursed and can't eat boneless chicken legs..."

"So I showed it to Flame, and she said she didn't care because she liked Hawaiian pizza..."

"...And then?"

"So I had no choice but to display it in a museum, and Angel said she actually liked it and wanted to eat it..."

Feeling ridiculous after saying it, I glanced at her, and sure enough, her expression was scrunched up in anger, unlike before.

"Yeah. So?"

"Oh, oh... that's it?"

After saying that, I cautiously observed her. Now that I looked around, this was a hospital room. The white wallpaper and medical equipment were quite luxurious, indicating that I had been treated well. 

Even while I was grasping the situation, Hong Biyeon kept asking about the dream, as if waiting for something.

"That's it... why?"

"...Nothing."

Then, Hong Biyeon frowned deeply. She seemed annoyed by the nonsense she had heard.

"Phew..."

Regardless of her anger, I felt mentally exhausted and lay back down on the bed.

"Hey. How long was I asleep?"

"Two weeks."

"What? That's crazy."

"...Why?"

When I was shocked, Hong Biyeon was also shocked.

"I wasted a whole week of summer vacation..."

Hong Biyeon looked at me with an expression that said, "What kind of guy is this?" but I was serious. I had been running non-stop in life, and I had planned to take a short vacation for myself.

"Ugh. The bet with Cheongdong December must have been too much..."

Even though my body was completely frozen, so I didn't need to eat or sleep, I had endured that hardship for three months, so a week of unconsciousness might have been lenient.

"Then... where are we?"

"Lisbon Hospital."

She said that and stood up. Her smiling face looked oddly pleased.

"Oh? Where are you going?"

"I confirmed you woke up, so I'm going to finish the discharge procedures."

"Oh... I see."

"What are you doing? Get dressed."

"Am I getting discharged too?"

"Of course."

Was it that obvious? I wasn't sure, but I couldn't go against the princess's wishes. I got up and rummaged through the closet. There was only my school uniform coat left, so I put it on and waited.

...I waited for a long time. I think I sat on the bed in a daze for almost two hours.

"What the heck. When is she coming?"

Click!

As soon as I spoke, Hong Biyeon, dressed properly unlike me, opened the door and entered.

"Everyone's gathered. Let's go."

"Oh... okay."

I followed her. Hong Biyeon's attire looked suspiciously well-prepared. Soon, I found out why.

Click, click!!

Murmur, murmur.

"It's the princess!"

"The third princess is here!"

"Princess! Please look this way!"

...What the heck?

An overwhelming crowd was waiting for us, enough to make me dizzy. No, they were waiting for Hong Biyeon. They screamed and cheered for her, and the reporters frantically pressed their shutters and thrust their microphones forward. This was bigger than any media attention I had received for all the incidents I had caused combined.

What the heck is going on?

Hong Biyeon elegantly brushed her silver hair back and walked forward. The Adolevit knights cleared a path for her, and she walked naturally through it. Could there be a more perfect model walk? 

Following her like a bridesmaid at a wedding, Hong Biyeon suddenly turned and looked at me.

"Baek Yuseol."

"...Yeah."

Why did she do that? The moment Hong Biyeon called my name, all the surrounding noise disappeared. It felt like we were the only two people left in the world.

"Forget everything you've seen of Hong Biyeon until now."

"What?"

I was puzzled by her sudden words, but she didn't answer and took a step closer to me.

"And remember only the current me."

"What does that mean?"

"Have you ever seen me this happy?"

For a moment, Aether World Online came to mind. In the game, the
