# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 206: An Old Story (2)

Wiiing! Wiiing! Amidst the blaring sirens, rain poured down relentlessly. Boom! As thunder roared, the world seemed to tremble, and Jelliel's pale cheeks turned blue. She stared into the void with vacant eyes, as if her soul had left her body. That place was probably where her father would have been seated.

The World High-Tech Enterprises Conference. A gathering of top politicians and business leaders from various countries, including the chairman of Starcloud, to discuss global economic development. With a participation of nearly 100 people, it was no exaggeration to say that the world's elite were present. Among them, Jelliel's father, Melian, sat at the highest seat. But now, he was gone. All 99 participants testified with pale faces: "Chairman Melian disappeared." Without any warning, he turned to dust right before their eyes.

Swoosh! Boom! The downpour was unusually heavy. The conference, held at the top of the Sky Tower, had ended, and the ceiling was retracted, leaving Jelliel to face the rain directly from the closest point to the clouds. Three days had passed since her father's disappearance. Many things had happened. Wizards from the Grand Tower, considered candidates for the Sky Tower, came from all over the world to help with the search. Hundreds of police search units were deployed outside, and the Ironclad Magic Knights came to assist with security. Over a hundred reporters gathered, forcing 7th-class wizards to set up a police line barrier. Alchemists' sky satellites floated below the clouds, hoping to detect any sign of Melian's life.

To find just one person, countless people from around the world poured in all their efforts. This showed how significant her father was, but it brought no comfort to Jelliel. Like typography soaked in rain, all the surrounding scenery blurred. Nothing caught her eye. In the end, no one could find even a trace of her father, including herself.

"It's my fault." If there had been another cause, another reason for her father's disappearance, she would have had someone to blame. But since it was solely her fault, she couldn't blame anyone and gradually eroded her own emotions. "What have I done..."

It was an evening of torrential rain. She closed her eyes, and when she opened them, the sun was up. She blinked her blurry eyes, and it was evening again. How many days had passed? The dedicated medical team of Starcloud came to check on her, worried as she hadn't moved from the same spot, but Jelliel didn't even glance at them.

"Foolish girl." He came about a week later, one afternoon. The sky was dark, covered by clouds, even though the sun should have been high. "You've caused quite a mess."

He was one of the 9th-class wizards, considered the pinnacle of the world, and known as the pillar of the Western Desert. The Lord of the Full Moon Tower, Haeseongwol. He came to see Jelliel. She mechanically bowed her head when their eyes met, but Haeseongwol, displeased with her state, approached and slapped her hard on the cheek. Smack! Her cheek stung, bringing her back to her senses a little.

"When you sought the ancient Karmenset, didn't anyone warn you?" They did. The greatest wizard in the world, standing right in front of her, had warned her directly. "Karmenset will lead to your ruin." Haeseongwol, who had a relationship with Melian, had always advised young Jelliel. But she didn't listen, believing she was right.

"And now, look at what you've become." She couldn't answer. Even if she had ten mouths, she had nothing to say. Slowly lifting her head, she parted her rain-soaked pink lips and asked him, "What should I do now..."

Clicking his tongue, he looked up at the sky. Melian, with his good nature, often met Haeseongwol for drinks. But now, he was gone. Haeseongwol had also done his best to find him, but there was no way. "What wish did you make to Karmenset?" "I asked for eternal life for my father." "Foolish, ignorant, and stupid. Your ignorance harmed your father."

He looked straight into Jelliel's eyes. The gaze of a great wizard, capable of piercing through a person, made her body stiff as a stone, but she didn't avert her eyes. "Your wish was surely granted." "What?" "What does life mean to you?" It was a deeply philosophical question. For Jelliel, who lived mechanically, calculatively, and rationally, it was an exceedingly difficult question.

"Everyone has a different meaning of life. For some, it might be uncovering the truth of magic, for others, it might be fulfilling material desires." Haeseongwol continued, "But you asked for eternal life without any conditions, rules, or limitations. Every being in the world has a different meaning of life, so how could you ask for that?"

Finally understanding his words, Jelliel's eyes widened, and her lips trembled. "No way..." "Yes. Your fatherâ€™s life was aligned with Karmenset's values. For him, eternal life might mean wandering as a spirit after abandoning his body, just like Karmenset himself."

"Ah..." Jelliel's body collapsed, and she fell to her knees. The complete destruction of the body. That was no different from death. "Even now, your father is probably wandering somewhere in Aether as a spirit, having lost his consciousness. Unfortunately, there is no technology to detect spirits, and even if we find his soul, it is impossible to restore his destroyed body."

Turning his back, Haeseongwol coldly concluded, "Give up on finding your father." The Lord of the Full Moon Tower disappeared into the mist, and Jelliel stared blankly at the spot where he had stood. "Ha... haha..."

Her chest felt like it was about to burst, something seemed to be pouring down her throat, and her head felt like it was going to explode. What was this? It was a sensation she had never felt before. No, it wasn't a sensation... it was an emotion.

---

Although he told her to give up, Haeseongwol mobilized the entire Full Moon Tower to develop new spirit detection technology. He also released elite magic search teams, considering the possibility that Melian might have survived in another form, but there were still no results. About two weeks passed, and both her body and mind were exhausted.

"Student, let me read your fortune." ...A passing fortune teller spoke to Jelliel. She was in the middle of directing the search, so she had no time for trivial matters, but the timing of the fortune teller's visit was so impeccable that Jelliel had to stop. "What? How did you get in here? Get out now!" "Tsk tsk. Young people these days."

The search team tried to chase the fortune teller away, but Jelliel raised her hand to stop them. "Wait." "Yes? Yes, ma'am!" "We'll step back!"

This place was protected by a 7th-class police line barrier, meaning ordinary people couldn't easily enter. It couldn't be explained as a mere coincidence. Jelliel hadn't left the security so lax. "Hehe, want to see your fortune?" Moreover, the fortune teller in front of her felt strange. Even though she was facing a living being, it felt like looking up at a towering mountain. She hadn't felt this way even when facing Haeseongwol. Suppressing her eerie feeling, she spoke, "Yes, I want to see my fortune."

"What kind of fortune do you want to see?" Jelliel hesitated for a moment. "Reunion fortune. Please read my reunion fortune." "Hehe. Longing is beautiful but also a painful emotion." After saying that, the fortune teller looked into the distance. Somewhere far, far away, beyond Jelliel's comprehension. "There must be a place of memories you shared with the one you miss. Go there. If your reunion fortune is good, you might have a lucky meeting. Hehe."

After saying that, the fortune teller turned her hunched back and walked away. Jelliel pondered her words for a long time. "A place of memories..." Jelliel and her father had lived such busy lives that they hadn't created many memories. But there was definitely one place where they had made memories.

---

At that time, Jelliel held her father's hand and boarded a train. "Let's go to Happyland!" The old sign creaked in the rain. This was the train station for the 'Happy Line,' which operated solely for the amusement park 'Happyland.' Now that Happyland was closed, no one visited. The tracks were overgrown with green weeds, old posters were tattered, and the broken walls and stopped escalators gave a desolate feeling.

A place of memories. That day, Jelliel held her father's hand and went on her first trip. The train of the Happy Line, which had stopped operating, moved just for her, and the lights of Happyland, which had ceased functioning, lit up just for her. Splash! Splash! As Jelliel walked, water splashed from the puddles on the ground. Her simple black dress was soaked as she didn't use an umbrella, but she didn't care at all. With each step she took in the empty train station, memories of that day with her father kept coming back. It had been nearly ten years, but her perfect memory hadn't let go of a single moment. She now walked alone in the place she had walked with her father.

Swoosh! As she walked up to the train platform, rain poured through the unmanaged ceiling. Avoiding the scattered rain, Jelliel suddenly sensed a presence and looked up. There stood a boy. With black, messy hair and a Stella uniform, holding an umbrella and scratching his head while looking at a poster, it was unmistakably Baek Yuseol.

"...Why?" Why was that boy here? Rationally, she couldn't understand, but Jelliel found herself approaching him. Splash! Splash! Her steps quickened. She had long since discarded her high heels that hindered her walk. She was getting closer to him faster. No, she was approaching him faster and faster.

"Huh?" Baek Yuseol hastily hid a poster with an ugly person drawn on it behind his back, but Jelliel hadn't even glanced at it. "Huff, huff..." "What, what's wrong all of a sudden?" Baek Yuseol, who had no idea what was going on, was flustered, but Jelliel, upon reaching him, collapsed to the ground as her legs gave out. Swoosh! Unfortunately, it was a spot where the rain poured down, but she couldn't get up and slowly reached out her hand. The place her hand barely touched was... just Baek Yuseol's pant leg. She slowly lifted her head and met the boy's eyes. It wasn't a mistake. The tears in Jelliel's eyes were not rain but genuine tears.

The disaster caused by her mistake. Even the great 9th-class wizard had declared it hopeless. The best search team, capable of finding a grain of salt in the sand, had given up. Everyone said there was no hope. She thought there was no hope. But seeing him, why did hope stir in her heart?

"You, could it be..." Before Baek Yuseol, who had sensed something, could say anything, she finally burst into tears and spoke. "Help me." She had tormented him, tried to harm him, and ruined his life, yet she was asking for help. Now that she had emotions, she understood how vile and despicable her actions had been. The guilt, like an awl, kept piercing her heart, tormenting her. Rationally, she knew Baek Yuseol wouldn't grant her request. Even if she put herself in his shoes, who would help someone like her? She was alone and realized she couldn't do anything by herself. Yet...

"Please, please... I can't do anything anymore..." Jelliel bowed her head to him. "Hey." When Baek Yuseol spoke, the rain suddenly stopped. Swoosh! The sound of rain still covered the world, but strangely, no more rain fell on her head. "Ah..." When she looked up again, Baek Yuseol was holding an umbrella over her. "You'll catch a cold." Saying that, the boy reached out his hand, and Jelliel, trembling, grabbed it with both hands. "Ah, ah..." Knowing what his action meant, countless emotions swirled in her heart.

On a day of torrential rain, even though she had an umbrella, hot tears streamed down Jelliel's cheeks. They were tears filled with emotion.
