# I Became a Genius in the Magic School's Frontline Teleportation

## Chapter 163: The Enigmatic Disappearance (3)

Eltman Eltwin was systematically erasing the presence of the dark magicians from Stella, based on the information he extracted from Kavaren. He did this secretly, so that the dark magicians wouldn't realize their comrades were being killed and flee.

However, as their comrades continued to disappear, the dark magicians who had infiltrated Stella became alarmed. They couldn't figure out who had discovered their identities, so some waited in hiding while others fled.

"Did you hear? The janitor in the east garden suddenly quit."

"What? Really? He was such a nice guy."

"The lady managing the supplies in the Nine Star Tower also disappeared."

"Everyone's quitting all of a sudden..."

"Isn't it because of the dark magicians?"

The revelation that dark magicians had infiltrated Stella caused quite a stir. Parents were outraged that the school couldn't even prevent such an intrusion, leading to harm.

News outlets ran headlines like "Is Stella's Security Crumbling?" and many parents lodged complaints. Most of these parents were nobles or influential figures, causing Stella to waver slightly. However, about a week later, Eltman Eltwin made an announcement, putting the heads of the dark magicians on display.

"I have personally purged the vermin that infiltrated the school. Although I couldn't kill them all..."

As Eltman, once the greatest dark magician hunter, took action, the parents' complaints gradually subsided.

...And among those who contributed to this atmosphere was Anella, who was also in a state of emergency.

"Anella, how's the situation on your end? Eltman Eltwin has discovered our identities through some mysterious means and is purging us all."

"I'm fine."

Anella, crouched in the farthest stall of the first-floor girls' dormitory restroom, conversed with the shadow flickering before her eyes.

"If it gets dangerous, return. Eltman... that wretched man won't just kill you. He'll torture you to the point where you'll beg for death."

"No, I'm fine! I won't be scared by this!"

"I like your confidence. So, how's the mission progressing?"

"Uh... what was the mission again?"

She had completely forgotten about the mission since she infiltrated.

"Well, if it had gone well, Bai Yuseol wouldn't be walking around unscathed. Have you planned to deal with him secretly?"

"That... that..."

She remembered. The original mission was to monitor Young Master Mayuseong and assassinate Bai Yuseol. However, with the young master returning home, her sole mission was to assassinate Bai Yuseol.

It was truly embarrassing, but she had failed to defeat even a first-year academy student and had her identity exposed, with all her abilities sealed. The mission had essentially failed long ago. She should have returned by now, but Anella didn't want to.

She wanted to stay a bit longer and find a way to become human again. Her heart was already set on staying by Bai Yuseol's side, but she couldn't betray the organization recklessly. They would send another skilled assassin, and if someone stronger than her targeted Bai Yuseol... she wouldn't be able to stop them.

"Yes. Trust me. I can completely break his spirit."

"Alright. I trust you. If you successfully complete the mission and return, I'll consider promoting you. It's been over 20 years since you became a dark magician. It's time you had a proper life."

"...Yes."

"Alright, I'll disconnect now."

As the shadow seeped into the floor, Anella leaned against the wall and exhaled deeply.

"Huuu... In my 40 years of life, I've never felt such a heavy burden on my heart. Well, I've lived my whole life without thinking, so it's no wonder. I can only stay at Stella until the summer vacation ends. Before I return, I must gather as much information as possible from Bai Yuseol."

Determined, she opened the stall door and stepped out, only to find a girl washing her hands at the sink, humming a tune.

"Hmm~"

The girl, with short hair touching her shoulders and a small frame, made Anella's expression stiffen slightly upon recognition.

"F-Flame...?"

It was truly peculiar. Despite being 40 years old, she felt intimidated and couldn't speak properly in front of this much younger girl, like a mouse before a cat.

Anella tried to pass by Flame as nonchalantly as possible, but Flame spoke up.

"Aren't you going to wash your hands after using the restroom?"

"Huh? Oh, yeah... I should... even though I didn't use it..."

She reluctantly brought her hands to the sink.

"You were in there for a long time. Constipated?"

"No! I'm not constipated!"

"You're reacting sensitively. If you're not, then you're not."

"...I don't know."

"Then what were you doing in there for so long?"

The stall had a 'shadow barrier' set up, so their conversation wouldn't leak outside. Unless it was a high-level magician, Flame, who was only 4th class, couldn't eavesdrop. There was no need to be scared, but for some reason, even lying felt terrifying.

"...Actually, I was constipated..."

"Take some probiotics."

"...I will."

Anella cried inwardly. It was humiliating enough to be dressed as a high school girl with pigtails, but to be scared of a high school student and say such things... she felt like dying.

"Why are you so scared?"

"...Huh?"

"Is someone going to eat you?"

"No, no! I'm not scared at all!"

Thinking about it, there was no reason to be scared. No matter how notorious Stella was, she was still just a seventeen-year-old student.

"Don't worry. I was going to eat you, but I'll let you go this time."

"...What?"

A chill ran down her spine. When Anella turned her creaking head to look at Flame, she was staring at the mirror.

"Maybe I'm tired, my skin looks bad. I hope it's not acne."

"Um..."

"By the way, that guy is away, right?"

"Yes..."

After the school competition, Bai Yuseol had left with Flower Serin to the Cradle of the Celestial Tree. The fact that the Elf King had personally invited him to his carriage was quite a hot topic, so everyone at Stella knew about it.

"So, I have a favor to ask."

"A favor?"

Flame finally turned off the faucet and looked Anella straight in the eyes. This was a significant matter related to the original novel's event, "Dark Magic Invasion."

In the original, Professor Meizen Tiren turned into a dark magician, causing great harm. However, in reality, Bai Yuseol had dealt with Meizen Tiren, so it was unclear who would cause the dark magic invasion now.

Originally, Bai Yuseol was supposed to investigate it himself, but due to Flower Serin's matter, he couldn't, so he asked Flame to investigate.

And... since it was the first time Bai Yuseol had asked for something, Flame was quite serious about it.

"While that guy is away, be my errand girl."

"...What?"

Anella was so shocked that she couldn't even respond properly.

* * *

Most students returned to their hometowns during the vacation, but Angel Morf did not. To be precise, she couldn't. She had no hometown to return to.

So, Angel took full-time seasonal classes. This was unusual. Many students who didn't return home stayed, but why take extra classes if you had enough credits?

But Angel had a simple reason. She could study more. Specifically... she could study for free. Stella's seasonal classes didn't charge tuition, so it was a great opportunity for Angel, who was short on money.

"People must be fools to pass up free education."

But luck wasn't on her side.

"The professor for the Hyperconnected Education course is suddenly unavailable, so the lecture is canceled."

"...What?"

The professor for her course had suddenly disappeared. The Hyperconnected Education course was notoriously unpopular, with fewer than twenty students enrolled, so they didn't even try to find a substitute and just canceled the class.

"My class... It's okay! I filled my schedule to the brim for the summer vacation, so there are still plenty of lectures to attend."

"The instructor for Advanced Mathematics 3 is unavailable due to personal reasons..."

"The Basic Design Theory course is..."

Angel's classes started getting canceled one by one. The reason was mostly the same.

"The professor disappeared."

It wasn't like they were preparing for a summer horror special, so why were the professors disappearing?

Not all classes were canceled. Popular lectures with many students had substitute instructors, so Angel attended those and continued her studies. However, she couldn't take the classes she wanted, and sometimes the subjects changed, which was frustrating.

She had planned to burn through the summer vacation with classes, but her schedule was now full of holes.

"Haaa..."

"You're really something. The ones who study well are always the stingiest."

During lunch, Angel's friend, Marillen, who stayed in the dormitory instead of returning home, commented. Marillen didn't need to take classes, so she stayed in the dormitory and occasionally came out for lunch, often finding Angel exhausted.

"Studying builds a wealth of knowledge. It becomes flesh and bone, so you shouldn't neglect it."

"You sound like my mom... Are all top students like you?"

"...I don't know?"

Angel was a genius and a hard worker, which everyone acknowledged. But what about other top students? Hong Biyeon rarely studied in public, so it was hard to tell. Haewonryang and Flame were often seen in the library but not as intensely as Angel. Mayuseong and Bai Yuseol... always seemed to be playing around. Yet, they always had top grades, making many students envious.

"You're the most intense."

"So what? I can't even be number one."

"...Aren't you third in your grade?"

"Yes."

"You're so annoying... If you ever get stabbed, know it was me."

Joking around, Angel thought about the other S-class students. None seemed to be studying seriously during the summer vacation. Even Bai Yuseol had left for the Cradle of the Celestial Tree, invited by the Elf King.

He must be enjoying a feast in the White Castle by now.

"He's really unique..."

Bai Yuseol was smart without studying. He was a regressor. Normally, one could dismiss it as "because he's a regressor," but this case was different.

"The Soul Orb shone so brightly..."

Thousands of spectators might not have understood, but Angel, knowledgeable about the Soul Orb, was deeply moved. The Soul Orb shining so brightly meant Bai Yuseol had a "pure soul" like celestial beings or spirits.

"A pure soul..."

It might seem like a simple term, but having a pure soul required extremely strict conditions. Most intelligent beings, including humans, broke these conditions from birth. They must not commit sins, harm any living beings, be tainted by anything impure, or have any impure thoughts.

In extreme terms, ignoring trash on the street or having lewd thoughts about the opposite sex could corrupt the soul. It seemed impossible for intelligent beings to meet these conditions.

So, intelligent beings couldn't be pure. That was normal.

...Until Bai Yuseol shattered common sense again.

"What's the reason?"

Bai Yuseol hadn't lived an ordinary life. He had turned back time countless times, killing many and committing sins. Yet, his soul was pure. There must be a reason.

"Hmm..."

Angel loved to explore and had a personality that delved into things that piqued her curiosity.

After lunch.

"I'm going to be a worm again~!"

"Yes... wriggle hard."

"Okay! You too, good luck!"

Sending Marillen, excited for her nap, back to the dormitory, Angel headed to the library. Originally, it was time for the Hyperconnected course, but since it was canceled, she decided to browse some books.

"Let's see... pure soul, pure soul..."

She remembered seeing papers and research on the purest and most beautiful souls in the library.

"Ah, found it."

She found a thick book titled "The Purest Souls in History" and reached for it. But a white hand reached out from the opposite side, grabbing the same book.

Angel looked at the other person. A girl with long silver hair tinged with red, reaching her waist, and eyes sparkling like rubies, Hong Biyeon.

Of all people, she had grabbed the same book.

"What? Are you reading this too?"

"...Take it. You read it."

Like someone caught doing something they shouldn't, Hong Biyeon quickly withdrew her hand and turned to leave, but Angel stopped her.

"No, let's read it together."

"...What?"

"If I borrow this, I won't return it for a week... Won't you regret it? You'll be dying of curiosity."

Why would a princess be so curious to find such a book? It was obvious. She must have the same reason as Angel. And since Hong Biyeon was quite smart, putting their heads together might yield some plausible answers.
