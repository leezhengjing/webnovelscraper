### Magic Survival (5)

As the Magic Survival continued, Flame ran to the waiting room with Anella, where the participants who had been eliminated were being moved.

"Emergency patient! Emergency patient! Deploy the healers immediately!"

"What on earth happened here?"

"How did they get burned? What happened on the stage?"

Since there was no reason for injuries to occur during battles in the virtual space, there were no medical staff on standby to treat injuries. This could be considered a weakness of Stella Academy, the only institution in the world that operates a virtual space.

"Excuse me, please move aside!"

Although the crimson flames were somehow being suppressed by the magic of Stella's faculty, the wounds were not being properly treated. Flame pushed through the crowd.

"Who are you?"

"You're a student! Why are you here? Get out immediately!"

"Wait, isn't that student Flame? I heard she learned healing magic. We need her help right now!"

"Can you come over here? We have an emergency patient!"

There were five or six patients with burns all over their bodies. Even in such an urgent situation, a healer could only handle one patient at a time. However, that was only true for ordinary healers.

Flame stood among the groaning patients lying on the floor, gathered her hands, and quietly chanted a spell with her small lips.

"…Light."

In fact, not many words are needed for a magic spell or prayer. Only a sincere wish is important.

Whoosh!!

A dazzling golden light filled the waiting room, and the patients' wounds began to heal rapidly. It was a miraculous phenomenon that even the priests of the Holy Kingdom could not achieve. Such a divine ability could only be wielded by the saints of the Holy Kingdom.

However, because she was healing multiple people at once, the efficiency was poor, and her mana, vast as the sea, was quickly depleted. Moreover, since the wounds were caused by magic from a higher-level dark mage, it was impossible to heal them easily. For now, all she could do was prevent the wounds from getting worse. Of course, even that was an excellent emergency measure.

"The healers have arrived!"

Thanks to her, the patients' lives were sustained until proper doctors and healing mages arrived.

"Student, you should rest now!"

"Oh no, you look pale. It seems you've exhausted too much mana at once and are experiencing fatigue."

"〇."

As Flame staggered and collapsed, Anella hurriedly caught her.

‘Ahhh, there are too many mages around. Here a mage, there a mage. I'm a dark mage, but…’

Just as her mind was about to go blank, a mage approached and comforted her by placing a hand on her shoulder.

"You must be very confused after seeing such a sudden sight. Do not speak of this incident anywhere. We will handle it."

"Uh, um…"

"Absolutely."

When a Stella official sternly ordered her to keep silent, Anella nodded with a bewildered expression. However…

"…Who said you could keep it a secret?"

"Who! …Oh, Princess?"

Unfortunately, the one who witnessed the scene and could not be silenced was Hong Biyeon, the princess of Adolevit. She had appeared in the waiting room at some point and was examining the patients' conditions with a deeply furrowed brow.

If one could not grasp the situation after seeing the thick dark magic, they would not be qualified as a magic warrior cadet.

"Did a dark mage infiltrate Stella?"

"…Yes, that's correct."

Hong Biyeon finally resolved one of her doubts. The reason why Baek Yuseol had been running around more desperately than anyone else, even getting involved in childish pranks, was because he knew in advance that a dark mage would invade the tournament and was trying to find and eliminate them.

A regressor is bound by a contract with the stars and cannot reveal future events. In other words, he was once again struggling alone to resolve the incident. This fact made Hong Biyeon's expression grow cold.

"This time, you better not think it will be easily overlooked."

No matter how much he was admitted as a cadet, he was fundamentally a member of the royal family of one of the three strongest nations in the world. Adolevit had entrusted the princess's safety to Stella, but Stella had failed to prevent the infiltration of a dark mage… This would undoubtedly become a significant controversy.

After Hong Biyeon gave a short reprimand and turned around, the officials could only bow their heads in silence. It seemed that this school competition would not end smoothly.

* * *

It wasn't just the participants and officials who noticed something strange. Some of the spectators watching the Magic Survival also realized that something unusual was happening in the tournament.

"Your Majesty, it seems there is a problem with the tournament."

"…It appears so."

Kkot Seorin habitually touched her rosy lips, only to realize she was wearing a mask and withdrew her hand. It was a habit that emerged when she was deep in thought.

‘Participants feeling pain…’

Other school competitions usually involve powerful protective gear, with a shield spell that students cannot break. Instead, the system calculates life points to determine the eliminated participants. Thanks to Stella Academy's virtual reality system, such cumbersome processes were unnecessary, allowing for battles that felt real.

However, in the virtual reality, participants should not feel pain. Yet, in the scene Kkot Seorin just saw, a female student was screaming with her whole body on fire. Since multiple scenes were being broadcast simultaneously, that scene was not shown in detail, and most people probably did not notice anything strange even if they saw it.

But those particularly sensitive to dark mages would have sensed something suspicious.

"I will go and check the situation."

When Orenha said this and stood up, Kkot Seorin stopped him.

"There's no need. This is Stella."

Even if something happened, they would undoubtedly handle it well. There was no need for them, who had come as spectators, to move.

‘At least a 5-risk level. If they are hiding their power, even higher…’

If a dark mage had indeed infiltrated the Magic Survival and was attacking the students, it could be the 'Spirit Slayer' Orenha had mentioned. If the Spirit Slayer revealed their identity and unleashed their power, Kkot Seorin's keen eyes would immediately detect it. That would be the end. The culprit would not escape this place.

‘I will return the favor.’

Clenching her fist, she made a firm resolution. She would not let them die peacefully.

* * *

At the very edge of the Magic Survival stage, two boys were fighting.

Boom! Crash!!

Flames, as if they had swallowed the night sky, exploded, and a small hut was blown apart. In the midst of it, Dok Cheol-gwang extended his left palm forward and then thrust his right fist, which he had pulled back with all his might.

Whoosh—Boom!!

A fierce whirlwind swept through, devouring everything in its path. The overwhelming destructive power and wide range were unbelievable for a casting that took less than a second!

But his opponent was not to be underestimated either. He lightly leaped to avoid it and then enveloped Dok Cheol-gwang in black flames.

"Hiya!"

Bang! Clang!

As energy burst from Dok Cheol-gwang's body, the flames oxidized. He then stepped on the rubble and leaped continuously.

"Hup…!"

When Dok Cheol-gwang suddenly charged, Berenkal was greatly startled and retreated far back. But even that distance was easily closed, and a fist was thrust at him.

Crack! Boom!

A small typhoon erupted from the fist! Moreover, when he stomped the ground with his right foot, a wall of rock formed behind Berenkal, preventing him from escaping. Since becoming a dark mage, Berenkal could no longer use other magic and could not deploy a shield, so he had no choice but to defend with flames. Fortunately, flames were strong against wind.

‘This guy is insane…’

As a 5-risk dark mage, Berenkal was a formidable opponent in the Magic Survival. Naturally, he thought he could easily defeat anyone in a one-on-one situation. 

‘Where did this monster come from…?’

His combat sense was so extraordinary that it was hard to believe he was human. He was pushing a 5-risk mage like himself with only 4th-class magic. Moreover, his muscle mass was a problem. Ordinary mages did not need much muscle. Muscles did not help much in the use of magic, so maintaining basic physical fitness was enough.

However, it was a bit different for knight-type mages who engaged in close combat. The 'Power Jump,' a technique that allowed for a large leap over short distances using the rebound of mana, put a great strain on the legs and required precise control of mana. But no matter how much control one had, the leg muscles would inevitably be strained, so knight-type mages had to train their muscles.

However, even that was to a certain extent. Dok Cheol-gwang had not only precise control of mana but also developed his leg muscles to the point of possessing overwhelming mobility.

Boom!

The speed at which he closed tens of meters in an instant! The relentless rapid-fire of power jumps without getting tired! Moreover, the destructive magic that erupted with every punch!

"Tch!"

If Berenkal were an ordinary 5th-class mage, he might have been defeated by Dok Cheol-gwang here. However, a 5-risk was still a 5-risk. Crimson flames erupted from the ground, enveloping Dok Cheol-gwang's body.

Boom! Boom!!

Since it was virtual reality, he was not wearing a proper shield robe, so Dok Cheol-gwang had no choice but to accept the flames. However, even with his body on fire, he only let out a slight groan and did not make any sound of pain. One of the greatest pains a human could feel was the pain of burning.

"Do you not feel pain…?"

Then, Dok Cheol-gwang revealed his white teeth and laughed heartily.

"With willpower and muscles, I can overcome these flames!"

"Crazy…"

Berenkal made a tired expression and ignited crimson flames in both hands. From the situation, it might seem that Dok Cheol-gwang had the upper hand. However, the reality was that Berenkal had the advantage. Berenkal could inflict real damage on Dok Cheol-gwang, but the reverse was not possible. Even if they fought purely, it was uncertain who would win, and in an unbalanced situation, it was impossible for Dok Cheol-gwang to win.

But did Dok Cheol-gwang not know this? The number of survivors was decreasing, and the competition area was narrowing to the next stage. From the beginning, his goal was to prevent that entity, who could attack as if it were reality even in virtual reality, from harming other cadets. He was buying time. Winning the competition? His own safety? Those things did not matter. If there was a dark mage in front of him, he would stand and point his staff at them. That was the duty of a magic warrior.

‘…Unbelievable.’

Hiding far away and secretly watching the situation, Hanabon-yu trembled as he looked at Dok Cheol-gwang. His whole body was already covered in flames, and he seemed barely able to stand. However, Dok Cheol-gwang did not fall. It felt as if the boast he had thrown earlier about never having fallen was true.

‘But, that's the limit.’

He could barely use Power Jump and was only able to fend off the incoming flames with a wind fist. The battle would soon be decided. Dok Cheol-gwang would… die.

‘That can't happen.’

He thought all magic warrior cadets were like him. Just for the certificates and graduation. Ignoring the dark mages, wanting to work in a safe and comfortable place with a high salary, and attending the academy for that reason. After all, in this day and age, where could one find a hero-like spirit of a magic warrior from a fairy tale?

He had firmly believed that. But right in front of him stood someone who could truly be called a 'mage.' Although he had always been jealous of Stella's cadets, now he only thought of saving that person.

…When he came to his senses.

"Yaaahhh!!"

Hanabon-yu was running. Towards Berenkal? No, there was nothing he could do. Although he was considered an elite, he knew well that he could not demonstrate his skills in a real battle against a dark mage. So he ran towards Dok Cheol-gwang.

"What, who are you!"

Berenkal, startled, sent flames flying, but it was too late. A sharp ice spike shot from the tip of Hanabon-yu's staff pierced Dok Cheol-gwang's heart. Dok Cheol-gwang looked at him without saying a word. Even though he seemed almost unconscious, he stood firmly on his two feet. Finally, his figure turned into a light and disappeared.

"…You bastard."

Berenkal began to emit an enormous amount of dark magic from his entire body. He had intended to finish off the most troublesome and annoying fly as painfully as possible.

"How dare you interfere…"

Whoosh!!

Crimson flames exploded, covering the entire area.

"Eek…"

Thud!

Hanabon-yu's legs gave out, and he collapsed to the ground. If he were hit by those flames, he would surely die. But it was okay. He could save a hero by sacrificing himself? No. He still couldn't become such a great person. He just believed in his life points, which were already crawling on the ground because he hadn't taken a potion earlier.

Whoosh!!

"Die, you bastard!"

Finally, Berenkal's black flames exploded! As the wave of fire, writhing like a snake, rushed in, Hanabon-yu's form turned into light and disappeared.
