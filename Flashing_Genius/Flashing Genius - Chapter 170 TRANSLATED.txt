# Chapter 170: The Seventh Main Tower (1)

"Princess Hong Biyeon has gone missing."

No matter how much the staff tried to keep it quiet, the disappearance of such a prominent student spread quietly but thoroughly within Stella Academy. The students were already on edge due to the ghost stories circulating, and now, the same eerie circumstances were happening for real.

Flame viewed Hong Biyeon's disappearance from a slightly different perspective. In the original novel, "disappearance" meant being taken to the Seventh Main Tower. In the original plot, except for the protagonist Angel, no one else was taken there.

"You are not qualified."

Even if they disappeared for a while, the victims were only found collapsed somewhere in the hallway with that bright red sentence. However, for some reason, the protagonist Angel was taken to the Seventh Main Tower and, with the help of Haewonryang, uncovered the truth of the incident and overcame it together.

In that episode, Hong Biyeon did not appear at all. At that time, she only showed up to torment the protagonist. But now, out of nowhere, Hong Biyeon was taken to the Seventh Main Tower?

"Wait a minute. What does 'qualified' mean?"

It was something Flame had never thought about. When reading the novel, he had assumed that "qualification" was just a plot device that would be explained later. But looking back, the novel ended without ever revealing what that qualification was.

What if that "qualification" applied not only to Angel but also to Hong Biyeon? What if she was taken because the plot had deviated from the original?

"This is driving me crazy... Originally, a proper incident was supposed to occur about a week from now, but I didn't expect this to happen so soon."

It felt like the story's main focus had shifted from Meizentiren to another entity, accelerating the plot significantly.

"...This won't do."

Flame looked at Angel, who was fidgeting with an anxious expression.

The two girls, Morf and Adolevit, who had been arch-enemies, had grown through past incidents and now had a relationship that could be called a rivalry.

"We need to go in and save her."

So, when Flame said that,

"Let's do it."

Angel could answer without hesitation.

"Wait a minute. Do you even know how to get in? Even the professors can't enter, so how do you plan to...?"

Anella asked with a horrified expression, but both Angel and Flame already knew the way. The only way to walk in on their own two feet without being dragged in like Hong Biyeon.

"I tried to be as cautious as possible until that man arrived... but there's no choice. We don't know when Baek Yuseol will return, and we can't just keep waiting. Even without him, we need to be able to act on our own."

"Let's go. To save that brat."

"Yes."

Flame and Angel made a firm resolution and turned to leave.

"Ugh... Yuseol told us to stay put..."

Anella, who was caught in the middle, was left with a tearful expression.

---

"Ugh..."

Hong Biyeon slowly opened her eyes to the cold sensation on her cheek. She tried to move her arms, but they seemed to be bound by something.

"What...!"

She urgently looked around, but her vision was dark. The magic to illuminate her surroundings was among the higher-tier knight spells, but she couldn't create light without her staff. She bit her lip and tried to curl up her body, but suddenly, flames appeared in the air.

Whoosh!

"Ugh...!"

As her vision suddenly brightened, Hong Biyeon couldn't bear the dazzling light and tightly closed her eyes.

"Hahaha! Even with the blessing of flames, you can't handle the brightness, can you? I heard rumors that you have complete immunity to fire..."

Despite the unpleasant tone of the voice, Hong Biyeon couldn't open her eyes for a while. Slowly, she endured the pain and barely managed to lift her eyelids.

There was a familiar face.

"Professor Chekiren?"

"Yes! It's a pity to see our top student princess like this."

With his bulging belly and greasy skin, always wearing a creepy smile, Professor Chekiren stood there, someone she had never liked.

"The magic of your family is truly an art. The purest and most noble flame... I wondered why purity mattered when it's just a phenomenon of oxygen and mana combining to combust, but now I understand! This is what it feels like. I see why they call it Adolevit."

At first, she couldn't understand what he was saying. But when she saw the flame on Chekiren's fingertip, Hong Biyeon was horrified.

"That's... my flame?"

The purest and clearest flame that only the pure bloodline of Adolevit could produce. While it didn't differ much in power from other flames, it was a symbol of the magic of the twelve disciples of the first mage, Adolevit, and could not be produced by just anyone.

Yet, it was manifesting at the fingertips of a complete outsider.

"Could he be... Adolevit?"

No way. The pure bloodline of Adolevit always had blazing red eyes like flames. But Professor Chekiren had deep purple eyes, and his specialty wasn't even in the flame category.

"...Who are you, really?"

"Oh dear. Hong Biyeon, is that how you speak to a professor?"

"Just answer me."

"Tsk, the descendants of the first mage are all so rude..."

Chekiren clicked his tongue but then smiled broadly as if he was in a good mood.

"It's the 'final project' left by the current Dark Mage King."

"The final project...?"

"Yes. Why is it that only the twelve families can use the magic left by the first mage? The great Dark Mage King was the first to question that and planned this project."

He walked somewhere with a cheerful step. Hong Biyeon naturally followed his gaze.

"A mirror?"

There was a large full-length mirror reflecting Hong Biyeon. But something felt off. The colors in the mirror world were completely reversed. The Hong Biyeon in the mirror had black hair and blue eyes, and her expression was so gloomy that she didn't feel like herself at all.

"The twelve families were chosen by 'Constellatio.' Do you know what that means?"

"...How would I know?"

"Puhaha! It's funny, really. Standing closer to the 'perfect world' than even us dark mages, yet you don't feel it at all. If you had tasted that infinite world even once... you wouldn't be able to escape."

"Dark mages... you say..."

"Yes! Oh, was I not supposed to reveal my identity? Well... hmm. No, it's fine. Right? Yes, it's fine. The leader has given permission, so it should be okay, right?"

"Wait. What are you talking about?"

"Yes, yes. It's fine. Anyway, I infiltrated this school solely for this project left by the Dark Mage King! Phew, I almost lost it to that brat!"

Chekiren started rambling incoherently, making it hard to understand what he was saying.

"A madman... He's completely lost it."

But the thought that her life was in the hands of this lunatic filled her with creeping fear.

"...I need to stay calm."

She slowly looked around. Now that she noticed, this place was truly bizarre. The sky outside the windows of the open hall was red, as if the colors were inverted. Moreover, the strange mana scent felt everywhere was unmistakably from the other world, the "Persona Gate."

But something felt off. The Persona Gate was an artificially designed world, structurally unnatural compared to reality. Yet, this place was perfect. Just by the scent of the flowing mana, she could tell it was different from other Persona Gates, as there were no puzzles to solve.

"You're lucky. Very lucky."

Chekiren chuckled as he looked at Hong Biyeon. His gaze was so disgusting and terrifying that she wanted to run up and stab his ear with a staff, but being tied up was her eternal regret.

"Half a century ago, I inherited this because he couldn't complete it. Hehe... And now, two descendants of the twelve disciples have enrolled..."

Mumbling and rambling. Chekiren talked to the air, laughing and getting angry by himself. Then suddenly, he stopped talking and turned his head to look at Hong Biyeon. His gaze, with his head tilted oddly, seemed devoid of any self-awareness, making even Hong Biyeon, who wasn't afraid of ghosts, feel a chill in her heart.

"Hmm? Hmm~ Hmmm!"

But Chekiren wasn't interested in Hong Biyeon at the moment. He was hearing the voice of another "someone."

"...Chekiren."

A rough and sinister voice echoed, as if scratching and tearing at his brain. However, Hong Biyeon couldn't hear it. This voice could only be heard by dark mages who had offered their souls to the other world.

"Yes~ It's me! As you requested, I have offered the child blessed by the stars."

Offering the descendants of the twelve disciples as a sacrifice would grant power. This was the condition of the contract Chekiren had made with "someone" sleeping in the Seventh Main Tower. But the contract wasn't over yet.

"Are you satisfied with just this...?"

"What? What do you mean?"

As Chekiren made a puzzled expression, the voice continued.

"My other servant is... bringing the true child of the stars here..."

"The true... child of the stars?"

"You must offer that child to me as a sacrifice..."

This was the first time he had heard such a thing. Moreover, another servant? Wasn't he the only one honored to be his servant?

"...Could it be that bastard Raiden?"

He had suspected it. That shameless face must be hiding selfish intentions, trying to get a piece of the action. But it didn't matter. He didn't know who the true child of the stars was, but if he offered them as a sacrifice, he would gain more power.

"Hehe, I'm looking forward to it."

Chekiren was genuinely grateful to the Dark Mage King he had never met. Leaving Stella without properly executing this great project, thanks to that, he alone reaped the benefits.

"Who's next~"

With an excited step, he left the place, and Hong Biyeon, left alone, leaned against the wall with her mouth tightly shut.

"Haa..."

Mana slowly drained from the circle in her heart, and her mental strength was gradually exhausted. It felt as if her soul was leaving her body.

She had to endure. She had to endure, but she couldn't, so she closed her eyes.

"I'm... sleepy..."

Just a short nap. She had been running non-stop, so a short rest should be allowed.

Thinking that, she fell into a deep sleep, as if she would never wake up again.
