# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 221: The End of Summer (1)

...One of the main episodes, which I didn't even realize had started, was completed. The system message from the Constellation Project sounded distant as my consciousness was hazy. The truth of Morf. What was this episode about again? I can't quite remember.

"Hoo..."

[The skill 'Breath of the Spirit' has been deactivated, significantly increasing divine erosion.]

[Your body is overloaded due to excessive use of the item 'Wheel of Dawn.']

I've heard the saying that one's muscles scream in pain. I didn't understand it before, but now I do. This isn't just at the level of screaming; it's more like begging for mercy. I hastily drank potions of various kinds, but the pain didn't subside.

'I'm really going to die...'

I took a deep breath and leaned back. I hid among the high branches of a dense tree, far from the battlefield, thinking that I wouldn't be seen, so I even took off my mask.

Thud, thud, thud!!

The sound of horse hooves echoed noisily from afar. The magic warriors were arriving one after another, unaware that the situation was already over. The magic warriors who had already arrived and grasped the situation looked at the fallen Bai Yao Hu Hwa-ryeong and Isaac Morf with astonished expressions.

How should they interpret this situation? They couldn't even believe that the claws of the 9th Risk had appeared, let alone that Isaac Morf, the Grand Duke who protected the continent, had betrayed the magic world and become a dark mage.

However, soon enough, the magicians united and began to shout in unison.

"Grand Duke Isaac Morf has turned into a dark mage!"

"But Princess Hong Si-hwa successfully repelled him!"

"Oh! Look at his corpse! Truly a heroic feat!"

"I can't believe it. That Grand Duke Isaac Morf betrayed the magic world..."

The magicians surrounded Hong Si-hwa and praised her achievements. In truth, they all knew why Isaac Morf had turned into a dark mage. Just by looking at the circumstances, it was clear. The unsealing of Bai Yao Hu Hwa-ryeong. To defeat it... he chose a noble sacrifice himself.

But what does such 'truth' matter? The living must live. So, with the head of the Morf family, one of the two great pillars, dead, it was wise to side with Adolevit.

I closed my eyes, taking in the scene for the last time. Hong Si-hwa Adolevit would affirm the magicians' praises and conceal the existence of Bai Yao Hu Hwa-ryeong. She knew well that revealing it would only increase the number of people speculating about the truth. Although the achievement of defeating Bai Yao Hu Hwa-ryeong was also significant, she gave it up to cleanly eliminate any rumors. A wise and ruthless woman.

"Ugh..."

Like a machine forced to operate with mismatched parts, my whole body creaked. It seemed I would need to recuperate here for a while... But more importantly, there was one problem.

'...How do I get back now?'

The day I returned to the past, ten years ago. Eun Se-sip Il-wol imprinted the way back to the original timeline in my mind. In fact, there was nothing I needed to do; all I had to do was wait.

'When the time comes, I will open the way for you to return. Until then, do not interfere with the past timeline and wait quietly!'

In the end, I did interfere massively with the past timeline... but if my predictions are correct, the future should not have changed at all. ...Probably.

'Did something go wrong?'

It was about time for Eun Se-sip Il-wol to send down the rope of salvation, but there was no news. Quite a bit of time had passed, and with no sign of anything, anxious thoughts began to creep in. What if something really went wrong because of my actions, and the connection with the present Eun Se-sip Il-wol was severed? What if the future Eun Se-sip Il-wol doesn't remember me at all?

"...How do I get back?"

Suddenly, the future seemed bleak.

---

The monsoon of Hawol Plain continues throughout the summer. This year, it was particularly severe, to the point where trade routes were completely blocked, filling the merchants' wallets with nothing but worries. The Star Cloud Trading Company was also having a tough time this summer. With the head of the company, Melian, missing for a long time, and Zeliel also putting all her work aside to search for him, how could the company run properly?

The first half of this year saw Stella's students continuously announcing new types of magic, causing the fast-moving economic market to be in turmoil, and Star Cloud was experiencing unexpected chaos.

Thud! Thud!

Listening to the sound of rain hitting the window, Zeliel was lost in thought.

"You haven't been able to focus lately."

It had already been a week since Melian was safely rescued, and fortunately, his health was not a major issue, so he immediately returned to his main job. He had been running around so much to catch up on the backlog of work that dark circles had formed under his eyes, which were always well-maintained.

"...I'm sorry, Father."

"It's alright. It happens."

Drinking cheap coffee, Melian looked at his daughter with concern. Even after his return, she had hardly shown any signs of joy. She was never a child who always smiled energetically, but she had never shown such a gloomy expression either.

Come to think of it, recently, there had been a contact from Haeseong Wol, the head of the Full Moon Tower. He seemed unusually concerned about Zeliel's condition, even though Melian thought he was just inquiring about his own well-being.

"Zeliel."

"...Yes. Please speak, Father."

He took a deep breath. He had never been nervous dealing with world-class figures, but as a father dealing with his daughter, every word was cautious.

"Is it because of that boy?"

He had heard the details of the incident from Haeseong Wol. His disappearance was due to Zeliel's mistake, and she had tried her best to rectify it but failed. Then, miraculously, a boy named Baek Yu-seol appeared and brought him back. However, the boy had disappeared into the rift of time and space as a price for saving him, and even Haeseong Wol said he could never be found again.

"No, Father. It's not that, so don't worry."

Though he mustered the courage to ask, Zeliel forced a smile and shook her head, making it obvious that she was lying.

"...I see."

Melian hid his bitter expression and left the office. He was worried about his daughter, but the backlog of work left him no time to think about anything else.

Click!

Swoosh! Thud, thud!

In the now silent office, only the sound of rain hitting the window was loud.

Scratch, scratchâ€”

Zeliel, who had been scribbling on a document with a quill pen made through alchemy, finally sighed. Nothing was going right. It felt like there was a hole in her chest where her heart should be, leaving her empty.

Drip.

"Oh..."

As the ink smeared on the paper she was writing on, Zeliel hurriedly replaced it.

"Sigh..."

She couldn't even understand why she was like this anymore. Had there ever been a time when she had no will to live like this? Why do people live? As a high elf, she would live for hundreds of years more, but was there any meaning in such a meaningless life?

Thinking that she couldn't go on like this, she got up and went out to the balcony. The ceiling blocked the rain, but it couldn't stop the cold raindrops from splashing on her face. Perhaps it was fortunate that she could at least clear her mind this way. She leaned against the balcony railing and stared at the green horizon of Hawol Plain.

It was truly a beautiful place. ...She hadn't realized it before. The 'beautiful scenery' that everyone else talked about. But now, for some reason, she could deeply appreciate the 'beautiful scenery' like others. Things she hadn't noticed before began to come into view. Beautiful, ugly, exciting, sad, joyful, and boring things. These were the emotions of ordinary people in their lives. She could finally feel all those emotions, but why did she only feel helplessness and despair?

'...Nothing will change anyway.'

Shaking her head to clear her mind, Zeliel turned to go back to the office. But something felt off.

'Huh?'

The wind that had been blowing her hair gently had stopped.

'What is this...'

The strange feeling of fear coming before curiosity was awkward, but Zeliel forced herself to turn her head back to the balcony.

"...What is this?"

Water droplets were suspended in the air. ...Countless droplets. The rain that had been drenching Hawol Plain had stopped. The lightning that had been striking down decorated the background like a painting. It was as if time had stopped...

Zeliel couldn't believe her eyes and closed them tightly before opening them again. At the end of the horizon, an old man was hanging. With the white lightning that split the world in half behind him, he quietly watched Zeliel.

Splash!

The old man stepped on the rain and approached Zeliel. Step by step. As the distance closed... ironically, Zeliel felt a certain emotion welling up in her chest before fear. She could tell. This was hope.

Finally, the old man reached the balcony and looked down at Zeliel. The mysterious old man, with his beard fluttering despite the lack of wind, stared into her eyes and spoke abruptly.

"In this vicinity... the one most closely tied to Baek Yu-seol is you."

"...Is that so?"

At the mention of that name, Zeliel's heart pounded even more violently.

"Do you want to bring him back?"

"Yes."

"If you fail, you may have to offer your heart as a price. Are you still willing?"

It didn't take even a second. The time it took for Zeliel to nod her head.

"That's an exaggeration."

"...What?"

"You don't need to risk your life. I just wanted to know your earnestness."

He turned and looked at the distant horizon. Thinking that it was always a beautiful scenery, he spoke to Zeliel.

"What you need to do is simple. Just earnestly... wish for him. I am not tied to that boy, so I cannot do it, and I have to ask you. Can you do it?"

If that's all, there's no problem at all. Because... that's what I've been doing all along.

"...I can do it."

As Zeliel, who had made up her mind, nodded, the old man smiled contentedly.

...Swoosh!!

Soon, as if the old man's existence was a dream, he scattered into the air, and the rain began to pour down again. Zeliel, who was staring at the spot where the old man had disappeared, packed her things as if possessed and ran out of the office.

Flutter...

In the now empty office, only a few sheets of paper fluttered, dancing with the wind and rain.
