### Chapter 178: Unreal (2)

Since that day, the bullies from Iwol High School stopped coming to the school. Naturally, the girls who had been acting as their lackeys also faded away. The students, who had been living in fear of the bullies, cheered at the story of Flame.

"…Huh? Me?"

"Yeah! You're amazing. I heard your boyfriend took down all the bullies?"

"Ah, no… He's not my boyfriend."

"Really? Anyway, there were many witnesses who saw it!"

"Yeah, yeah. I heard the bullies even declared they wouldn't come near Iwol High School again!"

As soon as Flame arrived at school, Han Choyeon and her friends were in an uproar. However, there were many questions in Flame's mind. Who were all these witnesses in that narrow alley? How did the rumor spread so quickly? And why would the bullies be so scared of just one high schooler and declare their surrender?

'This doesn't make any sense.'

"Who's your boyfriend? I heard he's super cool."

"I heard he's from our school? But no one knows his identity because he was wearing sunglasses!"

"Maybe he doesn't want his identity to be known?"

"Crazy girls…"

Sunglasses or not, he was wearing his name tag openly. The more she listened, the more confused she became.

"He's not my boyfriend…"

"Still, he jumped in to save you, which means he likes you, right?"

"I don't know…"

But, well… Listening to this, she didn't feel bad. After all, it was true that the boy had helped her, and now all the students were praising her. Feeling a strange sense of happiness, Flame couldn't help but smile. She felt like the protagonist of the world.

* * *

A week passed since that day. Curious as ever, Flame searched the school for 'Baek Yuseol' but couldn't find him anywhere. She even checked the attendance records of the first and second years but found no similar names.

'Who was that guy?'

She wanted to thank him for saving her, but he had disappeared without a trace.

"Top student, Flame! Congratulations. You ranked first in the national mock exam."

Flame snapped out of her thoughts at the voice calling her. Standing on the podium was always a burden, but she had become used to it after consistently ranking first.

"Thank you."

As she received the certificate, applause filled the auditorium. As she stepped down, Han Choyeon patted her shoulder.

"Wow, amazing. How can someone from this lousy school rank first in the nation?"

"Well, I'm naturally smart. You should stop reading those internet novels and study. You're smart too…"

"What are you talking about! And they're not internet novels, they're romance fantasies."

"Same thing."

Really, romance fantasy? She didn't understand why people read those. There wasn't enough time to focus on reality.

"No! But the one I'm reading now is about a princess who loves…"

"Enough about novels. Want to go eat tteokbokki for lunch? My treat."

"Oh, sure! Let's go!"

Unlike herself, who was from a middle-class family, Han Choyeon was poor and always hesitated to buy even tteokbokki. Flame often wanted to treat her to meals, but she refrained to avoid hurting her friend's pride.

'But today, I have a good reason.'

Tteokbokki? She could look forward to it. She had a special course planned.

* * *

Evening came. Feeling good, Flame decided to go to a coin karaoke with Han Choyeon and other friends.

"She's gone~!!"

"Ah! My ears!!"

"Time and the wind of the seasons~!! Take you away~!!"

"Ahhh!"

Amidst the noise, Flame's singing stood out with her exceptional skills.

"Don't look for me again~!"

"Wow…"

The must-sing song in karaoke, So Chan-whee's "Tears." Flame's high notes were perfect, showcasing her unmatched talent. As they left the karaoke, the girls felt a sense of satisfaction.

"Ah, that was refreshing."

"Yeah, you really let it out…"

"Flame, how about becoming an idol? You're pretty and perfect for it."

"Don't be ridiculous. Not everyone can be a singer."

"No, I really think you could."

"Stop talking nonsense. Filling someone's head with false hopes can ruin their life."

Flame was very realistic. Becoming a singer? In this era, there were countless pretty, talented teenagers who could sing and dance. Even those kids often failed in the idol industry. She wouldn't even consider it.

After the karaoke session, Flame and her friends spent time shopping for cosmetics and eating snacks. They thought they should enjoy themselves whenever they could.

Then, they noticed a crowd of young people gathered on the street.

"Hey, looks like there's a busking performance."

"Yeah, a lot of people are gathered."

As they approached, they realized it wasn't just an ordinary busking performance.

"Hey, isn't that the famous YouTuber Kim Baekgwang from the street casting karaoke?"

"Really? Wow, it's my first time seeing him in person."

"He's so handsome…"

Everyone reacted to the famous YouTuber, but Flame was indifferent.

"Is he famous?"

"You don't know? Have you been living under a rock?"

"Well, it's possible not to know…"

While Flame and her friends were chatting, a participant started singing. She was quite beautiful, and the audience's reaction suggested she was talented, but Flame wasn't impressed.

After the song ended, YouTuber Kim Baekgwang continued the show, drawing maximum engagement.

"Alright, any volunteers for the next song?"

With a live audience of 50,000 to 100,000 viewers, aspiring singers always flocked to his broadcasts. However, the next participant was usually pre-selected. The show was mostly scripted.

Knowing this, the high school girls still shouted loudly.

"Here, we have a great singer!"

"This way, this way!"

"What? Are you crazy?"

Flame was embarrassed as her friends pointed her out. She didn't expect the YouTuber to notice, but to her surprise, Kim Baekgwang reacted.

"Alright, we have our next participant! How about a song?"

He subtly showed a message indicating she didn't have to participate if she didn't want to. But with her friends urging her and the YouTuber's unexpected reaction, Flame reluctantly agreed to sing one song.

"Our next participant is Flame from Samwol High School! Haha, our viewers thought you were an idol trainee. Is that true?"

"No."

"Oh, I see! Any plans to debut?"

"I need to go home and study."

"Got it!"

The large tablet screen in front of the camera showed multiple chat windows from different platforms, all buzzing with comments.

[Study?]
[Is this for real?]
[First time seeing someone say they need to study on a broadcast]

As Flame took the microphone, the chat exploded. She had a feeling she knew why.

'Sigh…'

"Shall we start? What song will you sing?"

"Um… I'll sing 'Say Yes' by Hwal, 3 keys up."

"Oh! Bold choice! Looking forward to it!"

The audience reacted enthusiastically to her choice of a high-pitched song raised by 3 keys. As Kim Baekgwang adjusted the computer and audio, music started playing. Flame took a deep breath and began to sing, but something felt off.

'…Huh?'

In the distance, among the crowd, she saw Baek Yuseol, carrying a motorcycle on his shoulder. He looked exactly as he did a week ago.

'Wait, hold on…'

She wanted to rush over and talk to him, but the music started, and she had no choice but to sing.

"Say Yes~"

Her singing was emotional and explosive. The high notes soared, and the low notes tickled the ears.

"Wow… This is…"

Kim Baekgwang was stunned, and the audience, including the chat, seemed frozen.

"Now hold my hand~ Say Yes"

As she reached the climax, about 10 seconds later, the chat exploded with reactions.

[What's with that voice…]
[If you don't hold her hand, she'll kill you]
[Who didn't hold her hand?]
[Hey, go hold her hand quickly]

Dozens of comments per second. The donations were about to crash the server, and the viewer count skyrocketed. Flame's popularity was evident.

'This is it!'

Kim Baekgwang realized. This level of buzz would spread across all communities. Usually, participants sang one song and left, but ending it here didn't seem right.

After finishing the song, Flame calmly held the microphone and looked at Kim Baekgwang, who quickly resumed the show.

"Wow, I was stunned. How long was I out? 30 years? No way."

He joked with the viewers while approaching Flame.

"You're amazing. Are you sure you're not an aspiring singer?"

"No."

"That's a shame. You could debut right now."

"Thank you."

Flame glanced at the chat, aware of the overwhelming response. It was a bit burdensome, and she wanted to leave quickly, but the chat was demanding an encore.

"Wow, the viewers are asking for another song. No pressure, though. You're a senior, right? Don't want to stress you out."

"Ah…"

She understood the situation. Leaving now would be awkward.

"…I'll sing one more."

Flame loved singing and didn't mind the enthusiastic response. She glanced at Baek Yuseol, who had moved to the front, looking serious without his sunglasses.

He mouthed something to her.

'Don't do it.'

His lips clearly formed a negative.

"What…"

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing."

"What song will you sing?"

"…Kim Sangmin's 'You.' Please play it."

As she looked at Kim Baekgwang, then back at Baek Yuseol, he shook his head, eyes closed, as if telling her not to.

But she couldn't stop now. With 100,000 viewers, stopping would be embarrassing. Regardless of Baek Yuseol's reaction, the music started, and Flame began to sing.

"How should I…"

Again, the reaction was similar. The audience fell silent, focusing on her singing. In this world of silence, she felt like the center of the universe. She understood why singers worked so hard to stand on stage.

For this thrilling moment. For everyone to focus solely on her voice.

"Through the long night~ When morning comes~"

Her song climbed towards the climax. Like climbing a mountain, everyone looked up to the peak.

Then, just before the climax, Flame instinctively looked for Baek Yuseol. She felt she had to.

He was watching her seriously. Then, he raised his right hand, holding a cheap plastic pen.

'What?'

What was he planning to do with that? As she wondered, he threw it.

Thunk!

The pen pierced through the audio equipment.

Pop!

The music stopped. The audience's shocked expressions were etched in Flame's mind. Kim Baekgwang rushed to the laptop, but it was useless. She knew why the music stopped.

'Is this even possible?'

Could a plastic pen pierce through a computer and audio equipment? In this unbelievable reality, Flame couldn't stop. She continued singing without the music.

"You~ In the rainy street~ Left alone~"

The climax burst forth. Kim Baekgwang stopped fixing the equipment and watched Flame.

"Thinking of you~"

Ignoring the sound issues, Flame raised the pitch by 2 more keys.

"Alone at night~ Where you fall asleep~"

The song raced towards the end, finally reaching its destination.

"Huff, huff…"

Wiping the sweat from her cheeks, Flame put down the microphone. After a moment of silence, applause erupted. But to her, it was just noise. She looked for Baek Yuseol, who shook his head and walked away.

"Hey, wait…!"

"That was amazing! Everyone, give a big round of applause for Flame from Owol High School!"

"Ah…"

Like a mirage, Baek Yuseol's figure faded and disappeared into thin air. All that remained was the enthusiastic applause and cheers. Seeing the people whistling and waving, Flame couldn't help but smile.

"Haha…"

Baek Yuseol? What did it matter who that boy was? She was happy. She was alive. She should enjoy this moment.

She waved to the people and the camera, knowing she would never forget this day.

…But.

'Why do I feel so uneasy?'

As she stepped off the stage, receiving her friends' cheers, she touched her name tag. She was too happy. So happy that she felt something bad was coming.
