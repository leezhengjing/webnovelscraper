I Became a Genius at the Magic School 154

36. Magic Survival⑹

Boom, rumble... I briefly lifted my head at the sound of explosions nearby. Although I was hidden behind a pile of rubble and covered with the artifact 'Invisibility Robe,' making it unlikely for my position to be discovered, I still felt a bit uneasy.

"Phew."

Fortunately, it seemed they were fighting among themselves and hadn't noticed this place. The number of remaining participants had dwindled to about thirty. As the match entered its final stages and the area became more confined, I still hadn't encountered the main villain of this episode.

"Isn't this strategy complete nonsense?"

I had heard that if you drew enough attention, Berenkal would come looking for you. My kill count had already surpassed 17. While it might be because I fought well, it was mainly due to my overwhelming skill in handling 'artifacts.' 

Having enjoyed various content like tournaments and battle royales for ten years, I had to learn various strategies and artifact usage to win with the 'character Baek Yuseol,' who had no long-range attack means and a fragile body. That knowledge was quite useful here, and I managed to survive among the elite competitors with the 'Lü Bu Meta.'

"Hoo, I really thought I was going to die when I faced those Jeremy faction guys."

No matter how skilled you are, you die if three people gang up on you. I survived thanks to a natural disaster that occurred, which could be considered a stroke of luck. By crafting a robe with special materials, I could move slightly even during an electric natural disaster, and I used that to take down the three of them one by one. They were all second-year students, so I barely managed to win... but a win is a win.

"Berenkal hasn't been eliminated yet, so where could he be?"

The reason for using the Lü Bu Meta was to draw Berenkal's attention to me before more victims appeared. However, the fact that he hadn't come yet made me slightly uneasy. Victims are inevitable. Yes, I know that. Still... failing to prevent avoidable damage made my heart ache.

"Hoo..."

When I checked my life points, they had risen to more than half. I had plenty of potions left from defeating other players, but continuous battles had left me mentally exhausted.

"It would be nice if I knew Berenkal's location..."

Just as I thought that.

-Ah, ahem, can you hear me?

"Huh?"

Suddenly, a voice echoed in my head.

-You can hear me well. Baek Yuseol, it's me, the principal. It seems the match is going well.

"Principal...?"

I was a bit taken aback, not expecting someone to speak to me from outside.

-Yes. Normally, I strictly forbid external contact, but... given the situation, I have no choice. Baek Yuseol, a serious problem has arisen in the tournament.

I immediately sensed what it was. Somehow, Elteman Eltewin had realized that a dark mage had infiltrated the Magic Survival.

-As the principal of Stella, it's shameful to admit, but... a rat has entered the Magic Survival.

I could almost hear the grinding of teeth, even though it was a mental conversation.

-So... I want to ask for your help.

"What kind of help?"

-I'll tell you the dark mage's location. Can you find and deal with him?

I never expected to receive such help. I nodded without hesitation.

"Tell me, and I'll go immediately."

-There's no need. Thanks to one of our students stalling for time, the dark mage is currently outside the match area. He's trying to join the match area quickly...

Someone stalled for time? There weren't many Stella participants, so I quickly figured out who it was.

'Dok Cheol-gwang.'

One of my favorite characters from my gaming days. He wouldn't have just passed by after seeing a dark mage.

-Here's the location.

A map appeared before my eyes, showing Berenkal's location. He was still outside the match area but was running towards it at an incredible speed. Outside the barrier, life points would deplete rapidly, so he must have a significant potion supply.

Then I noticed something. The map also showed the locations of other survivors, and in a straight line towards Berenkal was 'Jelliel.'

"I need to go myself."

Jelliel was a villainess. Even more vicious than Hong Bi-yeon. She had committed countless wrongs and would commit countless more in the future... but I couldn't let her die here. Was it because I feared the future might change? That was part of it, but I also saw potential for her redemption. If she could repent and use her intelligence, wealth, and magical talent to help save the world... she could be as helpful as the three main heroines. And more than anything, I didn't want someone I knew to die.

-...Please. I'm really sorry to ask a student to do this.

"It's fine. This is what a magic warrior must do."

I didn't have the sense of duty of a magic warrior, but I was doing a good deed, so why not wrap it up in grandiose words? Once decided, I acted immediately. Grabbing the level 3 'Large and Sturdy Iron Club' I had just obtained from the supply crate, I stood up.

"I'm on my way."

* * *

Swoosh...

A downpour began. The Magic Survival field often experienced sudden weather changes, and when it rained like this, it was hard to detect the presence of approaching enemies due to the sound being almost completely blocked.

Jelliel hid under the crumbling roof of a ruin, staring blankly into the air. She had taken down three enemies on her way here. She wasn't particularly interested in the tournament and had no desire to win, but she moved because she had entered.

And... if she won, it could be a great source of pride for her father.

'But what does it matter.'

She hadn't seen her father for three years. The more she thought about it, the less she understood. The Magic Oath was absolute. There was a reason why almost no mage signed it lightly. Through this oath, Baek Yuseol could have gained much under better conditions. The daughter of the Starcloud Merchant Guild, a high elf blessed by the World Tree, had many uses. She could ask for land, mines, noble titles, or meetings with high elf elders. She wasn't vain, but she knew she was considered very beautiful. Jelliel, being perceptive, knew how men usually looked at her. So, an ordinary person might have asked for such conditions...

But Baek Yuseol wanted nothing. He only wanted to change Jelliel's heart. Why? She pondered all night but found no answer.

'Would Baek Yuseol gain anything if I hated my father?'

She considered various scenarios where Baek Yuseol might gain socially or commercially, but...

'Nothing.'

There was no benefit for Baek Yuseol if she hated her father. If anything, it would be a loss.

"Sigh..."

She never understood why humans sighed, but now she found herself doing it. It was time to move. She gathered her staff and belongings and stood up. To win, it was best to secure a spot in the center. The problem was that everyone thought the same. She had the misfortune of landing on the outskirts, making it impossible to reach the center in time. So, she planned to circle the perimeter and then dive into the center. Frequent skirmishes on the outskirts would draw attention, and there was a risk of defeat. When it rained, visibility was greatly reduced, so she had to be careful while moving. She cautiously left the ruins and climbed a hill.

[Weather: Downpour]
[Time: 21:43]

Inside the stage, day and night changed rapidly, and it was getting dark as the match entered its final stages. Even in the poor visibility, Jelliel used her high elf's excellent vision and agility to quickly navigate between hills and trees.

Then.

Boom... Flash!

The sky flashed white, and lightning struck.

"Ugh...!"

An ancient tree at the top of the hill caught fire. Despite the heavy rain, the fire didn't go out, and Jelliel realized it was an 'event' she had only heard about. Special events inside the stage could yield artifacts that were normally unobtainable.

"...I'm lucky."

Other players might have noticed it, but Jelliel was the closest, so she could quickly grab it and leave. As she approached the burning tree, something like a staff fell. It was a top-tier artifact obtainable in the stage. Thinking she was one step closer to victory, Jelliel grabbed it, but at that moment, she sensed someone behind her and quickly turned, pointing the newly acquired staff.

"Did you think I wouldn't notice you sneaking up on me?"

Trying to deceive an elf's ears was laughable. The opponent was wearing a robe, which was tattered from numerous battles. Their defense points were likely very low.

'I can win.'

In Magic Survival, battles could be decided by artifacts and equipment as much as individual skill, so Jelliel was confident of victory. But suddenly, the mysterious opponent tore off their robe.

"Huh..?"

For a moment, Jelliel couldn't comprehend the situation. Small horns protruded, eyes with red sclera, and sharp fangs. It was unmistakably a dark mage.

'Is this also an event...?'

No, there was no event involving dark mages. The match was purely about mages competing for survival, so why would a dark mage event appear? Moreover, the opponent was wearing a system assist bracelet that only players could wear. The opponent was a player. But a dark mage. The relationship was incomprehensible even to Jelliel's sharp mind.

"Who are you...?"

She asked cautiously, but he only grinned, revealing his fangs, and ignited crimson flames in both hands.

"Ah...?"

The dark magic was palpable. She realized he was a 'real dark mage.' If she got hit by that magic... she could really die.

'I have to run.'

It took only three seconds to make that decision. But by the time she decided, the dark mage had already launched a sinister black flame at her.

...Whoosh!!
