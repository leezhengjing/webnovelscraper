# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy
## Chapter 179: Unreal (3)

Honestly, when I saw Flame being completely engulfed by the full-length mirror, I was extremely flustered. Flustered? No, I had a myriad of thoughts. Initially, I kept my distance, but as we attended the same school, experienced various incidents and accidents together, and shared secrets, it seemed that Flame and I had grown quite close.

When I saw Flame being swallowed by the full-length mirror, I... despaired. To the point where I wanted to give up everything. It felt like I was endlessly falling into an abyss of helplessness. Even the cheat item, the binoculars, didn't explain how to save Flame from the full-length mirror.

But then, the one who extended a hand of salvation was none other than the "Constellation Project." As usual, the Constellation Project was quite unfriendly, omitting detailed explanations. To summarize, the world inside the full-length mirror revolved solely around Flame's "happiness." A perfect world where any desire could be fulfilled without any pain, trials, worries, or efforts, and everyone would praise me without any effort.

However, as with such worlds, if one becomes completely engulfed in happiness, they can never return to reality. True death. The collapse of the mind, losing both body and self.

"Make her realize reality."

Thus, I fell into "Flame's world." It was a familiar place. The smell of exhaust fumes, the dull sky, the forest of towering gray buildings, and the bustling, noisy modern people. My hometown, Earth.

For a while, I stood there, unable to move as if nailed to the spot. The first thought that came to mind was to visit my home. It was meaningless. I had no remaining family, and I wasn't even sure if this world was real or fake.

"Stay strong, Baek Yuseol."

I had no choice but to make a resolution to myself. Although I felt weak returning to my hometown, my task was clear. To make the foolish Flame come to her senses. What would happen if my mind weakened before that?

Even without a strategy guide or anyone to advise me, I somehow came up with a method. At first, to make Flame realize the unreality, I intervened in events out of the blue.

"Actually, you wanted this."

Like a protagonist from a 90s action movie, I appeared coolly with sunglasses and tried to escape on a motorcycle. It was a failure. Instead, it made Flame even more noticeable, making it a worse move than doing nothing.

When I came to my senses again, a week had passed. Time Skip. It's a very convenient feature, but it's quite troublesome because you can't know what happened in between. Fortunately, I was able to meet Flame right away. This time, she was singing.

"Now hold my hand, say yes!"

With countless cameras and a handsome host who looked famous at a glance. No doubt, after this event, Flame would become incredibly famous.

"One more song!"
"One more song!"
"Encore! Encore!"

People were calling for an encore. At that moment, I accidentally made eye contact with Flame. I shook my head. I was ignored. I had no choice but to break the audio system directly, but...

"Rain on the street, left alone..."

Flame ended up singing the entire song a cappella, receiving an even hotter response. "Damn it..."

Realizing that my actions were dragging her deeper into unreality, I slammed the ground hard. The concrete cracked and formed a spiderweb pattern. At that moment, I realized. This is Earth. A world where superpowers, magic, swords, and different races do not exist. Yet, I still possessed superhuman abilities.

[Teleport]

I could still use my most powerful magic. ...It seemed there was only one way left.

* * *

"Hey, hey, hey, Flame! Did you see it? Did you see it?"

A week had passed since the street performance. I had no memory of the time in between, but time flew by so quickly. I'm only nineteen, but time is truly mysterious.

"What did you see?"

When Flame, who was writing in her notebook, asked while picking her ear, Han Choyeon exclaimed excitedly.

"Your YouTube video has surpassed ten million views! It's probably a record for a video of an ordinary person! It's still spreading through communities, so it might go even higher!"

"Really? It's not like I get any money from it, so why are you so excited?"

"Don't you know that everyone who got a sudden burst of fame on Kim Baekgwang's YouTube channel debuted as singers? Even the famous Choi Gakdo appeared on 'Are You a Singer?' thanks to that video."

"I'm not going to be a singer."

That was sincere. While singing was enjoyable, setting a future goal to become a singer was a different story. Singing was just a hobby. I drew the line there. But still... it was quite pleasing that people were interested in my singing, increasing the view count.

"I think a major agency will come looking for you soon at this rate."

"That's nonsense."

"Seriously?"

Flame shook her head, but Han Choyeon's words had some credibility. The ranking of [#Real-time Trending Videos] was rising every day, and it finally reached number one! It was a video featuring just an ordinary person, yet it had such explosive power, making it a huge topic... or so it was supposed to be.

Exactly four days later, in the morning. When Flame went to school, she heard a fantastical story.

"Flame, look at this!"

"What?"

The video Han Choyeon showed had the tag [#Real-time Trending Video No.1]. But the title was quite a sight.

[Modern Superhero? The Appearance of a Mysterious Superpowered Person!]

"What's with the superhero nonsense...?"

Flame, who didn't particularly like superhero movies, thought it was a movie advertisement and was about to skim through the video, but something felt off. The noise in the video was so loud that it was hard to hear, the screen was shaking severely, and the focus was off, making the blurry quality bothersome. And most importantly, the content of the video.

"What is this...?"

In the video, a terrorist group was shooting guns on the street. Considering the background was South Korea, it was quite shocking, but not entirely impossible. Anyone could get a gun. But the boy in a school uniform who appeared then completely shattered the sense of reality.

"Is this teleportation...?"

The boy moved at the speed of light, wielding a lightsaber to destroy the terrorist group. When he looked somewhere, he was already there. He deflected bullets with his lightsaber or cut down terrorists, reminiscent of a sword master from a fantasy novel, earning the ridiculous nickname "K-Sword Master."

Despite the absurd nickname, the video was real. Truly. A superpowered person existed in reality.

"This video wasn't taken by just one person! All the trending videos right now are of that person!"

"Show me more."

Although they were videos of the same incident from different perspectives, Flame meticulously imprinted each one on her retina.

"Familiar."

Although his face was covered with a mask, she could instinctively tell.

"That's... our school uniform, right?"

Baek Yuseol. That boy was undoubtedly Baek Yuseol.

* * *

The male uniform of Saeol High School consists of navy pants, a white shirt, and a navy jacket. In other words, it's a very common uniform that can be seen anywhere in South Korea. But does that mean netizens couldn't find out where the uniform was from?

"Did you hear? It's our school."

"It's actually me."

"Your physique is different."

"I lose weight when I'm active and gain it back afterward."

"Idiot."

The fact that the "K-Sword Master" in the video was a student of Saeol High School had already spread widely, causing reporters and YouTubers to flock to the school to find him, creating quite a commotion.

The boy, abbreviated as "K-Soma," didn't stop at defeating terrorists once. He traveled all over the country, defeating criminals and solving various incidents, and in just a few days, he was already being called a real hero.

[Let's scientifically analyze the principle of high-speed movement]
[What material is the lightsaber made of?]
[The relationship between Saeol High School and the boy?]

All the world's issues were focused on Baek Yuseol. As the first superpowered person to appear in the world, even the President of the United States mentioned him, and rumors said that secret foreign organizations had infiltrated Korea to recruit him. Of course, no one knew how much of it was true.

However, there was one thing people misunderstood. The high-speed movement the boy used was not just a superpower but "magic."

Why? Flame could understand that fact to her core. The true nature of that ability was the magic "Teleport." It was quite awkward, alien, and unpleasant. The fact that knowledge I hadn't learned kept swirling in my head, as if another person's memories were constantly invading me.

"What's wrong, Flame?"

"Nothing."

On the way home. The school gate was noisy. Another huge crowd had gathered. Reporters must have come to find the mysterious superpowered boy. Flame, who had gotten used to it over the past few days, was about to take a detour, but something was different today.

"Flame... look over there!"

"Huh?"

Han Choyeon, in a daze, pointed at something. Flame looked in that direction with a nonchalant feeling.

"...What the heck?"

And she couldn't help but be surprised. A handsome young man in his early thirties, wearing a sleek black suit and standing next to a luxurious foreign car, was there. Even though she wasn't interested in the entertainment industry, she couldn't not know him. The representative of "Daebak Entertainment," who created the world's top boy band, "Gapppa Boyz," Kim Gapsu. He had come to this school in person!

"Kyaaa!"
"Please look this way!"

The real star power of Kim Gapsu overshadowed the mysterious K-Soma, and people screamed and took pictures, forgetting their original purpose. He stood there, enjoying the attention, and then turned his gaze as if he had found someone. Their eyes met.

"...Huh."

Flame tried to ignore him, but as if confirming her ominous premonition, Kim Gapsu walked straight towards her. The crowd parted like the Red Sea, and the quick-witted Han Choyeon had already jumped back, leaving the two of them facing each other.

"Hello? You're Flame, right?"

"...Yes."

"I'd like to have a chat with you. Is that possible?"

Although she wanted to confidently say "No," she couldn't withstand the intense gazes from all around and hurriedly nodded. Kim Gapsu, satisfied, smiled handsomely and guided her to the limousine.

"Then, shall we go somewhere quiet?"

* * *

Kim Gapsu took Flame to a high-end café in Cheongdam-dong. He didn't do something crazy like renting out the entire café. Instead, he let the place be crowded with ordinary people, probably for the "publicity" it would generate on social media.

"I'll get straight to the point. I want to groom you as the next 'Gapppa Boyz.'"

"Ah... yes..."

There was nothing else to say but "Ah" and "Yes."

"You don't seem very enthusiastic. I know you've turned down many offers so far. So, I'm planning to guarantee your academic and daily life."

"What...?"

"You don't want to give up your daily life, right? Being a star is tiring."

He flicked his hair in a way that was both cool and childish. It was ridiculous, but Flame nodded roughly.

"I'll respect all your daily life and relationships and never interfere. Instead, you'll live the life of a star on the other side of your daily life."

What nonsense. "What benefit does that give you, Mr. Kim?"

"Of course, there's a benefit. If you like the life of a star, you might fully become one of us."

"...Excuse me. Is this a live broadcast?"

"Huh? Haha, are you already conscious of the camera? Unfortunately, no. But we can't stop the hot interest gathering here."

Why say such lines if it's not a live broadcast? Flame wanted to retort but held back. Are all stars like this, or is it just him?

"First, here's the contract. It respects your school life and dual life as a trainee, and also specifies..."

Without listening to Kim Gapsu's words to the end, Flame stared intently at the contract. All she had to do was write her name. None other than Kim Gapsu. The Kim Gapsu of Daebak Entertainment. With his word, the ordinary life of a high school girl would end, and the life of a star would begin.

"...Why now?"

"Because it's the right timing, I hurried to find you."

Currently, all the attention was focused on Baek Yuseol... "K-Soma." "Do you know the saying that issues are contagious? When something explosively attracts attention, another hot topic can shift the focus."

She didn't know. She didn't want to know.

"I'm aiming for that. The fact that Kim Gapsu personally met and debuted the high school girl Flame... wouldn't that be the next hot issue?"

Indeed, Kim Gapsu hadn't come to her without any thought. He was sincere. Sincerely... thinking of making her a star.

She hesitated, holding the pen, contemplating over and over.

"Sign it, quickly."
"Take back the popularity that was taken from you."

Originally, the name that would still be circulating on YouTube and various SNS sites would be mine, Flame, not Baek Yuseol. A real-life superhero? He might be amazing and globally famous, but that's it. He didn't reveal his face and couldn't appear in official settings. The popularity of a world-class star, supported by the best entertainment company, couldn't be stopped by a single hero.

"Let's go, Flame. Become a star with me."

All she had to do was sign. There was no need to hesitate. He promised to respect her daily life, which was one of her biggest concerns. By signing this contract, she would have the opportunity to sing freely in front of the world.

"Become the world's greatest star."

Someone whispered. Was it Kim Gapsu? Or her own self? She didn't know. But Flame's trembling hand had already reached the contract.

Thud! The pen touched the end of the contract, and just as a dot was about to be made.

"Don't give up on yourself."

Hearing a boy's voice from somewhere, Flame snapped out of it and dropped the pen.

"...No. I don't think I'm cut out to be a singer. The attention from people... is burdensome."

"What? But..."

Kim Gapsu tried to say something with a flustered expression, but Flame hurriedly stood up. She felt that if she listened to him any longer, she would really sign it. So. The world turned sideways.

"Huh...?"

Glass shards and brick fragments scattered everywhere. The sound of something exploding, the violently shaking view. When she came to her senses, she was lying on the ground.

"Ugh..."

Her whole body was covered in dirt. Her uniform was completely ruined by the concrete dust, and her limbs were scraped, bleeding profusely. She glanced at the wall, which had a gaping hole.

"What the heck happened... A bomb attack in broad daylight?"

Flame cautiously walked out through the hole in the wall.

"Kyaaa!"
"Run away!!"

Boom! Crash! Screams. The sound of something exploding and breaking. Thump, thump. Her heart pounded. Wailing sirens could be heard from somewhere. On second thought, she remembered studying it. That wasn't just a siren; it was an air raid warning.

That's it. Step back and hide. Or run away. She knew well that further curiosity would only shorten her lifespan. Yet, why couldn't she retreat? Flame took one step, then another, slowly moving forward. Finally, when she reached the middle of the road, she saw it.

"Roar!!"

A green-skinned monster, roughly the size of a small house, was smashing the city with traffic lights in both hands.

"...A monster?"

The boundary between reality and unreality blurred and rose like a mirage. I knew what that was. An "ogre." A monster that inhabits forests, with agile movements despite its large size, making it very dangerous as it moves through trees.

How did I know that? Before she could resolve that question, she made eye contact with the ogre. The sound of dozens of helicopters approaching from the sky could be heard, but it was too late. Those things couldn't stop it.

Thump, thump! The ogre approached her. She still couldn't move her feet, standing there blankly. Was she scared? No, that wasn't it. Just...

"Just kill it, right?"

She didn't feel the need to run away. Flame didn't run. She extended her right hand, and there was a staff in it. Its name was "Ego La Echoov." A beautifully crescent-shaped staff, she didn't know where she got it or why she knew its name. But does that matter? Countless magical knowledge swirling in her head kept clamoring to be unleashed.

"Light."

It was a simple action. She just spun the staff once and struck the ground. Flash-!! The golden, brilliant pattern of a magic circle burst forth, enveloping the ogre. ...Thus, magic was revealed to the world for the first time. She knew. At this moment, everyone was paying attention to her. And something... had become irreversible. She sensed it.
