### The Genius Who Became a Blink Mage at the Magic Academy

#### Chapter 205: An Old Story (1)

**Today's Diary: Entered the gambling den and lost everything! The end.**

‘...I lost it all.’

If I think of it as an entrance fee to increase Eunsae Shibwol's favorability, it might not be that expensive, but it was such a large sum that I couldn't help but feel the sting. Of course, thanks to the copyrights of my items, a tremendous amount of money was piling up in my bank account, but the feeling of losing all the cash in front of me was different.

People often say that when you lose all the money you poured into gambling, you should consider it as buying a life lesson at a high price. No, that's just a mental victory. Even with the blessing of Yeonhong Chunsamwol, I couldn't shake off this bitter feeling.

“...Hehe.”

While I was shedding tears of blood alone, Eunsae Shibwol suddenly spoke.

“Alright, fine. I really like gambling. And your proposal is quite interesting even in my short life of just a thousand years. I will accept it.”

He burst into laughter while stroking his beard. He laughed like that because he had won money.

“I will return this money to you.”

At that moment, a smile spread across my lips as well.

“Oh, you don't have to, but if you insist...”

“I didn't gamble for the money anyway. However, I think we need to have a deeper conversation.”

My hand, which was reaching for the coins, stopped. Right. The opponent was Eunsae Shibwol. I had let my guard down while having an open-hearted conversation with him, but it was not the time to worry about money.

“First question. You already knew my identity. How did you know?”

It was a common development in possession novels. The protagonist surprises the opponent by seeing through their identity. It would be nice to lie and say I figured it out with my insight, but that wouldn't work. Although he had divided all his power among three divine artifacts and was in a weakened state, his brainpower was still top-notch among the divine moons. A clumsy lie wouldn't work. So, I needed to come up with a plausible excuse...

“Enough.”

“...Pardon?”

“No need to ask. I am curious about your past. I will check it myself.”

“No, wait...”

I quickly tried to get up, fearing that the fact I was from 'Earth' might be exposed. But it was already too late.

“Calm down and relax.”

The moment I met his eyes... My strength drained from my body. Time and space completely stopped.

* * *

Splash.

Eunsae Shibwol threw himself into the sea. The sea of time. It was different from the waterfall of time. Here, it was impossible to resist or go against it. However, Eunsae Shibwol was special. He could swim freely in this sea of time.

‘...It's vast.’

From the moment he fell into the sea, the old man felt something strange. The very premise of a 'sea' was odd. If one were to briefly compare an individual's time, it could be likened to a 'stream.' Starting from a small stream, it gradually becomes a river, getting wider and deeper as it goes.

But this... What on earth is this?

Eunsae Shibwol had observed all times across countless eras over a thousand years. But even for him, this was a first. Such a vast amount of time, shattered into pieces...!

Baek Yuseol's time was not just enormous. This vast sea of time was fragmented like a kaleidoscope. Past and future were mixed, and Baek Yuseol was barely holding onto the thread of 'present'... living in this time zone. Unstable and incomplete. It wouldn't be surprising if he shattered into dust and disappeared at any moment.

‘How long has he lived...’

The time Eunsae Shibwol had lived for a thousand years seemed trivial compared to Baek Yuseol's clock, which was so old that it was a miracle it was still running.

‘That...’

A scene from a shattered future entered Eunsae Shibwol's sight. Ten years from now. The day when 'Heukya Shibsamwol' descends and the world is destroyed. It was a scene he had seen countless times since he was born... But the scene in Baek Yuseol's time was very different from what he knew.

‘Heukya Shibsamwol... is down.’

A being standing before the giant black dragon. He didn't need to try hard to understand who it was.

...Hwaak!!

The moment he confirmed it, Eunsae Shibwol's body was pulled back, and Baek Yuseol's journey to reach Heukya Shibsamwol flashed by in an instant. Hundreds, thousands of deaths and resurrections.

‘How?’

It was a sight even the old man couldn't understand. The Twelve Divine Moons, Eunsae Shibwol. He certainly had the ability to manipulate time. But because his power was so overwhelming and uncontrollable, he divided all his power equally among three divine artifacts. One governs the future. One governs the past. One governs the present. And he... was content to watch the past, present, and future all his life.

Time regression? He could do it if he wanted. He could go back as much as he wanted by turning the 'clockwork of the past.' But time regression was not perfect without a price. There was a restriction that 'events that happened in the future cannot be changed by going back to the past.' Even if he went back to the past because a loved one died, he would only witness the death scene again and couldn't prevent the death. Time regression? It was no different from a recorded video tape. He couldn't interfere with anything. He could only watch.

So, Eunsae Shibwol lived resignedly, knowing the world would end. Because the future couldn't be changed. But...

‘What are you?’

Baek Yuseol, who dared to challenge countless regressions that even he couldn't attempt, finally defeated Heukya Shibsamwol. A future he hadn't seen. A future he couldn't change. The boy in front of him... had achieved everything he thought he couldn't.

...Clunk!

“Hmm!”

Before he knew it, Eunsae Shibwol, who had come out of the sea and slumped into a chair, took out a bottle of dongdongju and brought it to his mouth.

“...Huh?”

Baek Yuseol looked around with a bewildered expression. It felt like time had stopped for a moment, but everything returned to normal in less than a second.

‘What...?’

As he fumbled around his chest and looked around, the Garam tribe guard and the dealer who was dealing the cards had bewildered expressions. They didn't understand the current situation.

“...Now that I see, we have met before.”

“Pardon?”

“Perhaps... we met sometime in the past.”

In another timeline. ‘What, what are you talking about?’ Baek Yuseol made a puzzled expression, but Eunsae Shibwol gulped down the dongdongju and spoke.

“I know why you came to me. You probably need my 'blessing.'”

I didn't expect the conversation to progress this far. ‘This wasn't part of the plan.’ Even if I won against Eunsae Shibwol in gambling and somehow charmed him with a cool line, his blessing was very expensive. I planned to visit him dozens or hundreds of times, becoming drinking buddies and gambling friends, and then bring up the topic of the blessing.

“Fine. I will give you my blessing. But with my current power, it's impossible to bestow a proper blessing. I have divided my power into four pieces and stored them in three divine artifacts.”

Baek Yuseol knew that. Unlike other divine moons who sealed a small portion of their power in divine artifacts, Eunsae Shibwol had poured too much power into his divine artifacts. As a result, the divine artifacts had reached the point where they could move and act on their own. Baek Yuseol didn't know their forms. Eunsae Shibwol's divine artifacts always had different appearances, races, ages, and genders, and they acted wherever they wanted. There were a few places I could roughly guess...

“Find one of the divine artifacts. Then, I will bestow my blessing upon you.”

“Pardon? Is that really true?”

“Is there any reason to hesitate? Knowing that your goal is the same as mine, I should help as much as I can.”

I didn't expect the conversation to go this smoothly. But there was one problem. How to find the divine artifacts. The divine artifact of Jeokharyuwol was carefully stored in the deepest part of the Adolevit Palace, the divine artifact of Cheongdong Shibiwol had frozen the coast of Levian, and the divine artifact of Yeonhong Chunsamwol was sleeping in an ancient ruin. All three had difficult levels of difficulty to obtain, but the common point was that they all stayed in one place without moving. But Eunsae Shibwol's blessing...

“Don't worry. You have already met one of my divine artifacts. And it seems to have quite a liking for you.”

“Met?”

“Yes. It must have been very recent, so try to recall. It will be staying by your side fatefully.”

“Oh...”

After saying that, Eunsae Shibwol stood up with the bottle of dongdongju. His face was slightly red as if he was a bit tipsy, but his pupils were unwavering.

“See you next time.”

* * *

The Starcloud Expedition of Jellyel, who successfully conquered the ancient ruins of Karmenset, returned amidst a barrage of cameras from numerous reporters. The story of Jellyel, who met the legendary 'Karmenset' and challenged him at the age of just eighteen, was enough to become a hot issue. Of course, it was also thanks to the Starcloud Merchant Group spreading the word in advance to boost Jellyel's image.

Click, click!

The reporters were shouting something outside the carriage, but Jellyel couldn't hear them at all.

‘Annoying.’

She let their voices flow in one ear and out the other. They were probably asking the obvious questions about how she found and conquered the ruins of Karmenset. She didn't need to answer here; she could explain everything properly at the press conference later. So, she didn't bother to listen to their words. More importantly, Jellyel was happier about the fact that she had given her father 'eternal life.'

At the last moment, Karmenset said, ‘Your wish has been granted!’ Immediately after, all the expedition members inside the ruins were expelled outside, and the door to the ruins was completely closed. It didn't matter anymore. She would never have to visit those ruins again. Extending her father's lifespan was enough to satisfy her.

‘But... what was that scene?’

However, there was one thing that bothered her. Why did the memory of her childhood come to mind at the moment she made her wish to Karmenset? The night when the moon rose. The memory of spending time with her father in a rented night amusement park... It was the only precious memory Jellyel cherished. Whenever and wherever she recalled it, it brought peace to her mind, a truly magical memory. Even now, thinking about it made her smile and feel happy.

‘Maybe... the joy of finally saving my father brought back the happiest memory of my childhood.’

Jellyel thought so and lay down in the carriage.

“...Miss.”

The driver of the automatic carriage turned around with a pale face.

“Are you really... okay?”

“Hmm, what?”

“Well, the reporters...”

Reporters? What about them? As she thought so and slightly listened, strange questions poured into her ears like waves.

“What do you think about the disappearance of the Starcloud Chairman?”

“There are testimonies that he suddenly vanished from the meeting hall!”

“Do you know anything about this?”

“Can you guarantee that it has nothing to do with you?”

“...Huh?”

It was a strange question. Why weren't they asking about Karmenset? Weren't they praising me? Jellyel turned her head towards the reporters with a blank expression. The faces of the reporters, who were enthusiastically shouting and spitting, seemed so slow and vivid. Why did their faces look so distorted and crumpled?

“What... is this?”

Jellyel shook her head, denying reality.

“Chairman Melian disappeared last night during the World Summit! Please say something!”

This moment was reality. And it was pain.
