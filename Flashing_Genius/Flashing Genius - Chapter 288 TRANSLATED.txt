A young girl with snow-white hair and bright, platinum-colored eyes like starlight floated through the azure sky. She sat astride a broom, her legs crossed, a classic witch's flying method. At 290 km/h, it was fast, but for her, who could teleport at will, this speed was merely a leisurely drive to feel the cool breeze. 

“Ugh, so boring!” she exclaimed, interrupting her flight on the broom. Her voice echoed as if from afar, for her body was not real but an illusion. “No matter how much I push my senses, I’m still limited to 20%.”

The White Witch, the Witch King, Scarlett, had ultimately failed to achieve the perfect body-splitting technique to create another physical form. To create a second body went against the world’s laws.

“Maybe I should raid a graveyard?” she muttered to herself. “I rejected the body-splitting technique that uses corpses to imbue with a soul because it was too vulgar for the Witch King. But I’m starting to regret it.”

“Well, I should be content with this.” She leaned back on the broom, crossing her legs. Her skirt rode up, exposing a dangerous amount of leg, but at this height, no pervert would be around to spy.

“The Witch King.” A telepathic voice pierced her ears, making her flinch.

“Aaah?!” Startled, Scarlett tumbled from the broom. A gray-haired man materialized in mid-air. 

“Enough with the pranks.” He said, halting Scarlett's fall as if she were hanging on a clothesline. She pouted, adjusting her skirt with her fingers, still in the awkward position of mid-fall. The broom flew back to her, supporting her backside.

“It wasn’t my fault for looking at a beautiful lady, was it?” She grumbled, climbing back on the broom and crossing her arms. She contorted her body in protest, but it was no use against the emotionless ‘Xin Yue’.

“So, why did you come?” She asked, leaning back against the broom. “You could’ve just come to my house, Xin Yue. I could’ve given you a warm welcome.”

The handsome man with long, gray hair and gray eyes, cold yet immaculate in appearance, ignored her playful banter. He snapped his fingers.

*Thwack!* A simple motion, yet the result was anything but simple. The azure sky began to turn a deep violet, as if a curtain had been drawn. Countless stars and galaxies started to appear, filling the void. 

Scarlett frowned, staring at the myriad of stars. Some flickered out, while others blazed with an explosive light. But strangely, not a single ‘born’ star was visible.

“It’s a lot different from last time,” she murmured, a wistful tone in her voice.

“The world is no longer being born.”

“Of course! We’re here, right?”

“…. That’s not right. Even if we are here, another ‘us’ should exist in another world.”

“You mean a parallel world? Ugh, I don’t believe in that stuff.”

“Don’t change the subject, Witch King.”

“Why? Serious topics aren’t fun. Can’t I rest? Hmm?”

Ignoring Scarlett’s attempt to avoid the conversation, Xin Yue pointed a finger at something. There, a star was falling, losing its light.

“Wow, it’s pretty, right?” she said, taking in the scene with apparent nonchalance.

“That’s the world where the Black Dragon was born. It collapsed in a flash.”

“Did you see it firsthand?” Her eyes shone with curiosity, but Xin Yue turned away, his eyes fixed on another point in the sky.

There…. countless stars were falling, like a downpour. It was far too grand to call it a meteor shower.

“Every world is dying.”

“Is that wrong?”

“No. It’s a natural progression for worlds to be born and die.”

“Then what’s the problem?”

“There are no new worlds being born. And...the world we stand on is not heading towards death.” His voice hardened, and he approached Scarlett, his gaze piercing.

“That’s the problem.”

“Oh, is it? I didn’t know.”

“Last night, a law related to this world’s death was broken. It involves you. What happened?”

“Ugh, it’s a lady’s secret.  You really need to know?”

“I didn’t think you’d be so easy to talk to.”

Xin Yue extended his palm, and the space around it began to warp. It was neither gray, black, nor white, but simply a chunk of space itself.

“Whoa? Are you trying to fight me?” Scarlett exclaimed, pointing at herself with a bewildered expression.

“Think again.”

“I’m getting scared now.” She wrapped her arms around herself, shaking her head dramatically, pretending to be terrified. Then, she suddenly opened her eyes and grinned.

“But guess what? This body’s fake!”

Xin Yue clenched his fist, twisting her body with all his might.

*Crack!* Her limbs were broken, her body shattered into dozens of pieces, yet a smile remained on Scarlett’s face.

“I told you! Come to my house. You and your fancy teleporting, right?” Her laughter, like that of a witch, filled the air as her body dissipated into a cloud of dust. 

Xin Yue stared at his hand, a grimace on his face. A ticket appeared, reading: “Come to my house or I’ll turn you into a frog!”

*Crunch, Snap!* The ticket crumbled under his hand, disintegrating into atoms. He was disappointed to have missed catching Scarlett, who had been teasing him the whole time, but… he hadn’t truly intended to capture her. The Witch King had been hiding her true form for centuries, so finding this clone was a blessing in disguise.

“Still… I learned something good.” Xin Yue muttered, gazing at the events unfolding on Earth, then turned away, disappearing into the depths of space.

The sky was still filled with hundreds, thousands of constellations in freefall. After all the stars extinguished, only one would remain.

***

As autumn approached, a small event in the school ignited a spark of excitement in the students' hearts. The annual Stella representative selection for the “League of Spirits” was about to begin.

While one might think of an inter-school competition as a small-scale affair, Stella was different. In the first place, students dedicated solely to the League of Spirits competed in separate leagues. These students formed clubs, and with nearly a thousand elite Stella magical warriors in each year, the competition was fierce. The scale was impressive, as even spectators paid for tickets just to watch the competition, and the audience numbers surpassed ten thousand, making it larger than most regional competitions.

With a cheerful grin, Full Flame submitted the application for his “Full Flame Team.” He had a lineup of Baek Yu-seol, Aizel, Ma Yu-seong, and Hae Won-ryang. There were no backup members, but five players were enough to carry the game.  It was safe to say they were a strong contender for the championship, even though they were a hastily assembled team.

There was one issue, however: most of the members had never experienced the League of Spirits. This meant they had to cram their training in the remaining two weeks before the tournament.

“Let’s see, how interested were they in the competition in the original novel?” Full Flame pondered. Baek Yu-seol didn’t even exist in the original, so he was out. Aizel was a cheat character with the traits of “All-Rounder” and “Multitalented,” capable of reaching pro-level skills after merely watching the League of Spirits for a short time, according to the original novel.  In fact, she participated in the tournament and won.  He still remembered the thrill of seeing her defeat the school’s Hyung Bi-yeon team and then win the world championship, even defeating Jelliel. The feeling of catharsis was so electric that he had replayed her winning moment over ten times. 

“Ma Yu-seong and Hae Won-ryang….?” The original novel didn’t mention if they participated in the tournament. The League of Spirits was a side story, and Aizel, along with various supporting characters, had formed teams with Feng Ha-rang, but main characters rarely appeared.

“Baek Yu-seol is a no-brainer.” She excelled at everything. Despite saying she never tried or wanted to play, she’d be the backbone of the team once the game started.

"Wow… The professor who received the application pushed up his glasses, shaking his head. "The members are intimidating.  This is going to be quite a spectacle. Even the Stella representative team will be nervous.” 

“Hey, we haven't trained professionally, so there’s no need to be nervous.  Pure magic warriors are different from professional players, you know.” Full Flame tried to sound humble, but someone from the side patted him on the shoulder. 

“That’s right.  Professional players and magic warriors are different.”

“Huh?” The pat wasn’t painful, but Full Flame found it irritating. He rubbed his arm and looked at the person who’d touched him.  The girl, who must have been at least 175 cm tall, towered over him, forcing him to look up. Her straight, neatly cut bangs hinted at a sharp personality. 

‘Gyu-rin…?’  He recognized the Stella uniform, but he’d never encountered her in school.  She was a minor character.  Full Flame remembered her name, not because she was famous, but because in the original novel, she was the first opponent Aizel defeated during her awakening. 

“You guys are pretty amazing as magic warriors.  But the arena will be different.  You think you can gather this team to win?  It’s hopeless, just give up.” 

Gyu-rin spat out these harsh words, then submitted her application and walked away. Her confident gait was impressive and even sexy, but her bad attitude made it hard to hide Full Flame’s annoyance. 

“What’s with her?”

“Heh, I’m sorry.  She’s just got a big ego, you know? She’s training to be a pro player.”

“Oh, right.”

Full Flame wasn’t annoyed because Gyu-rin had started a fight with him. It should’ve been Aizel, not him, who was on the receiving end of this. 

‘Ugh, sorry to Aizel.’ The original novel had changed so much that Aizel never had the chance to form a team.  The original storyline involved her participation in the tournament to escape the entanglement of Emperor Skalven and Princess Hong Bi-yeon. It was a story filled with determination, but now it was gone. Even looking at Aizel, who was still studying in her private room despite the imminent tournament, showed how peaceful and stable her life had become.

“You see, Spirit players are often looked down upon by magic warriors. They're always on edge because of it.  And to make things worse, you guys aren’t training at all.  So she probably thinks you’re disrespecting the competition."

It was true. There were even rumors that those who couldn’t handle the life of a magic warrior ran away to the League of Spirits. 

But Full Flame didn't disrespect them. He formed the team to escape Skalven, that bastard, so why would he have any reason to disrespect them? 

“Sports are sports, and combat is combat.  There’s nothing to disrespect.” 

“It would be great if every magician had your same mindset, but take your application and get going. You’ll have access to the League of Spirits training grounds from now on.  You’ll have the chance to train, but it’s going to be a short time.  Give it your all.” 

“Sure, we will.”

Two weeks? A day would be enough.
