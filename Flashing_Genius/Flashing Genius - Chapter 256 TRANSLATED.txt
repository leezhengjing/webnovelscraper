I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 256

50. Noble Soul (6)

The Garden of the Millennial Spirit, Yiphanel.

Was it the beginning of the semester when I first came here? At that time, I still didn't fully understand the concept of mana leakage delay. Mana leakage delay. Thinking about it, she was probably the one who helped me the most. Not anyone else, but she helped me understand the secret of my body, and thanks to that, I overcame my terminal condition. There were many ways to do it without Yiphanel, but... Honestly, I wasn't sure if I could have done it before graduating from Stella, so I am always grateful to her. However, I never had the opportunity to express that gratitude. Our meeting was brief, and even after waking up, I kept sleeping and couldn't have a proper conversation with her. As the distance grew, so did our hearts... Honestly, I had completely forgotten about her until now. If I had to make an excuse, I was really busy. So busy that I didn't have a moment to rest throughout the summer vacation, even traveling through time. ...Even so, Yiphanel had just woken up and was very fragile and vulnerable, so I should have taken an interest and checked on her often. The story development was completely different from the original game.

"The concentration of mana... is gradually sinking."

I nodded at Kkotseorin's words. Ordinary people wouldn't feel it, but we, who are sensitive to mana, could vaguely sense that something was wrong. The path to Yiphanel's garden was not a road paved for ordinary people to walk on; it was a completely rugged terrain. It was very difficult to walk alone, but with Kkotseorin, the burden was lessened.

Srrrk...

When she walked, paths appeared where there were none, leaves that blocked the view moved aside on their own, and petals from the sky created stepping stones. Some might find the scene beautiful, mysterious, or enchanting, but honestly, I just found it convenient. It would be nice if I had such an ability...

When we finally reached our destination, Kkotseorin stopped, and the petals and branches that had gathered to help her retreated.

"...I don't feel good about this."

The entrance to the garden was entwined with the branches of the World Tree, making it undetectable to ordinary elves. However, with a gesture from Kkotseorin, the vines parted, revealing an old moss-covered stone monument. That was the entrance to the garden. I stepped forward and took out the key to the garden.

"That is..."

"I received it as a gift before."

"A key as a gift...?"

"Yes."

The person who gave it to me was from the Constellation Project, but it wasn't a lie. Click! When I placed the key against the stone, it slid aside, revealing a pure white light. The place where Yiphanel resided was slightly out of the three-dimensional reality, so the space itself was slightly distorted in that way. After exchanging a glance with Kkotseorin, I took a deep breath and stepped inside.

Wooong!!

After the familiar sensation of the space flipping quickly passed, I opened my eyes to see the garden, entirely dyed in purple.

"Ugh!"

Feeling dizzy for a moment, I quickly reached into the subspace and took out a mask. This mask, modeled after a gas mask, helped block the turbid mana instead of toxic gas. Knowing that my body was very vulnerable to mana with intense colors, I had made it, but I never thought I would use it in Yiphanel's garden.

"This is...‚Äù

Following me into the garden, Kkotseorin looked around the interior with a shocked expression. The garden, originally filled with a green aura and a beautiful, mysterious place, was now contaminated with a powerful purple miasma. Even with the gas mask on, it was hard to breathe properly. I should ask Alterisha to upgrade its performance.

"Are you okay?"

"Yes... somehow. Rather, I want to ask you."

"Yes?"

Kkotseorin's complexion was pale. Her lips trembled, and her pupils shook without stopping, indicating her poor condition. Because of the contamination of dark mana? No, that can't be. She, blessed by the World Tree, wouldn't be harmed by this level of dark mana. Kkotseorin was now... panicking at the unbelievable situation of feeling dark mana in Yiphanel's garden. Surprisingly, thanks to the blessing of Yeonhongchunsamwol, she almost didn't show it outwardly, so I almost missed it.

"Calm down."

"Ah..."

I held her hands tightly with both of mine and said,

"We don't know what's happening inside yet."

She bit her lips and looked at me with trembling eyes, then closed her eyes tightly.

"Yes. Let's go quickly."

Even though the garden was contaminated with dark mana, nothing had changed. Previously, I had hunted plant-type monsters here, but they were all golems that Yiphanel had scattered to protect herself, so they were not visible now. Ironically, it felt more like a dungeon now, with no monsters at all. It's ironic. Carefully, I walked with Kkotseorin for a long time until we reached the end of the garden, where a large rock wall blocked the way. It wasn't there before... Seeing Kkotseorin approach it familiarly, it seemed it was only absent when I came.

"This is... a barrier Yiphanel sets up when she doesn't want to let outsiders in."

"A barrier?"

It looked like an ordinary rock. Fortunately, Kkotseorin seemed to know the password, as she placed her palm on the barrier and chanted a spell.

Wooong!!

Red, blue, and yellow circular magic circles spread out like waves in the air, and the rock wall began to slide aside with a loud noise. Soon, the wind brushed my cheeks, and moonlight poured down. It was a beautiful sight, even seeing it again. In the open sky, there were three moons larger than Earth's moon, and the silver-colored Milky Way crossing the sky filled the flower field abundantly. Under the vast flower field where the moonlight poured down, she was there. The Millennial Spirit, Yiphanel. Trapped in time that had stopped forever, she had gained a new heart and was given a new life... She was still frozen with her eyes closed. In the same posture I remembered from that time. A girl kneeling with her hands clasped as if in prayer. Although she was a woman back then, her appearance had become younger, and she had a sad expression on her face.

"Yiphanel..."

Originally, Yiphanel, who had a cold and icy blue color like moonlight, was now dyed in purple, as if someone had deliberately contaminated her with dark mana. Kkotseorin covered her mouth with a complicated expression, but I remained calm and thought.

'Why?'

Why did they suddenly dye Yiphanel in black? As far as I know... about a year from now, the 'Dark Mana War' is supposed to take place. At that time, Yiphanel happens to be tainted with dark mana... but it was never revealed why or who tainted her. Players speculated that it was to brainwash Kkotseorin with dark mana and use her as a pawn in the Dark Mana War. However, the Dark Mana War is still a long way off... and it's questionable if it will even happen. Because... the Dark Mana War only occurs in the route where Mayuseong falls.

"This doesn't make sense."

"...What?"

At that moment, Kkotseorin shook her head and spoke.

"It's impossible to taint a spirit with dark mana."

"If the concentration is this thick... Yiphanel might not have been able to endure it. Besides, she's weakened now."

"That's not what I mean."

"What?"

She spoke with a firm expression.

"Yiphanel is a spirit. The moment she ascended to a spirit... she gained the qualification of a 'noble soul' that cannot be corrupted by anything in the world."

"Ah."

For a moment, it felt like someone hit my head with a hammer. It was a question I had never considered before. A noble soul does not fall to dark mana, and a spirit's soul is always noble. The reason I had always overlooked this simple premise was obvious... because in the original game, the route where Yiphanel falls was surprisingly common. But I don't know the cause. I just played the story because it existed, and I repeatedly went to the dungeon to fight Yiphanel as the episode directed. Without even trying to think about what made her that way.

'How did they corrupt a noble soul? Was there a villain capable of that?'

Everything is full of questions.

"Sigh..."

I don't know the cause, and I don't know the culprit. I slowly approached Yiphanel. She still had her eyes tightly closed, clasping her hands to her chest, and her expression looked as if she was terrified of something, making my heart ache even more.

"I should have come sooner..."

She couldn't hear my voice. The small scream that had been lingering in my ears was no longer heard. What I thought was a hallucination was actually Yiphanel's cry for help.

'...Wait a minute. Then she was at least sane until a week ago.'

Is it possible to be completely contaminated in such a short time? No matter how powerful the Dark Mana King is, it's impossible to contaminate a spirit to this extent. I quickly looked around. The dark mana, completely dyed in purple. Now that I see it... the green mana that Yiphanel originally had was not even a trace. Only the purple mana remained. And the purple mana spread throughout this space... as if it had been here for hundreds of years, naturally blending into the environment.

"This, could it be..."

Feeling something was wrong, I was about to say something to Kkotseorin when she suddenly staggered and knelt on the ground.

"What's wrong? Are you okay?"

I hurriedly supported her, and Kkotseorin, holding her throbbing head, broke out in a cold sweat and said,

"...Yes. I'm okay."

"Suddenly... is it because of the dark mana?"

"That's... not it... The World Tree keeps talking to me..."

"What is it saying?"

Kkotseorin shook her head and slowly parted her pink lips.

"A visitor with a dark brown aura has arrived..."

"Dark brown...?"

The unfamiliar yet familiar word made my mind go blank for a moment, but soon my glasses automatically searched and displayed information in front of my eyes. Immediately, I felt my chest turn cold.

'No way...'

There are only two beings in this world with such a unique aura. One of them never moves, so the remaining one is...

'Cheolriban.'

It can only be that legendary dark mage.
