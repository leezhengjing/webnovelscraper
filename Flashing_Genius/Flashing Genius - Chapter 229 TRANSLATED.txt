### Chapter 229: The Start of the Semester (3)

After the future genius magitech engineer, Lakan, joined the Alchemy Castle, its technology advanced at a blinding speed. However, such an unbelievable, novel-like story did not happen immediately. Lakan had just taken his first steps in magitech. Of course, thanks to his genius, his presence would become evident within half a year to a year, but for now, he was still in the learning phase.

"Here, you said you needed this, right?" 

Altherisha, in a good mood after recruiting an excellent magitech engineer, handed me a large, pure white orb with a beaming smile. Its original name was 'Force Vessel.' It was an item that could only be crafted by mages who dealt with thought forms, making it impossible to produce with modern magical technology. It was a trophy obtained at the beginning of the semester after piercing the heart of a necromancer. At that time, due to a lack of technical skills, we couldn't properly utilize this precious item, but now things were different.

**[Temporary Subspace Pocket]**

Altherisha's alchemical magitech had developed enough to create a subspace pocket, also known as an 'inventory,' through it. Although I still used an expanded space backpack, no matter how much the weight was reduced, it was still a burden for someone like me, whose life depended on agility. It was also quite cumbersome during close combat. However, using the inventory would make everything much more convenient. Even in places where carrying a backpack was not allowed, I could freely use the subspace.

"You're going to create a subspace with this?" 

Altherisha's sparkling pink eyes shone with curiosity. Whenever she discovered something new, she always had that innocent, childlike expression.

"That's the plan, for now."

"That's amazing... Subspace is the exclusive domain of high-level spatial mages."

"Honestly, it's not as impressive as being compared to those mages."

"Still, it's remarkable to use subspace without being a spatial mage."

That was true. However, to use subspace, one had to obtain a Force Vessel from a thought-form mage and then get a 'Dimension Enchant' from a spatial magitech engineer, which was a very troublesome process. The two processes were extremely difficult, and on top of that, an alchemical magitech engineer with advanced skills was also needed, making it quite challenging for an ordinary mage to acquire.

"By the way, will you be returning to Stella from the second semester?"

"Well... originally, Altherisha's job was as an assistant in the alchemy department at Stella Academy, specifically, Professor Maizen's assistant. However, after Professor Maizen disappeared and Altherisha announced her magitech, she naturally became more involved with the Alchemy Castle, distancing herself from Stella. This development was also in the original game, so I had expected it, but Altherisha looked genuinely apologetic.

"I'm sorry. I want to continue going to school, but it seems I'll be working at the Alchemy Castle from now on."

"That's great. You can achieve your dreams here."

"...Actually, I feel like I've already achieved them."

Altherisha said with a smile and then hurriedly brought a box from the corner of the office, as if she had just remembered. She had a habit of stacking important items in a box and placing them within easy reach, and it seemed she was about to give me a gift. As expected, Altherisha proudly took out bracelets, piercings, or daggers and pieces of cloth.

"This is a gift!"

"Oh... wait a minute."

After examining them with my 'Sparrowhawk Glasses,' I found that their performance was indeed something to boast about. Each item wasn't overwhelmingly powerful enough to turn the tide of battle, but they were sufficient to make unfavorable fights more manageable. Items were generally used for such purposes. They didn't contain overpowered magic that could wipe out enemies with a single swing of a staff. Only when the user possessed strong power and knowledge did these 'items' truly shine.

"The items I gave you last time were so incomplete that it was embarrassing to call them finished products... but this time, they will definitely be helpful."

"Thank you."

As I gathered the items, Altherisha hesitated for a moment before quietly speaking.

"These days... I've been busy, but... I've been reading a lot of newspapers and..."

"Yes?"

"I've also made a lot of connections, so I sometimes hear news or stories that ordinary people don't."

"Oh..."

She seemed hesitant, then smiled cautiously, filled with concern.

"I hear stories about you from here and there. I don't know what you're up to, but be careful. And... if you have time, visit the Alchemy Castle often. I might not be able to return to Stella anymore."

"You are the person with whom I shared the most precious time."

I didn't expect her to say that. Well, Altherisha was the first person I got close to, writing papers, studying, and presenting at conferences together since the beginning of the semester. Besides... honestly, I felt closer to Altherisha because she was the same age as my real self. So I treated her very comfortably and opened up to her. But now, with time becoming increasingly scarce, I couldn't visit her properly, so it was natural for her to feel a bit disappointed.

"...Oh my. What am I saying?"

Altherisha blushed and quickly put on her gown.

"I have a meeting to attend! See you next time!"

Bang!

As I watched Altherisha leave, slamming the door loudly, I couldn't help but laugh helplessly. I never thought she was such an honest person, but it felt like I had discovered a new side of her.

Returning to Stella, I headed straight to the principal's office. In Aither World Online, Stella Academy was sometimes depicted as a small country or a massive magic tower, making it very difficult for an ordinary student to meet the principal for a consultation. However, I had made an appointment in advance, so there was no problem.

The First Main Tower. At the top of this enormous tower, where all of Stella Academy's core forces gathered, there was a space reserved exclusively for the principal. Even in terms of area, it easily exceeded 100 pyeong (approximately 330 square meters), but thanks to Elteman Eltewin's unique space expansion magic, the internal scale of the main tower itself was expanded, making it feel almost as large as a playground. Depending on Elteman's mood, the size could shrink or expand, so I heard a joke somewhere that the cleaners had a hard time every day.

"It's been a while since we had a consultation. Did you have a good summer vacation?"

Elteman asked with a smile, handing me a cup of 'Rilt Tea.' I had no idea what kind of taste that foul-smelling, strange tea had, but since it was given by the principal, I accepted it.

"Yes, well... it was a fulfilling vacation."

"Yes, it seems so. In that short time, two more stars have appeared in your eyes."

"...Excuse me?"

Did I have glow-in-the-dark star stickers on my eyes or something?

"So, you requested this consultation... does that mean you're finally ready?"

Elteman's face was full of curiosity, and since he looked like a teenager, he gave off the impression of a child eagerly waiting for Christmas presents. Though his true nature was probably much darker.

"Here it is."

When I handed over the [Temporary Subspace Pocket], Altherisha's masterpiece, Elteman examined it with a flushed face.

"Wow... this is amazing. Imprinting space onto the soul, huh? Yes, this should definitely be possible."

No matter how much a mage reached the pinnacle of magic at the 9th class, they ultimately couldn't reach the end. In fact, it was said that upon becoming a 9th class mage, they realized that there was more they didn't know than they did. Other mages might claim to understand most of the world's principles after mastering 7 to 8 levels of magic within a limited world of 10. However, upon reaching the 9th class, they realized a world of 100 or even 1,000, making them feel infinitely insignificant. Therefore, historically, 9th class archmages often experienced what was called 'Sage Time,' leading them to abandon all worldly matters and retreat to secluded places to study all day. Principals like Stella's or the tower lords of the Crescent Moon Tower and Full Moon Tower, who were socially active, were rather unique cases.

"Alright. We can start right away."

"Really?"

"Yes. But as you know, this... is going to hurt a lot."

"Uh..."

I knew. In Aither World Online, when a character imprinted a subspace, there was a scene where they screamed, and most of their health was drained. Even the mentally strong protagonists screamed, so I couldn't even imagine how painful it would be. However, I decided to trust in the blessing of Yeonhongchunsamwol and my mental strength.

"It's fine. Please start right away."

"Good choice. I've been itching to try it too. Take off your top and lie down here."

I swallowed hard and lay down on the bed as Elteman instructed. It would hurt terribly, but... surely, I wouldn't die, right?

As the sun set, the streets of Arcanium were filled with blooming youth. While 'magic warrior cadets' from the five prestigious magic schools in Arcanium were required to live in dormitories on campus, it wasn't mandatory for other magic students. Most of them found cheap accommodations in Arcanium or the satellite city and commuted to school. Those students were probably ordinary students like that. They gathered in groups, chatting and heading somewhere. And...

In the middle of the road where those students were coming and going, someone stood still, watching them. Dressed in a completely black robe with their face almost invisible, they exuded a creepy atmosphere. Yet, for some reason, none of the students noticed their presence.

Thud!

"Huh?"

Someone bumped into their shoulder.

"What's wrong?" a friend asked.

"Uh... I don't know. Let's go!"

However, the student who bumped into them soon forgot about it and continued on their way with their friend. The black-robed figure narrowed their red eyes, watching the students one by one, and exhaled a white breath.

-...She's not here either, the witch.

They had obtained information that there was definitely a 'witch' here, but for some reason, they couldn't sense any trace of her anywhere. 

-Another wild goose chase...

The black-robed figure soon turned into mist and dispersed into the air, leaving nothing behind. Meanwhile, the students continued to wander the streets, unaware of anything.

"...Hmm."

And, from between the alleys, someone was secretly watching the black-robed figure. Mayuseong peeked out, his head tilted.

"Interesting guy..."

He stood there for a while, watching the spot where the black-robed figure had been, with a smile on his face. However, his actions couldn't last long. Unlike the black-robed figure, Mayuseong was too conspicuous.

"Hey, isn't that Mayuseong?"

"He looks even better in person."

"Wait a minute. I need to take out my eyes and clean them to see properly."

As students began to gather, Mayuseong awkwardly smiled and quickly left the scene.

'I hate witches...'

He had a bad feeling that something unpleasant was going to happen in Arcanium, making him feel uneasy.
