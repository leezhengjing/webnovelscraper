### The Genius Who Became a Blink Mage at the Magic Academy

#### Chapter 215: Old Stories (11)

The twelve disciples of the progenitor mage, the descendants of the great Morpheus, and the 8th-class mage, Grand Duke Isaac Morpheus. His loyal aide, Wilhelm, was known for his highly businesslike and honest personality. In fact, to put it nicely, he was straightforward, but to put it bluntly, he was inflexible and rigid.

"……This way."

Wilhelm, with a face full of dissatisfaction, guided me to my private quarters. It was impossible for a mere escort to use the same grand mansion as Lady Angel, so I was assigned to an external dormitory, which seemed to be a high-grade accommodation only accessible to someone of the rank of a knight commander.

'Your Highness! This is unbelievable! Entrusting the lady's escort to an outsider and granting such a status……!'

I still remember when Grand Duke Isaac introduced me to Wilhelm. His vehement opposition, foaming at the mouth, was a testament to his firm beliefs, which was admirable, but from my perspective, it was quite awkward. Nevertheless, Wilhelm was relatively normal. Who would agree to suddenly appoint an outsider as Lady Angel's 'personal escort'? Honestly, I was also very surprised when I first received the request.

However, most people kept their mouths shut because it was the Grand Duke's decision. Only the loyal Wilhelm opposed it vehemently. Although he did not show me any favor, he was undoubtedly a loyalist, so I did not have a bad impression of him.

"Yes. It's a nice room. I'll use it well."

Wilhelm glared at me for a long time before speaking.

"That mask."

"……Yes?"

"It's highly suspicious."

What does he want me to do? Even if he says that, I can't take off the mask. Grand Duke Isaac allowed it, so Wilhelm can't order me to remove it. Besides, the mask is a trademark symbolizing hidden power. Although I don't have any hidden power……

"Fine."

When I didn't move, Wilhelm turned around and spoke quietly.

"I warn you, do not put the lady in danger. I will not forgive you."

Then he disappeared with quiet steps. He's not a bad person, but…… he feels like someone who would be difficult to get close to.

"Sigh……."

I collapsed onto the bed, which was of much better quality than the one in Stella Academy's S-class dormitory, and stared blankly at the ceiling, organizing my thoughts.

"The rules of a time traveler…… The most powerful rule, which can also be called a dilemma. Never change the 'definite events' that happened in the past. If [Tonight, Angel eats strawberry cake] is a confirmed fact in history, and I change history so that she can't eat the strawberry cake, the future will change drastically. There's a 0.00001% chance that Angel, who couldn't eat the strawberry cake, might suddenly run away from home. What happens then? When I return to the present…… it will be a completely different future, a different world. Angel might not have enrolled in Stella, Flame might not exist, and the world might be completely dominated by the Dark Demon Sect. In short, a storyline that didn't even appear in the original game might suddenly emerge. And that world…… will not be the 'my world' that I know and love. They might not remember me, or it might be a world where I don't exist. From now on, while living here, I must not change any future. Fortunately, there are very few confirmed events. The story of the Morpheus Grand Duchy during this period is hardly recorded. Even if Angel wrote a diary, as a time traveler, I haven't seen it, so the contents of the diary are not confirmed history. All 'confirmed events' are determined by the knowledge of the time traveler, the observer. The only confirmed history I know is the 'betrayal and death of Grand Duke Morpheus.' That's the only fact. Ironically, the history I most want to change is the one I can't change. This situation is truly ironic. The word fits my situation so well that I laughed bitterly.

"Sigh, I don't know."

Living by Angel's side is unsettling, but if I live as quietly as possible, the future won't change. So, let's live quietly, like a mouse. Until I return.

* * *

……My determination to live quietly was shattered in just one night.

The Morpheus Grand Duchy. The Blue Mane Knights' training ground.

"I heard you are Lady Angel's new escort knight."

"Yes…… Although I'm called a knight, I mainly use a staff as a symbol, not a sword. I've never properly used a sword, so it's laughable to see me carrying one for show."

"……The previous escort knight was responsible for His Highness's childhood and protected Lady Angel until recently. Although he couldn't overcome his illness and passed away, we all remember him."

I didn't expect such a story.

"But! For an unknown wanderer like you to take his place…… His Highness may have acknowledged you, but we cannot!"

Thud! Carmen, the passionate captain of the Blue Mane Knights' 3rd assault squad, pointed his wand at me and shouted loudly for everyone to hear.

"I can't drag you down, but I will test your skills!"

Whoosh! Carmen's glove flew towards me. Is this the duel challenge I've heard about? Thanks to my heightened sensory abilities, the flying glove seemed so slow that I had time to think about many things. Should I accept it or not? Honestly, with the blessing of Silver November, defeating Carmen is not a problem. The important thing is the perception. Is it okay to wield a sword in front of Angel? As far as I know, future Angel first learned about the unique combat style of swordsmanship and blinking when she met me ten years later. But if my past self suddenly demonstrates blinking…… history will change. That can't happen.

Whoosh! I sidestepped, and Carmen's glove flew past me and fell to the ground.

"What are you doing?"

"I'm not a knight, so I don't accept duels."

"Ha, nonsense. You are an escort knight…."

"I'm not a knight, but a personal escort. Should I show you the contract? I was hired as a mercenary, and my role is different from a knight in that I use any means and methods. Don't think of me as the same as you."

I coolly turned around. ……And I was a little scared. Even here, the burly knights were glaring at me with terrifying eyes. If I wasn't scared, would I still be human? But I used the blessing of Spring March to speak as calmly as possible.

"I have no intention of fitting into your knight culture."

"That bastard……!"

"How dare he insult a knight!"

After saying that, I turned around and heard the knights cursing at me, but most of it was ignorable, so I ignored it.

"Cowardly bastard."

I must ignore it.

"He must be running away because he has no skills. I understand."

I tried to ignore it.

"A wandering mercenary, I wonder if he's ever fought a magic battle."

……But my pride was slightly hurt, so I turned around and spoke to Carmen.

"A duel? I just need to defeat you, right?"

When I fell for his low-level provocation, his lips curled into a smile.

"Yes. If you're confident in your skills, take out your staff and face me proudly!"

A staff. My main weapon is a sword, and the only magic I can use is blinking. In other words, as long as I don't show the sword and blinking, it should be fine, right? Approaching the staff rack, I found a decent silver staff of appropriate length. It seemed to be a common one used by the knights, with a suitable weight and strength.

"Hmm, I'll use this."

"You're using a staff. Are you a bishop?"

"Yes…… let's say that."

Technically, I'm in the knight position, but since I'm using a staff now, there's no need to correct him.

"The duel will begin."

A knight stood in the center to mediate our duel.

"Both sides, salute."

Salutes vary by country. The Morpheus Grand Duchy's salute involves raising the staff with the right hand towards the left shoulder. I almost did Stella's salute out of habit but awkwardly followed Morpheus's salute, which was apparently lacking, as laughter erupted.

"Begin the duel!"

As the duel began, a red magic circle started to glow in front of Carmen. Carmen's position is a knight. A type that focuses on close combat, thinking I am a bishop who focuses on long-range combat, so probably……

"Hah!"

He will charge. That judgment wasn't wrong, but unfortunately, I am completely ineffective in long-range combat despite holding a staff. On the contrary, in close combat…… I am more confident.

Thwack!!

My action was simple. As Carmen charged with flames in both hands, I struck his head with the staff.

"Ugh!"

A short scream came out as the shield protecting his body shattered. Although it's not a Terrifon sword, my current level is equivalent to a 7th-class mage. Breaking Carmen's shield, estimated to be around 5th-class, was enough.

"What, what is this……?"

Carmen, who fell to the ground in an unsightly manner, quickly rolled back and swiftly deployed a magic circle in front of him, but I rushed in and shattered it with the staff, then struck his head again.

Thwack!!

This time, it was a proper hit. The shield was broken. Thwack! Crack! Thwack! Crack! Thwack! The shield regenerated quickly, showing his considerable combat sense, but it was no match for me with the blessing of Silver November. If he creates a shield, I break it again. If he creates another, I break it again.

"Ugh! Gah! Agh! Stop!"

I swung and swung again. Honestly…… this was more like a beating than a magic duel. I didn't use any magic, just mechanically swung the staff, while Carmen curled up to avoid getting hit as much as possible.

"Crazy!"

"What kind of duel is this……!"

"He's a vicious guy…… He's deliberately hitting the same spot again……"

"No, if you look closely, he's hitting everywhere evenly…… but then hitting the same spot again……"

"He's a devil!"

"Hahaha."

Receiving the knights' exclamations(?), I happily beat Carmen. Evening came.

"……I heard you beat one of my knights."

A meeting with Grand Duke Morpheus. It wasn't too unpleasant. After all, I was at fault, but they started the trouble first.

"There was a reason."

"Tell me."

"I was curious if dust would come out if I beat someone like a dog on a rainy day."

"Haha."

Grand Duke Isaac laughed and nodded.

"So, did dust come out?"

"No, it didn't. I guess I didn't beat him enough."

"I see."

He answered and then fell silent for a moment before speaking quietly.

"Perhaps some knights who don't like you picked a fight. They might have insulted you first. You could have told me…… but you didn't, to protect my knights from me?"

That wasn't my intention…… I just like making jokes.

"I see you in a new light. You have deep thoughts and consideration. If only you were truly my knight……."

"No, thank you."

"Haha. Anyway, I didn't call you to scold you. Injuries during a duel are common, aren't they?"

"Then……"

"I called you because I want to take you with me on tomorrow's mission."

He handed me a document. Honestly, even after reading it properly, I didn't understand it, but something stood out.

'Adolevit Royal Seal'

"This is……!"

"You recognize it. The royal seal is not something an ordinary person can see."

"Is this a cooperation request from the Adolevit Royal Family?"

"Yes. It's nothing major, but they requested access to the Morpheus Forest where we first met. As you know, the Morpheus territory borders the Adolevit Kingdom."

"That's right."

"They claimed that the magical beasts in the Morpheus Forest are about to awaken. It's not wrong from a magical standpoint. I was convinced. But……."

Grand Duke Isaac took off his monocle and massaged his temples as if he had a headache.

"I wonder if there's a need to forcibly invade our territory to hunt magical beasts."

I read the document again. It was written in a polite and bold font, but it was filled with phrases that could be considered international threats. Although this wouldn't shake the Morpheus territory, he seemed to want to avoid unnecessary friction. Or

"If we don't allow it, they seem ready to start a war."

"……They're crazy."

"Yes. The current commander of the operation is a seventeen-year-old girl named 'Hong Si-hwa.' Although her magical level is not high, she is said to be a genius in strategy and command."

But it's still strange.

"Why is Adolevit so obsessed with the magical beasts in the Morpheus Forest?"

Isaac Morpheus didn't answer. He just smiled bitterly and continued.

"I had no choice but to allow it. Of course, since it's my territory, I set the condition that my knights and I would be present at the operation site. They didn't refuse that."

"I see……."

"So, I want to ask you. Are you interested in this mission?"

That was the main point. Taking me, whose abilities had been verified, on the mission. Although I don't doubt Grand Duke Isaac's character…… I suddenly thought that the duel with Carmen might have been his intention.

"Well…… Is it right for me to get involved in such an important event? Moreover, it's an unknown event not even recorded in history. Then I thought again, maybe it's advantageous for me because it's an unknown event. If it's an unknown event, whatever happens there won't affect the future at all. Rather, it's a good thing. I wanted to know more about the mystery of Grand Duke Isaac's betrayal.

"Yes. I'll go."

"I like your confident answer."

And so…… I became deeply involved in a major event between the Morpheus Grand Duchy and the Adolevit Royal Family. Even now, I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do.
