### I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy's Frontline Teleportation

#### Chapter 151: Magic Survival (3)

"Hmm... After using the Scanning Field, I hid in the corner of a ruined building and checked the map. Only one participant was marked. Despite being detected by the Scanning Field, they remained motionless, standing still... It seems they were attacked by Berenkal. As expected of the strategies written by veterans. They had memorized the exact timing and location of Berenkal's first kill and documented it. 

Anyway, the fact that their location is marked on the map means they are still alive. Later, other participants will approach them and deliberately deplete their life force, causing them to be automatically eliminated and return to the outside. Additionally, the person who witnessed the incident will realize that someone with suspicious power exists in this field. 

After a while, the map indicator turned off, and the survivor status changed. Someone must have found the victim and properly eliminated them. For now, I felt a bit relieved. 

"Phew..."

Leaning against a pillar of the collapsed building, I tried to put the used Scanning Field back into my survival backpack when I sensed a presence with my 'sixth sense.' The location was right outside the building wall. Someone was approaching by climbing the building. 

'Well, it would be strange if I hadn't been detected.'

In my haste to quickly farm the Scanning Field, I had left clear traces, including footprints. Additionally, my location was exposed to other participants hiding nearby. Although the distance to the center was still far, a battle was inevitable at this point. I took out the weapon I had just picked up along with the Scanning Field from my backpack. It looked unimpressive, but it was quite a powerful weapon within the Magic Survival. It was a secondary weapon meant to be wielded in emergencies, and only a few eccentrics carried it around. 

...It's sad that I have to be one of those eccentrics. 

Anyway, from now on, things are going to get quite noisy. As I quietly approached the gaping window, the presence became more distinct. The enemy outside the window seemed to have trained in high-level mana control, as I could barely sense the flow of mana despite them clinging to the building wall. They were likely of the Knight class. 

But that wasn't a problem. I was confident in close combat. 

[Teleport]

...Hup!

Using teleportation to escape through the window and float in the air, I saw the face of the boy clinging to the wall filled with bewilderment. He seemed to be trying to take out his wand to prepare a spell, but I already knew that casting magic while clinging to a wall would be slow. 

[Teleport]

I teleported again to approach and swung the wooden club hard. 

Thwack!!

"Argh!"

The boy, who hastily deployed a shield, couldn't withstand the impact and fell to the ground. If we had fought on flat ground, it would have been a tough battle, but his mistake was trying to ambush me while clinging to the wall. 

Thud...!

I quickly ran down the wall towards the fallen boy and finished him off by swinging the wooden club. The cheerful killing sound indicating the enemy's elimination echoed in my ears. 

"Phew."

I had dealt with the immediate threat, but this was just the beginning. I planned to attack every enemy I encountered from now on. 

'I hope I don't end up dying a pointless death...'

Hoping not to encounter an opponent as strong as a championship contender, I headed towards the city center. 

Magic Survival is the most anticipated event for spectators. It's a place where the most talented boys and girls gather to determine the last one standing. Strategy, tactics, magic, luck, terrain, weatherâ€”all these elements come together to finally produce the last survivor. 

Moreover, the question of 'which school is superior' is a daily topic among wizards, so Magic Survival, where over thirty prestigious schools gather for a survival game, often extends into a battle of pride. It had become so common for kings to personally attend and occupy the best VIP seats to see how excellent their country's students were that it was impossible to easily stop Magic Survival. 

"...If we stop it now, there will be a huge uproar."

That was the opinion of Eltman Eltwin. 

"Recent inter-school competitions are no longer at the level of a simple school festival. You know that too, Flame."

"I know, but..."

Flame, who had come to the principal's office of the First Main Tower, hung his head low and bit his lip. Eltman looked through the file with a regretful expression. 

"Even so... I was in the process of ferreting out the rat. It's certain that a black magician with the qualifications to access the heart of the Stella Dome has infiltrated... but with current technology, it's impossible to find them."

Eltman Eltwin, a 9th-class magician and one of the ten great sages in the world. Flame knew better than anyone how much Eltman's pride was hurt. In the original novel, Eltman had tried so hard to detect the black magician's power that he had nosebleeds. He must be feeling quite troubled now. 

"...Of course, I don't intend to do nothing. We need to take action."

Even if they cast a spell to bring the students out of the isolated space right now, it would take a considerable amount of time. By then, a significant number of casualties would have already occurred. In that case, wouldn't it be better to secretly help one of the participants in the survival game to eliminate the black magician separately?

"But... we don't even know who the black magician is. And even if we help, who should we help..."

"Baek Yuseol. I plan to help that child."

"What...?"

Flame's eyes widened in surprise at the unexpected name. 

"Well, the students from other schools are also elites. They must have considerable practical experience. But I trust my school's students."

There were many participants among the second and third-year students of Stella, but Eltman specifically mentioned and trusted the first-year student Baek Yuseol the most. 

"That child... as you know, is special."

Eltman said, looking at Anella, who was hiding behind Flame and fidgeting with her fingers. 

'A transfer student...'

Her gaze was suspicious, but even using mana scan, there was nothing to find out. The only thing that could be determined was that her mana quantity was less than that of ordinary students. 

Well, if she were an ordinary student from outside Stella, that amount of mana might be just average. 

"Did you find this out?"

"Yes? Yes..."

Eltman, who asked in a friendly tone like a peer, made Anella feel like she was suffocating. There would be no black magician in the world who could remain calm in front of Eltman, the notorious black magician slayer. 

"Hmm... How did you find out?"

"That, that is..."

"Oh, I'm not interrogating you. But since it's a significant matter, I want to know the source of the information. Don't feel pressured."

Anella fidgeted with her fingers and cautiously spoke. 

"...I overheard a conversation."

"Overheard?"

"Yes... I received help from Baek Yuseol and entered the Stella Dome staff area, but I got lost..."

It was a plausible story. It was true that she had received help from Baek Yuseol, and the Stella Dome staff area was as complex as a maze. 

"Hmm, I see. I guess we need to overhaul the structure of the Stella Dome..."

"Ugh."

The thought that her words might lead to the overhaul of the Stella Dome made her regret speaking up, but Eltman quickly moved on. 

"Then, whose conversation did you overhear?"

Gulp. Anella's throat bobbed. The moment had come. If she said she didn't see the face and didn't know, she could save a fellow black magician. But if she revealed his identity to Eltman now...

'I would be betraying my kind.'

Among black magicians, who moved by power and desire, there was a strict taboo. 

'Never betray your kind.'

Black magicians, who had to live hidden in the shadows of the world, had established this rule in the recent past when the 'Black Magic King,' 'Black Magic Cult Leader,' and 'Black Magic Union President' had gathered. It was a big rule that remained as a kind of 'oath' and became a shared belief among all black magicians. 

...But Anella had decided to give up being a black magician. 

She overcame the oath with her own will and was able to speak the name. 

"Kabaren. He said his name was Kabaren."

* * *

The match was already heading towards the middle stage. 

- As expected, most of the players have chosen to hide. Their ability to secure a position and observe and check the enemy is also impressive!

The commentator was trying hard to make it sound exciting, but this was actually the most boring part of the match. The match area was still quite large, so encounters between players were rare, and even if they met, they mostly just checked each other and went their separate ways. 

The match only became interesting in the later stages when they had to kill each other to survive, so this was a good time to take a bathroom break. 

However, this year's match was different. Because of one player, the tension couldn't be relaxed for even a moment. 

- Ah, Stella's Baek Yuseol! He quickly approaches the enemy as soon as he spots them! His superior mobility through his unique teleportation magic! His dazzling and artistic control as he freely traverses the three-dimensional space!

In the center of the stadium was a large hologram. Most of the stages were obscured by shadows, but players in areas illuminated by the artificial sun could be seen by the spectators. And Baek Yuseol often fought in places where the sunlight shone. 

- Boom! Boom! 

Flames scattered, and ice shards fell. Baek Yuseol tried to find an opening by continuously teleporting through the chaos, but the players who sensed his threat had already prepared for his teleportation. 

- Oh no! As Baek Yuseol arrives, ice spikes shoot up from all directions!

However, he smoothly slid to the ground and then soared into the sky, easily escaping the field. 

"He's fighting well."

Hong Biyeon casually remarked. 

"Right? I told you so."

"Yeah, yeah."

"See, the princess has an eye for people."

Her followers on either side echoed her words meaninglessly. It seemed like they would repeat the same words even if a recorder was placed there, but since she liked such flattery, she didn't stop them. 

- Ah, Baek Yuseol has taken down another enemy! Should we say he crushed their head this time? That's already his eighth kill! 

As expected, he didn't even need to use a sword against these kids. Baek Yuseol was taking down enemies one by one with a low-level artifact wooden club he had picked up somewhere. 

Not only that, but he also used various artifacts that appeared on the stage in very creative ways, surprising people with his innovative methods. 

- Oh, using the 'Sky Walking' artifact in such a way... It's like he's walking on terrain, tricking the enemy into falling to their death!

- He tied a 'Throwing Hook' to a 'Target Sphere' and launched himself forward! What an amazing application. I never even imagined it!

Magic Survival was a game where quietly enduring was the standard strategy, but many people cheered for Baek Yuseol's flashy performance. 

'Does he have no intention of hiding...'

In the past, Baek Yuseol would have fought moderately, but for some reason, he was desperately taking down enemies one by one. Given his mental age, this children's school competition would seem cute and ridiculous, so why was he trying so hard? 

'Hmm?'

Then, she spotted a familiar face in the opposite stands. Flame was hurriedly running somewhere with a girl, and his expression looked serious. 

Wondering if something had happened, she frowned, and then an anomaly occurred in the stadium. 

- Ah, what's happening! Three players are simultaneously attacking Baek Yuseol!

"What?"

Quickly turning her head to the stadium, she saw three boys closing in on Baek Yuseol from all directions. 

- It seems they have formed a temporary alliance to take down a strong opponent!

The commentator tried to frame it that way, but Hong Biyeon thought differently. 

'A temporary alliance? Those three faces are familiar. They were all members of Jeremy's faction. It's no coincidence that they met at that location and joined in attacking Baek Yuseol. It's clear they gathered to eliminate him.'

'Not that it matters. He won't be taken down by students of that level.'

Thinking that Baek Yuseol would show a good performance by escaping on his own, Hong Biyeon lost interest and stood up to find Flame. 

- Ah! It's unfortunate. Baek Yuseol seems unable to withstand the combined attack of the three players. Will his journey end here?

The ground was overturned, and magic was fired from all directions, making it impossible for Baek Yuseol to do anything but run away. 

"Ah, what a pity."

"He was fighting well."

"Is he going to be eliminated here..."

Regretful sighs were heard from all around, but Hong Biyeon scoffed. 

'Eliminated, my foot.'

She even thought Baek Yuseol was being malicious. He must be deliberately creating an extreme situation to get a better reaction when he escapes. 

...However, Hong Biyeon would never know. 

- Damn it! You crazy bastards! Teaming is a violation! Admin! Admin, what are you doing!

That Baek Yuseol was really running for his life right now.
