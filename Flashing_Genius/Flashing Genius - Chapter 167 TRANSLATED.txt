### I Became a Genius in the Magic School's Front Blink 167

#### 39. Ghost Story (3)

Whiooo...! A black wind blew. Although wind has no color, the wind blowing here was all a deep black. Perhaps it was because the place itself was saturated with dense dark magic. The sharply cut black cliffs rose as if trying to pierce the sky like thorns, and the ancient castle standing between them was as gigantic as the Stella Academy but slightly tilted, making it precarious.

Caw... Caw... Flocks of crows flew, and bats with glaring eyes watched over the land. It was a place where dark magic swirled, forbidding ordinary people from even approaching. 'The Screaming Cliffs, the Black Castle.' This place, once known as the residence of the 'Dark Magic King' who ruled over dark magicians, was familiar yet unwelcome to Mayuseong.

"Father, I will take my leave now." Kneeling in the center of the king's hall, Mayuseong bowed his head and spoke. The man sitting on the high throne slowly lowered his head. His red eyes gave off a chilling feeling, and it was said that ordinary dark magicians would kneel involuntarily just by meeting his gaze.

"Come closer." "Yes." When the Dark Magic King spoke bluntly, Mayuseong responded like an emotionless doll and approached him. The king looked at his son for a while.

"My son." "Yes, Father." "You are destined to become a king." "I know." "No, you don't." The Dark Magic King interrupted Mayuseong's words and added, "Among my sons, you are the weakest and the most fragile in spirit, even mixed with dirty blood. You are the worst as a successor to the throne."

"But you resemble your mother very much. That's why you are destined to be a king. Unlike me, who forcibly took the throne, you will naturally be loved by everyone, just like your mother who was loved by all." Mayuseong raised his head. His eyes still looked like those of a doll, but deep anger was burning within them, making the Dark Magic King unable to continue speaking. He knew well that anything related to his mother was the greatest taboo for his youngest son. Especially, he knew that his son hated it more than anything when he talked about it himself.

Even so, he had to speak. His youngest son still didn't know how quickly the world was changing. The Dark Magic King, he might be the strongest in this world. But how long would that last? He didn't trust his own power. Within the next five or ten years, he was sure that someone stronger than him would emerge. When that time comes, the society of dark magicians will be thoroughly crushed and destroyed. Therefore, a new king is needed. A perfect king who can encompass both humans and dark magicians, like Mayuseong who possesses both kinds of blood.

His youngest son was born with the qualities of a king. It couldn't have been a coincidence that this quality, which is extremely rare even among humans, appeared. It was surely a revelation from the heavens. Mayuseong had to become the king of the world, ruling over everything according to the destiny arranged by the gods. But his youngest son still didn't understand his deep intentions. He didn't seem to have any intention of becoming a king. Sending him to Stella Academy to study humans might have been a mistake, as he had become too deeply influenced by human society. The emotions occasionally revealed by him proved that.

"Do you hate me for forcing you to become a king?" Mayuseong shook his head. "I hate you, Father." If a son said such words without hesitation or any sign of emotion, any father would be hurt, but the Dark Magic King was not. He had already been hurt enough, and his body and mind were full of scars, leaving no room for new pain. He endured it.

"I have pushed you to your limits without any reward." His youngest son's will was firm, but he was still too young. He was young and didn't know the ways of the world. What more could he know at the age of seventeen? So he chose the easiest way to shake his young son's heart.

"My son, if you decide to become a king, I will grant you one wish." "A wish, you say?" "Yes. Is there something you desire? Or something you want? I can grant anything." Something he wanted... Seeing Mayuseong's eyes waver greatly at those words, the Dark Magic King smiled slightly. As expected, no matter how much of a genius Mayuseong was, he was still a child. The effect was certain.

"Yes, tell me what you want. I will grant it immediately." At those words, Mayuseong looked up and met the Dark Magic King's eyes, then slowly opened his lips. "I want... your head." It didn't seem like things would go smoothly after all.

It was a pity for Jeremy, who had worked hard to collect ghost stories from the 7th Tower, but Flame had little interest in the ghost stories of the 7th Tower itself. Among the countless rumors, she knew which ones were true and what they were. Knowing the 'beginning, middle, and end' of a story was exactly this. She didn't know how it would end, but she had a thorough understanding of the middle story. That was Flame's strength, which even Baek Yuseol didn't have.

Lunchtime. Jeremy, the crown prince, sat in front of Flame, who was having lunch with Anella while investigating. Flame's face crumpled like a piece of paper soaked in water. Ignoring that, Jeremy started speaking with a bright smile. "Flame, I heard an interesting story. Do you want to hear it?" "Oh, interesting." "Don't be like that. It's about the ghost stories of the 7th Tower. Aren't you interested?"

What? When Flame raised her eyes, Jeremy smiled. It was as expected. But there was another reason for her reaction. 'Did Jeremy get involved in the ghost story in this story?' Whether it was a novel or a game, there was one unavoidable part. Not all characters could always play an important role in every episode. This applied to both female-oriented and male-oriented games. And in this episode... Jeremy's role was almost nonexistent, while Mayuseong's role was very significant. But Mayuseong had returned to his home and was nowhere to be seen, and Jeremy was acting up.

'Sigh. The original story must have been twisted again.' This wasn't the first time, and there was no need to be surprised every time, but it was still honestly bewildering. "Oh, let's hear it. Tell me." As if waiting, Jeremy's eyes sparkled as he started talking about the ghost stories of the 7th Tower that he knew. Of course, most of it was useless, so Flame yawned, but Anella, sitting next to her, seemed to find it quite interesting.

"Really? There's a monster with seven heads in the 7th Tower?" "Yes, really." "Oh, that's amazing... Oh my, I'm being silly..." Sometimes Anella would say something like an old lady and try to manage her expression, which Flame found amusing and cute. Honestly speaking, everything Jeremy was saying was useless. There wasn't a single real rumor. Only Anella responded occasionally, while Flame, with a bored expression, rested her chin and sipped her drink, making Jeremy look dejected.

"Not interesting?" "No. You can go now." "Ugh." He got up weakly, then suddenly seemed to remember something and opened his mouth slightly. "Flame, just in case, I don't recommend digging too deep into this ghost story." "Huh? What do you mean?" "There are people who don't like you. A lot." Jeremy's bitter smile cast a shadow, giving Flame goosebumps. It was the first time she had seen that expression on him, but she had seen it described occasionally in the original romance fantasy. Sometimes Jeremy's smile had a shadow. No one noticed it, but the girl with blue hair recognized it.

"Jeremy, why are you so angry?" He was angry. Smiling, quietly... It was like the eye of a storm, and people didn't realize the disaster approaching them. But his anger would surely engulf everything around him. You would be no exception. In the original romance fantasy, Jeremy rarely got truly angry. The biggest outburst of anger was when Eizel's heart completely turned to Mayuseong, and they finally kissed. It didn't seem to be that much, but Jeremy was feeling quite a bit of anger now.

'Is it because I treated him coldly?' No, that didn't seem to be it. At least... Jeremy wasn't the type to get angry at a lady he liked. He would torment her until she said she wanted to die, but he wouldn't get angry. In the original romance fantasy, Jeremy only got angry when he was about to lose Eizel, whom he had a one-sided love for. In reality, his heart had turned to Flame instead of Eizel. 'Is it something related to me?' She had no idea. Even when she was in a fake relationship with Baek Yuseol, Jeremy didn't get angry, so she couldn't think of anything that would make him lose his composure like that.

"Hey, wait...!" She tried to grab Jeremy and ask again, but he had already left. "What the heck, really?"

The faculty of Stella numbered in the hundreds, so there were those who had no contact with each other at all. Conversely, it wasn't strange for professors to form groups and be friendly with each other. "Professor Raiden, I heard you had trouble with Professor Chekiren recently." "I managed to calm him down, so don't worry." "Calmed him down... Huhuhu."

Raiden was known for his terrible social skills, but he attended the faculty meetings every week. 'Sunshine Faculty Social Club' There was no need for a grand name for a social club. Just... if the age and interests matched, they would gather and become friends. This Sunshine Social Club was the same. The ages and genders were all different, and there was no common ground among the professors, but they maintained a very close relationship, with no one missing a meeting.

No, there was one common point. They were all dark magicians hiding their identities. "Recently, the number of non-attendees has increased, so the place feels empty." Elteman Eltewin had somehow found out and weeded out the dark magicians who had infiltrated the academy. Because of that, the Sunshine Social Club also had a few empty seats, which was quite a bitter thing. Out of the hundreds of faculty members, about thirty were disguised professors. It wasn't easy for dark magicians to infiltrate Stella as professors, so it required many sacrifices and costs, but in an instant, a dozen or so professors were wiped out.

But since they knew from the moment they infiltrated Stella that their comrades could quietly die, no one was sad. They were just a bit troubled. "So, Professor Raiden... I heard you took on the project this time. Can you handle it?" The project they were talking about was related to the 7th Tower. It was something the dark magicians had planned from the moment they infiltrated Stella, as the relics of Abelain Staberk, also known as the old dark magic leader, were sleeping there. At that time, they just waited because the time wasn't right, but now it was time to find the 7th Tower and retrieve it.

...But unfortunately. Despite their efforts to infiltrate, they couldn't enter as professors. Only students could enter the 7th Tower, so they had no choice but to spread rumors about it throughout Stella. "The students took the bait." "Soon, a student who meets the entry conditions might appear." "But recently, there's one student who is quite concerning." It was obvious who they were talking about. The commoner girl, Flame. Recently, she had been stirring up Stella Academy, looking for the source of the rumors, and naturally, her actions had caught the attention of the involved parties.

"Should we deal with her?" "She's a very proud kid, so I think it's quite fun to play with her. Hehe." "Yes, we are keeping a close eye on her. The moment she crosses the 'line'... we will catch her immediately." The comrades began to whisper in a sinister tone. Clearly, none of them were sane. Raiden looked around the room and then spoke decisively. "No. With Principal Elteman's vigilance heightened, it's better to stay quiet. Besides, it's impossible for a student or two running around to find out anything."

"Hmm... That's true." No matter how much Flame was praised as a genius, she was just a seventeen-year-old student. The professors had much higher status within the school, so there were significant limitations on what she could do. "So, I'll take care of anything related to Flame." Raiden was always diligent and would step in to solve anything that might cause trouble for the leader, so he was called the 'errand boy' among his comrades. Who would stop him from taking care of something that seemed troublesome?

"Hehe. Were you trying to have fun alone, Professor Raiden?" "Good. We can trust Professor Raiden with this." "Make sure to 'scold' her properly as a professor. We will take our leave." "Oh, I have a lecture soon too." Without any special signal, the meeting ended, and as the comrades left one by one, Raiden also silently stood up. '...Flame, huh.' The comrades thought Raiden would deal with Flame, but he had the opposite idea. That girl was closer to the secret of the 7th Tower than anyone else. So... wouldn't it be right to use her if possible? Thinking so, Raiden left the place last. The luxurious café room, now empty, was filled with silence.
