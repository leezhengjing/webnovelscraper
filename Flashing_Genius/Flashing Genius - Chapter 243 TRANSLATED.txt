# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 243: The Witch (10)

Following the witch hunter into their subspace, I once again faced that peculiar sense of discomfort I had felt before. It wasn't a particularly special sensation. All around were fragments of countless biological corpses used as experimental subjects. I knew well that this horrific scene was a desperate attempt by the witch hunter to extend their lifespan, but I couldn't help but feel a physiological aversion.

"It seems the interior has changed a bit since last time. Did you remodel after I left?"

From what I heard, this witch hunter was still a novice who had only managed to hunt seven witches. Some might say "only seven," but in truth, that was quite an achievement. Finding seven witches in a world where they were nearly extinct was already proof that this witch hunter had lived for decades.

"Let's see... Anyway, I should gather what I need first."

Wearing my sparrow glasses, I glanced around the laboratory. As expected, there were quite a few useful pieces of equipment for witch hunting. Although there were almost no magical tools I could use without magic, there were enough items that could serve as makeshift armor.

"Is this Allegro's Death Cloak? No, why do you have a half-burnt cloak? It's a fake."

"It was a trophy from a previous witch hunt. I didn't expect it to be a counterfeit."

"Taking Allegro's Piercing, and what's this? Throw this away. Oh, you even have Pahalen's Ancient Bracelet? Why do you have this when you don't even have a wrist?"

"...I used to have one."

"This is Sahalen's Beaker. I'll take this."

"You have a good eye for magical tools. That beaker is inscribed with a sealing array created by an ancient wizard to imprison a witch's vengeful spirit. Are you planning to capture a witch?"

"No, I'm going to use it as a throwing bomb. It burns well when ignited."

Ignoring the witch hunter's gaze, I gathered the items I needed. The witch hunter took great pride in witch hunting, so once they realized I was genuinely hunting witches, they wouldn't interfere.

"Are you planning to take all of that?"

"I'll use it and return it."

"...Understood."

After gathering all the useful magical tools, I subtly glanced at the beaker containing the "Essence of the Witch." 

"Sss."

As I smacked my lips, the witch hunter subtly moved to block it. Damn, they're quick to catch on. But honestly, I didn't plan to take more of the witch's essence. The witch's crystal orb I currently possessed was already 500 years old and couldn't grow any further. Moreover, due to the side effects of the crystal orb, I kept hearing hallucinations, so why would I want to enhance it?

"Oh, right."

"...What is it this time?"

I decided to ask since it came to mind.

"Hey, do you know what happens to a human exposed to a witch's magic?"

"Of course."

"This is just a story I heard, but what does it mean if someone keeps hearing voices in the air after being exposed to a witch's magic?"

"That's a common hallucination."

"No, it's a bit different. That wizard is exceptionally skilled in mental defense, yet it happens."

With the blessing of 'Yeonhongchun Samwol,' my mental defense abilities were among the best in the world. No matter how powerful the witch, they shouldn't be able to interfere easily, yet I kept hearing hallucinations, driving me crazy. The 500-year-old witch might have been powerful enough to break through the blessing, but she should be dead by now, so it's doubtful she still has that kind of power.

"I don't know the extent of that wizard's mental defense, but it would be difficult to block a witch's magic."

"That wizard is an 8th-class barrier mage working at the Bukom Barrier Center, yet they're suffering from witch hallucinations. Isn't that strange?"

"...A barrier mage. If we were to name the types of wizards who could counter witches, it would be barrier mages who can block all kinds of mana and spatial mages. Spatial mages are extremely rare, and it doesn't fit my current situation, so I used the example of a barrier mage who can defend against mental attacks. The witch hunter tilted their head.

"That's a bit strange."

"What is?"

"For a wizard with that level of mental defense to suffer from hallucinations, it would have to be a witch from Rohalen. But all the witches from there have been hunted, and the 'Last Witch' is sealed."

"...Really?"

Then what could it be?

"Hmm, another possibility comes to mind. Perhaps that wizard tried to communicate directly with the witch."

"That's unlikely. They hate witches."

"If not, then it's possible they connected their mind with someone else and belatedly set up a barrier, causing the other person's voice to sound like a hallucination."

"...Huh?"

At that moment, a thought struck me.

"Wait, have I visited Yiphanell recently?"

Once a spirit, now revived with the heart of a divine beast, she and I were connected by soul, able to communicate at any time. However, the mental strain was too great, so we didn't contact each other often. Recently, I had been so busy running around that I hadn't paid any attention to Yiphanell.

"Could it be...?"

If the blessing of 'Yeonhongchun Samwol' had become so powerful that it blocked telepathy, and Yiphanell was calling me...

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing. Thanks. I think I figured something out."

"...Then be careful not to damage my items."

"Of course. I'll return them as good as new, so don't worry."

Saying that, I couldn't help but think about Yiphanell, unable to focus entirely.

"Why is she calling me?"

If what the witch hunter said was true, it meant she had been trying to reach me for days. Could it be something serious?

"I'll go see her as soon as this witch hunt is over."

For now, I had to focus on the witch hunt in front of me, so I pushed the thought aside.

"Anyway, thanks. I'll make good use of these."

Waving goodbye to the witch hunter who had generously lent me magical tools for the noble goal of witch hunting, I left the subspace.

Swoosh!

I knew exactly where she was hiding.

"The underground sewers."

Now, all that was left was to cut off the witch's head.

* * *

## Arcanium, Underground Sewers

Drip! Avoiding the dripping water, Melisher trudged along, leaning against the wall to catch her breath. The recovery speed of her magic had significantly increased since she retrieved her heart and placed it back in her chest, but the pain from being stabbed by the witch hunter still lingered. However, her wounds were almost healed. Once her magic was fully recovered, she could resume running her restaurant.

"Not enough."

She needed to recover her magic faster. Should she capture and absorb a black magician wandering the sewers? No, that wouldn't be very efficient. Besides, if she provoked the Black Magic Union's magicians, they would retaliate as a group, which would be quite troublesome. They were crazy enough to use any excuse to go on a rampage.

"Rather..."

As she clutched her chest, feeling the heartbeat, a chilling sensation surged through her body. Instinctively, she cast an illusion barrier in the air.

Clang...!!

The underground sewer began to crack like shattered glass, blocking the massive shadow's scythe that flew through the air.

Crash!!

As the glass shattered, the underground sewer twisted, with the ceiling collapsing to the floor and the floor rising to the ceiling, distorting the space.

"...Witch, found you."

A chilling voice pierced through her mind. Her whole body shivered, and her hair stood on end. Melisher slowly raised her head, looking up at the underground sewer's ceiling. A fluttering black robe. A figure darker than darkness itself, with red eyes glowing menacingly like the sun against the moonlight.

"Witch hunter...!"

This was on a different level from the witch she had encountered before. She felt like a mouse before a cat. Gripping her staff with trembling hands, she muttered.

"Ha... Damn it..."

She had known this day would come. Without her witch restaurant, she had almost no chance of winning. She knew she couldn't win, but her lips curled into a smile.

"Finally found you."

Ignoring her words, the witch hunter slowly raised the massive scythe, designed solely to behead witches. Melisher slammed her staff into the ground.

Boom!!

With a loud explosion, the underground sewer shattered into pieces, soaring into the air. The distinction between up and down disappeared, and the fragments scattered into smaller pieces. Yet, the witch hunter didn't move an inch.

"Foolishness..."

"Foolishness? Don't make me laugh. This is a show I prepared to hunt you witch hunters! You're the first sacrifice!"

Boom!!

The ceiling of the underground sewer broke, and the floor of Arcanium collapsed. Brilliant moonlight poured into the underground.

Swish!

"...Ugh!"

The witch hunter's scythe sliced through the space, splitting the illusion in half. Melisher barely blocked the attack with a giant lotus illusion in the air but coughed up blood from internal injuries.

"Cough... But it's fine."

Melisher didn't hold back her magic, covering the entire area with her illusion. The purple dawn sky reversed to green, and the dark clouds turned gray, reflecting the air.

"No doubt about it."

That witch hunter possessed the ability of the "Breath of the Dead Witch." It was a deadly ability for witches, but if she could absorb it perfectly...

Melisher would gain complete immunity to witch hunters. A witch who no longer had to be chased by witch hunters. If such a witch existed in the world...

"I could rule the magical world with my own hands!"

A witch restaurant? She wouldn't need to bother with such a tedious task. If she could control both illusion and reality, she would have the ultimate magic. Why bother with preliminary work?

It was something she had planned for a long time. Inheriting the prophecy from her ancestor, the "Last Witch," she had prepared the final spell to absorb the witch hunter's ability.

"An illusion is just an illusion."

That's what you witch hunters always say. But that won't hold true anymore.

"Reality will become an illusion too."

The witch hunter's eyes changed. Red eyes gleamed as they scattered black space to suppress the illusion, but it was useless. The "perfect illusion indistinguishable from reality" created by consuming even her lifespan couldn't be broken by such tricks.

Crackle!!

"Strike down!"

As Melisher chanted and swung her broom, red lightning struck the witch hunter. The witch hunter staggered momentarily from the blow to their real body but quickly regained their stance and swung the scythe in the air. The illusion began to scatter like dust, but Melisher clenched her hand in the air, stopping it.

"You're not an ordinary witch."

"Of course not."

As the mother of all witches and the one who kept witches as witches, the "Last Witch" had directly passed down her magic to Melisher, giving her abilities different from other witches.

"I can finally fulfill my long-cherished wish..."

A world where witches no longer had to hide. The Last Witch only wanted such a world. But witches, by nature, couldn't mingle with humans. They were different from those inferior beings who were swayed by emotions, formed societies, and bound themselves by laws. Witches could be perfect alone and stand at the pinnacle of the world. Why should they compromise with inferior species?

"Just rule over them."

Crash!

As Melisher stabbed her broom into the air, the space shattered, trying to tear the witch hunter's body apart. The witch hunter tried to endure by surrounding themselves with a black shield, but they were reaching their limit.

"That power... it only consumes your lifespan..."

She knew that. But what did it matter? After this fight, if she absorbed the "Breath of the Dead Witch," she would gain a perfect body and perhaps even live forever.

"Think that way and die. You're just a stepping stone for me."

"...Pity."

The witch hunter finally sensed their end, closed their eyes, and scattered into pieces, disappearing completely in the four-dimensional space. Watching the witch hunter vanish without leaving a corpse, Melisher gritted her teeth and smiled.

"Heh, heh heh. It was easier than I thought."

She had tried to divert the witch hunter's attention by leaving her scent on the blue-haired witch she met at the restaurant, but it would have been a disaster if she hadn't faced the witch hunter herself.

"If I hadn't encountered that witch hunter, I would have regretted it."

Thanks to facing the witch hunter herself, she had gained the ultimate ability.

"Sigh..."

Forcing strength into her thighs, Melisher approached the witch hunter's remains. Once she absorbed that essence, everything would be over. Or so she thought.

Clatter!

Suddenly, someone appeared from the shadows and grabbed the witch hunter's essence.

"What...?"

The boy was wearing the Stella Academy uniform, had black eyes and black hair, and was holding a staff emitting a beautiful light. But more importantly...

"The flow of mana... is strange..."

There was no mana in the boy's body. No, to be precise, the moment natural mana entered his body, it was immediately expelled. As if his body rejected mana.

"How is that possible..."

Then, a thought flashed through Melisher's mind. Something the Last Witch had said a long time ago.

"Are you...?"

But before Melisher could finish her sentence, the boy raised his sword and closed the distance.

Whoosh!

She closed her eyes and opened them again. The boy had already closed the ten-step distance and was swinging his sword at her neck. At that moment, she realized.

"All things in the world flow with the fate of mana. No being can defy it. Even the stars and gods in the sky contain mana."

As she swung her broom to create a wave of illusion to block the sword of light, she wondered if the reason this being felt familiar was because of the Last Witch's words.

"But if there exists someone without mana... they could defy even fate."

At that time, she had asked what to do if such a being existed.

"Run. Don't look back."

The Last Witch's voice was unbelievably weak. 

Clang!!

She sent a powerful illusion at the boy, but he easily pierced through it and swung his sword at her neck.

"Ha, he really exists..."

She had dismissed it as a legend, but here he was, in reality. However, Melisher couldn't heed the Last Witch's advice.

"Run without looking back? How could I..."

Suddenly, her eyes turned cold.

"When he looks so delicious!"

Melisher shouted, stabbing her staff into the sky. Instantly, the world turned upside down.

"If even the Last Witch feared him..."

I'll hunt and absorb him.

Melisher made her decision.
