### The End of Summer (3)

How often does an ordinary person encounter a mythical being like the 'Twelve Celestial Guardians' in their lifetime? Even if they did, would they believe in such an existence? For someone like Jelliel, who has lived her life assigning monetary value to everything in a capitalist world, even if a legendary figure from folklore appeared before her, she wouldn't bat an eye. 

Golden rule. If she couldn't see it with her own eyes and put a price tag on it, she couldn't trust it. This extremely realistic and rational way of thinking had never failed her, so she lived without doubt. People often say, "Money can't buy happiness." Jelliel never believed that. The more money she had, the happier she felt. 

However... 

Today, Jelliel, the undisputed richest person in the world who controlled everything with money, realized belatedly that there are things money can't buy. 

"Follow that path." 

The voice of an old man echoed in her mind. His identity was undoubtedly one of the Twelve Celestial Guardians. Even though she met the being that all the world's wizards longed for, it didn't move her much. She simply followed him quietly because she sensed a whiff of hope from him. 

"Hey, Henry. How's life these days?" 

"Don't even ask. Business tanked this summer. Give me some makgeolli." 

"Tsk tsk. That's why I told you to quit early and start a business with me." 

In the southern part of the Hawol Plains, at the Myoho Tribe Lake. The Myoho Tribe Lake, located at the center of the southern plains trade route, was a sizable village, and the beastmen with tiger-striped cat ears were quite noticeable. 

Swoosh! 

Sitting quietly in a street tavern, her face hidden under a hat, Jelliel sipped water. She wasn't hungry, but she had to supply minimal nutrients to keep walking, so it was an unavoidable act of sustenance. She quietly ate while eavesdropping on the conversations of the surrounding merchants. 

"Sigh... I should have gone into business with you." 

"Did the rain ruin your business?" 

"Well, it rains this much every year, so that's not the reason." 

The young merchant gulped down a high-proof drink. The bamboo-made cup was impressive. 

"Ugh... Honestly, there's nothing wrong with my business skills." 

"That's what all the failures say." 

"No, really. This time, the Wind Merchant Guild launched a big campaign with coated umbrellas. It was a huge hit." 

"And then?" 

The young man whispered in a low voice, glancing around. 

"...The Starcloud Guild completely overturned the market." 

"What? Them again?" 

"Yeah. Their new item clashed with ours, so they completely ruined our business." 

"Tsk, selfish bastards." 

"They're always like that. If they think they'll lose even a little, they overturn the whole market. But they're so powerful that we can't do anything about it. What can we do?" 

Clatter! 

"What, what was that?" 

The merchants, who had been quietly badmouthing the Starcloud Guild, were startled by the sound of a water cup tipping over nearby. 

"...I'm sorry." 

Jelliel quietly apologized, set the cup upright, and wiped the table with a tissue. Her fingertips trembled. She was all too familiar with their conversation. It had to be. It was something that happened under Jelliel's orders. 

Her father had always led the business with integrity, never engaging in such dirty deeds. But when Jelliel started thinking like a merchant, the Starcloud Guild was shaken by her father's stubbornness, and she began to secretly engage in dirty deeds behind his back. 

"If it makes money, I'll do anything." 

She had even killed people and brought down entire companies. Jelliel, who had no sense of guilt, never hesitated in her actions. 

"Sigh, it's a big problem. My wife and kids are waiting at home, but we'll run out of food by winter. Forget heating; we have to worry about meals first." 

"Tsk tsk. Don't worry. I'll help you. If you want, you can work with me until your failed business recovers." 

"...Thank you, really." 

"Don't mention it. You saved my life back then, so I'm just returning the favor. In a way, you saved yourself. Haha, wasn't that a bit cool? I should write that in my autobiography." 

"It would have been perfect if not for the last part." 

"Hahaha!" 

The conversation ended on a warm note, but would it be the same for others? Even at this moment, countless people were suffering and dying from poverty somewhere out of sight. It could be because of Jelliel, or it might not be... 

Why did a pure white wave keep crashing violently in her mind? 

'I can help.' 

If she got up right now and handed a few gold bars to that young merchant, she could save him. With her financial power, it was entirely possible. 

"Sigh, this business is doomed..." 

"Sigh. The economy is so bad these days..." 

"What happened to the butcher who left to start a business?" 

"He went bankrupt." 

It wasn't just the young merchant. People everywhere were groaning. The above story wasn't limited to the Myoho Tribe Lake. 

Jelliel had crossed the Hawol Plains on her journey to retrieve Baek Yuseol, passing through numerous tribes, villages, and cities, all of which had the same concerns. And... the most representative reason for their struggles was her own reckless business policies. 

Something was piling up in her heart. Then, suddenly, she had a realization. 

'I can change it.' 

Money couldn't buy everything. She had recently realized that, but the world still revolved around gold. If she could change the world with her overwhelming wealth... Surely, that boy would be happy. He was someone who would sacrifice himself for others before taking care of himself. 

Jelliel walked and walked across the Hawol Plains. Through rainy mornings, foggy dawns, and clear nights when the Milky Way bridge unfolded. 

At the end of a completely natural land, unconnected by magic trains or warp holes. 

- You've arrived. 

Jelliel finally reached her destination. A cliff piercing through the clouds. Atop it stood a pure white temple, where the old man she had seen before waited with his hands behind his back. He gestured for her to follow, pointing straight ahead. There... a staircase unfolded. A staircase leading to the sky. 

- Some call this the staircase to heaven. Nonsense. Heaven is the afterlife, foolish humans. 

The old man's joke wasn't funny, but Jelliel laughed. 

- It's the path to the past. Go there yourself and bring back Baek Yuseol. 

The staircase soared high into the sky, its end unseen. 

- But remember one thing. 

He spoke with a stern expression to Jelliel, who stood before the staircase. 

- Though I am a drunkard and a gambler, I am also a sacred being connected to the stars. Those who are full of sins and karma cannot step on this staircase. 

"Why?" 

- Because stepping on it would be more painful than death. And judging by your face, you've accumulated countless sins in your life. 

It was true, so she couldn't refute it. 

- You... might really die. A high elf who hasn't even lived half a century can't withstand this karma. 

"I can do it." 

- Fine. If you have the courage, atone through this pain. All the despair and sorrow they suffered will be contained within. 

"No." 

Shaking her head, she spoke with a determined face. 

"I will accept this pain because I caused it, but I won't atone this way." 

- Then? 

"I will atone in my own way." 

She couldn't return everything she had taken from them. She would have to live with her karma for the rest of her life. So, she would throw away her mask and devote herself to the world in the only way she could. 

"This pain... is the punishment I deserve." 

Jelliel took off her shoes and, without hesitation, stepped onto the staircase. 

At that moment, a terrible pain, as if her entire body was being sawed, swept through her soul. With bloodshot eyes, she took another step. She didn't scream. 

One step. Another step. 

Clenching her eyes shut, she climbed the staircase, enduring all the pain. She had no intention of running away now. If she were to run, she would rather fall and die. But she couldn't die here. If she died here, Baek Yuseol might never return to this world. 

Each step was a hell, and each step made her want to scream and collapse. But she endured. 

'I have no right to collapse.' 

Many people had felt such pain because of her. The blade of emotion that seeped into her dry heart tore at her soul, but ironically, it was also the reason she could endure. 

A desperate heart for someone. 

How far had she climbed? She didn't look at the destination. To be precise, she didn't have the time to. Her soul was barely holding on, torn to shreds, and it was a miracle she was still alive. 

Her breath was stifled, her feet numb, and another wave of sorrow and despair seeped through the cracks in her heart, whispering for her to give up. But she couldn't stop now. 

Could it be called willpower? No, now she was really... moving on instinct. 

Then, at the last moment. 

She had no strength left to lift her foot, and her ankle caught on the step. 

'Ah...' 

She realized. If she fell now, she would never get up again. 

'I can't...' 

If she collapsed here, she couldn't save anyone. But she had no strength left to straighten her body, so she entrusted herself to the laws of nature. 

Thud! 

...Strangely enough, it didn't hurt at all. 

Had she suffered so much that this was nothing? 

"...I was told someone would come to meet me, and it was you?" 

At the sound of a voice, Jelliel slowly opened her eyes. 

So close that she could feel his breath... was the face of that boy. 

'Ah.' 

She had succeeded. 

Climbing that endless staircase, she had finally reached him. 

Weakly leaning into Baek Yuseol's arms, Jelliel smiled faintly. 

It was the most amazing and miraculous sight she had ever seen, and Baek Yuseol was genuinely astonished. 

"What's with you? You look like someone who ate a vegetable bun without any vegetables." 

She had longed to meet him so much, yet the first thing he said upon their reunion was such a dull and unfunny joke. 

Even that. 

It was so Baek Yuseol, so unmistakably Baek Yuseol. 

Jelliel laughed through her tears.
