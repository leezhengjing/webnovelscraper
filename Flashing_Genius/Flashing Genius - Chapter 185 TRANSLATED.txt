### Chapter 185: Isolation (3)

Right after Hong Biyeon left Stella Academy, Baek Yuseol immediately prepared to follow her. He packed various magical tools and items in case of emergencies. The technology of Alterisha had been growing rapidly, and many of these items were now practical for real combat. With this level of technology, he thought it might soon be possible to create an 'interdimensional space' with the help of El Terman and El Twin.

"Are you planning to follow her?" Flame stopped Baek Yuseol, who was about to leave in a hurry. She asked with a worried expression, "What exactly is going on?"

"Not sure."

"If you're going, I'm coming with you."

Flame spoke with a determined expression, but Baek Yuseol shook his head. "No, it's fine. I'll handle it."

"How? No matter how skilled you are, this isn't something you can handle alone."

"Exactly. And having you along won't solve the problem either."

"Thatâ€™s... true."

Baek Yuseol and Flame were just ordinary citizens, except for their status as students of Stella Academy. While showing a Stella student ID or diploma could earn them respect comparable to nobility anywhere in the world, there were limits. It would be unwise to present a Stella student ID to the Adolevit royal family. 

Of course, aside from that, Baek Yuseol had a rather unique background for a commoner. He was acquainted with the Elf King and was a co-developer of various items. But so what? Even with such connections, he couldn't possibly confront Adolevit. Even if Baek Yuseol had power and influence equal to Adolevit, this was a family matter. What right did he have to interfere with the Queen's decision to exile her princess? Even if there were a superpower greater than Adolevit in this world, it would still be impossible.

"So, what exactly are you planning to do?"

"Not sure. I'll have to find another way."

"...And you don't need me for that?"

"Probably."

After speaking indifferently, Baek Yuseol was about to shoulder his backpack when he turned around. Normally, Flame would have said something lively, but today she was unusually downcast, her head bowed, and she said nothing.

'What's going on?' Flame seemed different today. Was there a problem with their conversation? It was the usual casual talk. No matter how much he thought about it, he couldn't figure it out. 'Is she upset?' That seemed unlikely. From what Baek Yuseol knew, Flame wouldn't get upset over such a conversation. She had a very cool personality.

Baek Yuseol was about to ask something but immediately closed his mouth.

[Through the power of Yeonhongchunsamwol, he could infer the other person's psychological state through their expression and receive the color of their heart. It was a deep blue. Flame was feeling blue. It wasn't a clear, refreshing blue. It was a blue that seemed to have been struck hard by something, a wounded blue.]

'Did I say something that harsh?' He could see what he hadn't noticed before. Her emotions were so delicate and vivid that they were clearly visible. Even though Baek Yuseol was usually oblivious, he knew how to act in this situation.

"Well, I guess it can't be helped. I have things to do at school too..."

"It's dangerous."

"...Huh?"

"This is the first time something like this has happened, so I don't know what will happen. That's why I'm not taking you. It's dangerous."

"Oh, okay... I see."

When Baek Yuseol said that, Flame felt a bit dazed. It was clearly a comforting statement.

"I'll be going now."

As Baek Yuseol turned and left, Flame waved her hand and saw him off nonchalantly. After walking for a long time until Baek Yuseol was out of sight, she suddenly kicked a nearby tree.

Bang!

It was a perfect roundhouse kick with a 720-degree spin, sharp and beautiful.

"Argh! You idiot! So embarrassing!"

She couldn't control her expression at all, acting immaturely. She was worried about someone who was about to face a big challenge over such a trivial matter.

"Huff, huff... Huff..."

After hitting the tree for a while, she was so exhausted that she couldn't move anymore. However, her anger towards herself still hadn't subsided.

"Ugh... I just want to die..."

As she was banging her head against the tree, suddenly, she heard voices echoing from the sky. It wasn't a hallucination from hitting her head too hard.

-Flame, are you okay? You seem really tired. Do you need our help?

"...Ah."

It was the angels watching over her from the highest heavens. Flame looked up at the sky. She remembered that the celestial realm had a calming effect on the mind, and she thought that maybe beating up those annoying angels would help her regain her shattered mental state.

"Yeah, let's go there for a bit."

-Of course! We'll open the 'High Frost' for you right away.

As expected, they immediately opened the High Frost, also known as the 'Bridge of Heaven,' for her. Flame didn't care how much mana of the angels was consumed in the process.

With a sound like rolling jade beads, a warm golden light poured down from the sky. Normally, she didn't like to stand out, so she rarely used it, but now she didn't care.

Flap!

A pair of translucent golden wings sprouted from Flame's back, scattering golden feathers everywhere. As the glowing light filled the area and her body began to float into the air...

Thud!

"Huh?"

She sensed someone's presence. Flame turned her indifferent eyes to the side. Normally, she would have felt quite embarrassed to be caught in this scene, but after experiencing something even more embarrassing just now, she didn't care.

"Fl... Flame..."

A boy stood there, muttering her name blankly. He had a broad build and a short haircut, and Flame knew him well. He was Pung Harang of Class S, Year 1. As a direct descendant of the Pung family, which ruled the entire southern plains, he had entered Stella to win the power struggle with his brothers. Normally, his charismatic and imposing expression was his identity, but even he seemed flustered by Flame's winged appearance.

"What are you looking at? Never seen a person with wings before?"

"Uh, well..."

With an indifferent expression, she raised her fist.

"If you tell anyone, you're dead."

Flash!

Immediately after, Flame turned into light and disappeared, leaving Pung Harang to collapse on the spot.

'What did I just see...?'

He didn't have many interactions with her, so he hadn't thought much of her, but today's impression was so strong that he couldn't forget her face, staring blankly at the spot where she had disappeared.

### Frostcliff Palace

The name itself didn't match Adolevit, who wielded fire, but the 'Cheongryeong Palace' where Hong Biyeon stayed was even more ridiculous. It was named after an Adolevit hero who fought against the Black Demons with blue hair. In contrast, her sister Hong Siwha's palace was named 'Hongyeon Palace,' which evoked a red image even without the story of a great person.

From birth, the princesses' residences were predetermined, so even if Princess Hong Erin hadn't died, Hong Biyeon would have been disliked from the start. Her mother, Hong Iel, had opposed the current king, Hong Seryu, and was thoroughly defeated. Her sister Hong Siwha's mother had clung to Hong Seryu, giving up the throne to enjoy a slightly more comfortable and longer life. But even she couldn't withstand the curse and died three years after giving birth to Hong Siwha, in her thirties.

If she couldn't inherit the throne, her life would be meaningless.

"Princess, the Red Millen tea is ready."

"...Alright."

Dressed in a white-patterned dress with a red background, Hong Biyeon enjoyed tea time in the garden of Cheongryeong Palace. The expression 'enjoyed' was ironic because she didn't really enjoy it. As a princess of Adolevit, she had to spend at least an hour a day on tea time.

"Oh my, sister. Relax your expression! Isn't it nice to be back in the palace?"

Hong Siwha, sitting across from Hong Biyeon, who was staring blankly at the tea being poured by a maid, joked. Unlike her usual preference for suits, Hong Siwha wore a dazzling dress after returning to the palace. She waved her fan and said, "How is it? Tell me your thoughts. I've always liked Cheongryeong Palace since I was a child."

"It's nice."

"Oh, is that all?"

"Yes."

Hong Biyeon had no intention of playing along with her sister's jokes. Despite her indifferent response, Hong Siwha smiled brightly, as if she found it amusing. Knowing that Hong Siwha's emotions were shallow, Hong Biyeon found her mask of joy extremely repulsive.

The conversation was one-sided. Hong Siwha talked, and Hong Biyeon responded. To get through this tedious time, Hong Biyeon didn't let go of her teacup. Red Millen tea was one of the few teas she liked.

Then, suddenly.

Clatter, splash!

"Ah!"

One of the maids 'accidentally' spilled tea on Hong Biyeon's dress.

"I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!"

The maid immediately bowed her head in apology, but Hong Biyeon just stared at her, holding her teacup, without saying a word. It was intentional. Hong Biyeon, who had been subtly ignored in the palace, knew this well. She was used to such treatment by now.

'Hmm...'

She wasn't particularly angry. She was just contemplating how to respond. Should she get angry? If she did, rumors would spread in the palace that she was a princess with a terrible temper despite having nothing. Her enemies would increase, and she would continue to be ignored without a chance to clear her tarnished image.

Should she forgive? That was also difficult. Despite being ignored, Hong Biyeon was still a direct royal bloodline. If she simply said it was okay and let it go, similar incidents would repeat. Subtle disrespect and bullying would continue, and her influence would diminish further.

The wisest response was clear from the start. First, ask about the maid's family and quietly question her mistake. Then, explain how serious her offense against royalty was and scare her with the possibility of punishment before showing mercy and forgiving her. This way, she could assert her royal dignity without getting angry, preventing further disrespect and rumors.

Perhaps, her wise judgment might even earn her a positive image, with people saying Princess Hong Biyeon was actually kind and smart.

...However, despite thinking this far, 'I don't like it.'

She didn't bother to act that way. Instead, she stood up and slapped the maid.

Slap!

"Ah!"

She slapped so hard that the maid's cheek turned red like fire. As the maid fell to the ground, Hong Biyeon spoke coldly.

"Be grateful I didn't burn you."

"Y-yes..."

"Your family."

"Pardon...?"

"Tell me your family name."

"I'm Herael from the Baron Harain family..."

"Baron Harain? Never heard of it. I'll remember your family."

"Ah..."

After saying that, Hong Biyeon turned and left.

"I'll be going now."

"Oh my..."

Leaving the wide-eyed Hong Siwha behind, Hong Biyeon walked straight to Cheongryeong Palace. Was she really angry? No. In fact, she was grateful for the spilled tea, as it allowed her to end the tea time. She even felt like rewarding Baron Harain.

But aside from that, 'If I keep enduring this, I'll die of stress.'

She was destined to be trapped here for life. Escape was impossible unless she gave up all her magic and power. It was bitter, but Hong Biyeon accepted her fate. However, that didn't mean she would endure everything.

'They think they can ignore and belittle me... No way. Just because I have no power or influence doesn't mean I can't do anything. At least while I'm trapped here... I'll make sure everyone in the palace fears my name.'
