# I Became a Genius in Front of the Magic School

## Chapter 245: The Witch (12)

Shatter! A shard of glass grazed past his cheek. Although it was just a slight graze, the stinging sensation was vivid, and Bai Yushe frowned as he belatedly sensed the pain.

"Damn it. It's so hard to distinguish."

Even though he had heightened his senses to the maximum, his opponent was a magician several levels above him, making it difficult to accurately detect the attacks. The opponent's abilities were so strong that they could even neutralize the overwhelming advantage of not being affected by illusion magic.

Thud! Thud! Thud! The sound of soap bubbles pouring down from the ceiling. Despite their pretty appearance, these bubbles boasted a brute force that exploded everything they touched. This time, however, he did not avoid them. There was no need to dodge this attack.

"Five steps."

Ignoring the bubbles, he sprinted forward with precise steps and then blinked. After moving 10 meters, he swung his sword, but the opponent summoned a stone tablet inscribed with ancient runes to block it.

"Two steps back."

As he quickly retreated, a giant sword's foreleg emerged from the ground, sweeping past the spot where he had just stood. If that attack had hit... it might have been quite dangerous.

"But now, I understand for sure."

Bai Yushe narrowed his eyes and stared at the illusion that dominated the entire space. Illusion magic scatters the opponent's mana, making them see things that aren't there. Normally, it wouldn't work on him at all, but...

"Some of the magic has a physical form."

An illusion with a physical form. It was an ironic statement, but it was true. Melisher had inherited the abilities of the legendary magician who could manifest illusions into reality, the "Last Witch." This overwhelming magic, which cast illusions on the world itself rather than the opponent's mind, had only appeared three times in the original game, each time showcasing its brutal power and shocking the players.

And this was the first appearance. Depending on the choices in the [Episode], if the wrong choice was made, players would face Melisher in a direct boss battle. The first strategy guide for this battle was this: "Use a bug to revert the data file." Melisher's boss battle required suppressing the onslaught of illusion magic and receiving help from Kaen and Hyejin, who were likely hiding somewhere in Arcanium, or support from the Stella Knights. If one had to fight alone... the chances of winning were zero.

"But the character Bai Yushe was different."

At that time, Bai Yushe was the only person on Earth who had trained the character Bai Yushe from summer vacation until the start of the school season. During his battle with Melisher, he observed a very special phenomenon: he could distinguish between the witch's magic attacks that had a physical form. In other words, the character Bai Yushe was completely immune to incomplete illusion magic that lacked a physical form. Although the attacks with and without physical forms were indicated by colors, distinguishing them one by one was not easy, and he remembered spending dozens of hours strategizing against the witch Melisher.

"I never thought I'd have to fight again in reality... but those memories definitely helped."

"The bubbles are fake, but most of the attacks in the form of animals are real."

He dodged some attacks with all his might, while pretending to dodge others, making Melisher lower her guard. She still didn't realize that there were gaps in her magic. Naturally, unless one had mana leakage retardation, they would be completely caught in the illusions and wouldn't need to distinguish between "illusions with physical forms" and "illusions without physical forms."

"According to the settings... Melisher's abilities are still growing."

Since she was still growing, only a few illusions had physical forms, which became a critical strategy point for Bai Yushe, but he couldn't be complacent.

"This is reality."

In Aether World Online, it was enough to exploit weaknesses and strategize, but as always, the game and reality were different. Bai Yushe had one concern.

"Melisher... realizing her own magic."

According to the original plan, she needed the power of a special witch hunter to grow one step further. However, in reality, something else might act as a catalyst, causing her abilities to explode. Even knowing the weaknesses and having a favorable matchup didn't guarantee an advantage in the actual battle.

"There are no attack opportunities at all..."

He had deliberately hidden the maximum range of his blink by about 2 meters, leaving it as a last resort, but there was no suitable opportunity to use it. Melisher was trying to keep as much distance as possible to comfortably deal with the out-of-standard magic called blink.

"Still, I can force an attack opportunity!"

[Blink]

He skillfully dodged the rocks rising from the ground and swung his sword after teleporting. Melisher hastily deployed a snail shell-shaped shield in mid-air. But that was also a trap. Bai Yushe pressed the button on the small light he held in his left hand and swept it over the snail shell, causing the illusion magic to disappear instantly.

"Ah...!"

That was undoubtedly a witch hunter's magical tool.

"But...!"

Melisher gritted her teeth, clapped her hands, and brought them to her chest. Branches sprouted from her back, covering her entire body, and Bai Yushe's sword bounced off them.

"Ugh...?!"

The unexpected recoil caused Bai Yushe to lose his balance and stagger.

"Damn it...!"

In that fleeting moment, Bai Yushe sensed danger. He had shown too big a gap against a veteran magician, and there was still a slight delay before his next blink. If he were hit by an attack in this state, he would surely suffer a fatal injury. He braced himself for the impact, but...

Thud!

"...Huh?"

Melisher did not attack Bai Yushe. Instead, she retreated significantly, raising her trembling hand and pointing her broom at him.

"Why isn't she attacking?"

Although he was grateful for being spared, Bai Yushe couldn't understand her actions. However, from her perspective, it was a rational decision.

"A forced gap."

Melisher had faced countless enemies over her decades of life. She had long realized that the opponent she was facing now was quite skilled. A veteran magic warrior showing such a large gap? It was impossible.

"Ridiculous."

Such a crude trick wouldn't work.

"...Hmph."

Then, seeing Bai Yushe slowly regaining his balance, Melisher's mind went blank.

"What? That attitude."

She had already figured out that he was trying to lure her into attacking by showing a gap. Yet, he continued to stagger as if he couldn't regain his balance. This was no longer a magic battle or a psychological battle. It was more like mocking the opponent by underestimating them.

Realizing this, she shouted in frustration.

"Don't be ridiculous!!"

"What? I'm already struggling, and now she's shouting?"

Bai Yushe was greatly startled by her sudden outburst. But Melisher, as if disgusted by his reaction, screamed even louder.

"Do you know what I've been through to get here? Do you think I came here to be toyed with by a lowly human like you? What are you doing?!"

Blood seeped from her tightly clenched lips. It wasn't a wound inflicted by Bai Yushe. She had bitten her lips so hard that they bled.

"How dare you... do you know what kind of resolve I have... to joke around... After all these battles, you have to realize. My attacks don't work on him at all. The reality is so stark that it makes me feel hopeless. But... he doesn't kill me. Why?"

No matter how much she thought about it, there was only one reason.

"I will... recreate the world of witches. A witch's village, a witch's city, a witch's country. Do you think it's funny that I'm running a restaurant?"

From the moment she opened her eyes, the witch was alone. It was fate, providence, and an unchangeable truth. A witch without social skills or emotions was like a starving beast, always fighting for territory, never yielding. In the end, witches couldn't unite and were hunted down one by one by witch hunters, now living miserably in hiding. Once, they were called the most superior and excellent race on earth, capable of conquering the world if they wished...

Melisher hated that. Society? Country? Loneliness? Her reasons for wanting to create were different.

"I'm tired of being looked down upon by inferior races. And now, even after coming this far, I have to be ignored by an inferior human who can't even use magic...?"

Bai Yushe hardened his expression and pointed his sword again. The opponent had misunderstood something, but there was no need to correct it. It was rather convenient. Thinking so, he tried to prepare for battle again, but suddenly...

"Wait."

Melisher dropped her arms.

"No, no. Ah, I see."

Tilting her head to the side, she stared at Bai Yushe with empty, hollow eyes, as if trying to see through him.

"Why haven't you killed me and dragged this out?"

"To play a joke? No. I thought so, but... thinking again, that's not it. Right?"

Bai Yushe didn't respond. But Melisher, as if gaining confidence, twisted her lips into a grotesque smile.

"Ah, I see. You're afraid of this space, aren't you? Illusions may not work on you, but... if you kill me, you won't be able to escape from this space completely isolated from reality!"

"...Wait, what?"

What was she talking about? He didn't want to understand, but the automatic interpretation function of the magpie glasses deciphered the magic and injected it into his mind, whether he wanted it or not. After a brief headache, as if a lightning bolt had pierced his head, Bai Yushe raised his head in bewilderment.

[Illusion Space]
* Type: Reality-based illusion (Witch)
* Interpretation: A witch who has reached the pinnacle of illusion magic can create a new space through imagination.
* Analysis: This space is a new dimension isolated from reality...
* Reverse Calculation Formula▼
"Void type, space type, reality-based illusion, charm type..."

Amidst the flood of countless pieces of information, Bai Yushe found the most important sentence.

"Is it really... an isolated space?"

This was the first time he had heard of such a thing. No, the idea of an isolated space itself was absurd. In Aether World Online, Melisher couldn't use such advanced magic. Even if it was an illusion, distorting the space itself would require at least five 7th-class space magicians.

"Reverse calculation... is impossible."

The types required to reverse calculate illusion space magic were all rare, so even if Bai Yushe didn't have mana leakage retardation, escaping from here would have been practically impossible. Suddenly, cold sweat began to pour down. Winning the battle was no longer a priority.

"Ahaha... Now I understand. Knowing what you're afraid of, there's no need to drag this out any longer, right?"

Laughing hollowly, Melisher pointed her index finger at the air. Thud! A small ripple spread through the air as if tapping a light glass bell. However, it had an influence that encompassed the entire space.

"Closing the space."

"You must have been thinking of ways to escape, but... you didn't know this, did you?"

Bai Yushe hurriedly ran towards the wall of the illusion barrier and swung his sword, but clang! The dull impact was like hitting a steel wall with a wooden stick, and it had no effect.

"This is crazy! If you do this, you won't be able to escape either!"

"So what?"

She was going to die anyway, so what did it matter now? Moreover, if she was lucky enough to kill Bai Yushe and absorb him, she could obtain the essence of a witch hunter, making it no problem to open the closed illusion barrier.

"Ah, your expression... has become fierce. Have you finally lost your composure? Are you thinking of taking me seriously now?"

She elegantly covered her mouth with the back of her hand and laughed like a refined lady.

"But what will you do? Even if you kill me now, you'll be trapped in the illusion forever."

When Bai Yushe silently pointed his sword, Melisher's smile deepened with satisfaction.

"This is the price for trampling on my pride and mocking me. Accept it."

She stood her broom vertically and gracefully mounted it, her crimson lips parting.

"Now, show me your full strength."

Melisher's body floated, passing through the ceiling of the underground sewer and rising into the sky above Arcanium. Then, she laughed softly.

"Before we go, we can at least protect each other's pride, right?"

She whispered in a gentle tone to Bai Yushe, who was looking at her.
