# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy's Frontline

## Chapter 160: Orb of Souls (4)

Eltman prepared a special reception room for Kkot Seorin, considering her needs. The room was designed to block out sunlight and had a spatial barrier to prevent any curses from leaking out. After stationing her guards and closest aides in the adjacent room, she entered the reception room with Baek Yuseol. The room was not very large but had a cozy and warm atmosphere.

Kkot Seorin sat Baek Yuseol directly in front of her, pondering how to start the conversation. She realized that a mere human boy would not dare to speak first in front of the Elf King, so she decided to take the lead. However, the boy seemed completely at ease.

"Would you like some coffee? Or perhaps green tea?" he asked, fiddling with a coffee pot, seemingly indifferent to her presence. Watching him seriously contemplate whether to add sugar to the coffee or not, she was left speechless.

She wasn't upset, just a bit intrigued. "I'll have green tea," she said.

"That's not possible. I've already made two cups of coffee."

"…Then I'll have coffee."

"By the way, it's iced coffee."

She frowned because she disliked cold coffee, but she wasn't cold-hearted enough to refuse what had already been prepared. "Here you go," Baek Yuseol said, handing her the iced coffee. Seeing her fiddling with the cup, he chuckled. He knew she disliked iced coffee, but this was one of the best ways to pique her interest, even in the original game.

In most dating simulation games, you increase affection by giving the other person something they like. However, in Aither World Online, you could increase affection several times over by doing something the other person disliked first and then following it up with something better. Baek Yuseol didn't intend to date Kkot Seorin, but he thought this was the best way to open her heart for a conversation.

As Kkot Seorin glanced at Baek Yuseol sipping his iced coffee, she noticed a familiar scent emanating from him. The aura of the divine leaf, Iphanel? Yes, but more importantly...

"…You have the same cursed scent as I do."

"Yes, that's correct."

Indeed, the same 'scent of curse' that had forced Kkot Seorin to live in hiding all these years was also present in Baek Yuseol. But it was strange. Baek Yuseol walked around openly, yet people didn't fall in love with him and die from lovesickness.

"Have you… overcome the curse?"

Baek Yuseol realized his guess was correct. 'She doesn't even know she was blessed by Yeon Hongchun Samwol.' There were few records about Kkot Seorin in the Jikbakguri Glasses. One of his theories was that Kkot Seorin had no memory of Yeon Hongchun Samwol.

"Well, if you can call it overcoming…"

"Really? How… Please, teach me!"

Her trembling hands clasped his tightly as she pleaded. She looked desperate and pitiful, but Baek Yuseol hadn't actually overcome the curse himself. When Kkot Seorin was blessed, Yeon Hongchun Samwol's power was so overwhelming that it failed to control it, resulting in an excessive power that turned into a curse of enchantment for Kkot Seorin. However, by the time Baek Yuseol received the blessing, Yeon Hongchun Samwol had weakened significantly, so he didn't receive much of the enchantment power. He only gained mental fortitude and some ability to read others' minds.

"Well, there is a way."

"…Really?"

He wasn't sure, but he knew that using Yeon Hongchun Samwol's blessing could offset the curse. The Jikbakguri Glasses had vague records about it, and even in the original game, the scenes of resolving the curse were mostly skipped. Despite this, he was confident that he could use the blessing to remove the curse. Kkot Seorin was a minor character in the original game, but she was a person of great virtue and ability, too valuable to leave as she was. There was no guarantee that Flame would save her as in the original game, so he had to take matters into his own hands.

"It's not common for an ordinary student to have a private audience with the Elf King. So, we need to make the most of this opportunity."

"If it's not too much trouble, could you remove your mask?"

"That…"

Kkot Seorin hesitated, but they both knew that her curse had no effect on Baek Yuseol. Recalling their previous encounter, she slowly touched her face. She removed the layers of masks and veils, revealing her face protected by magic. Her snow-white hair, resembling the snowflakes of the Iceberg Mountains, cascaded down her neck. Her golden eyes, like the North Star, shone brightly, making one feel as if they were being drawn in.

Her beauty was overwhelming, almost too much for any sentient being to handle. However, due to the curse of [Yeonjeong Heupin Jiche], she had to hide her face from the world. Baek Yuseol, facing her, was momentarily breathless.

"…Ah, the curse is still…"

Seeing Baek Yuseol's reaction, Kkot Seorin thought it was impossible to escape the curse and hurriedly reached for her mask, but he stopped her.

"No, the curse seems fine."

"…Really?"

Even her cautious question was beautiful. "Yes, truly."

The curse had little effect. The problem was that her face was so captivating that it made the curse seem irrelevant. Her face, combined with the curse, was classified as an 'S-rank mass-murder trait' in the original game. Just standing there with her face exposed would cause people to die of lovesickness. Moreover, this was her 'neutral form.' In this form, elves do not exhibit distinct gender characteristics. Even without much sexual appeal, her beauty was overwhelming. If she were to fall for Flame and transform into a man as in the original game…

It was a bit terrifying. Even ordinary men might fall for her.

"As I expected," Baek Yuseol said suddenly, causing Kkot Seorin to widen her eyes. He continued with a serious expression, pretending to have anticipated everything.

"I entered the space of the divine beast and met Yeon Hongchun Samwol. I received a blessing directly from him."

"Ah… I see…"

"But you also have the same aura. That means… you must have already received Yeon Hongchun Samwol's blessing."

"…What?"

Kkot Seorin's reaction was one of complete surprise. It was painful to see. The solution to the curse might have been closer than she thought.

"The method is simple. Either Yeon Hongchun Samwol retrieves the blessing you received, or if that's not possible, you share it with me."

"…I see. You already know how to overcome this curse."

That's not it. But he pretended to know, clasping his hands and resting his chin on them. It looked impressive.

"〇 Uh…"

Kkot Seorin's fingertips trembled slightly, and her eyes wavered. It was the look of someone who had found hope. Though it wasn't felt here, her heart must be pounding wildly. If what the boy in front of her said was true…

She could finally reveal her face and step out into the world. She wouldn't have to sneak through the forest at dawn to relieve her frustration. She could walk proudly through the city, freely converse with people, exchange sincere glances, and be loved by everyone. She could live as an ordinary person.

"I want to break this curse as soon as possible."

"I think so too. If you want, we can go right now."

"No, that's not possible."

"…What?"

Baek Yuseol was a bit taken aback by her refusal.

"That would be too selfish. I didn't come here just for that. I wanted to properly apologize for my mistakes and, if there's time, talk about my old friend."

"Ah."

Indeed. She didn't come just to ask about the curse. In that sense, she was remarkable. Despite the hellish curse she had endured for hundreds of years, she maintained a strict sense of priority. If it were Baek Yuseol, he might have dropped everything to resolve the curse immediately.

Kkot Seorin glanced at the clock on the wall and smiled softly. There was no rush. After all, the boy who had overcome the same curse was right in front of her. There was no need to hurry. She would surely regret not cherishing this time later. So, she decided to enjoy her tea time with him slowly. She still disliked iced coffee, but she thought she might enjoy it with Baek Yuseol.

The adjacent room to the reception room was a waiting area where subordinates waited while their masters conversed. Since Kkot Seorin was in the reception room, her best magic knights were supposed to be on guard in the waiting room. However, she had sent them all away. She didn't want the curse to affect them while she removed her mask inside.

Despite this, one person remained. Orenha stayed, waiting for Kkot Seorin. He tapped his thigh with his fingers, counting the time. Despite the long wait, they showed no sign of coming out. He felt jealous and frustrated but endured it. The Elf King wouldn't suddenly fall for a teenage boy.

The Queen had ordered him to leave, but he didn't. A man who leaves just because a woman tells him to is not attractive. Orenha, who had been in several relationships for cover, prided himself on his knowledge of romance. He planned to apologize to Kkot Seorin and discuss future plans once she finished her conversation with Baek Yuseol. He wanted to prove his competence and make her trust him again. After all, Kkot Seorin couldn't move freely outside due to the curse. 'Your Majesty, you can't do anything without me.'

He believed that no matter what mistakes he made, she would have no choice but to rely on him. That was their fate. So, he endured the waiting. Finally, as evening fell and the sun set completely, the door opened, and they walked out.

"Your Majesty!" Orenha stood up with a bright face to greet the Queen. Then, he froze in place. 'What?' His Queen had removed her mask. The familiar yet distant beautiful face he had only seen in dreams. She smiled brightly at the boy but stiffened when she saw him. 'Why?'

It was a curious thing. Even with Kkot Seorin's face in front of him, another question arose in his mind. 'Why did she show her bare face, which she never showed me, to a mere human?' As jealousy filled his mind, he found himself approaching her unconsciously.

"Your Majesty, why…"

Why did you show that beautiful face and smile, which you never showed me, to that human? As he reached out with all those questions in mind, Kkot Seorin stepped back with a wary expression.

"…Don't come any closer."

"Ah…"

Shocked, Orenha stopped in his tracks. At that moment, the world tilted, and he collapsed to the floor. His vision darkened. He could no longer think.
