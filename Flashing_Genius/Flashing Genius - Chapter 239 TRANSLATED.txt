# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 239: The Witch (6)

At least once, you might have had such an experience. While doing homework that needs to be submitted by tomorrow, you fall asleep on your desk... and end up in an unusually deep sleep. You might feel like you only closed your eyes for a moment, but when you open them, the atmosphere feels off.

The chirping of sparrows, the warm sunlight, the flow of the quiet morning air. It feels refreshing. As your mind gradually clears, you start to think. Have you ever slept so deeply before? And then, you realize.

'Oh no!'

You haven't finished the homework that needs to be submitted today!

Flame was in exactly that situation.

'Huh.'

It only took a very brief moment for her mind to clear. And then she realized something was off.

'What is it?'

She couldn't figure out what it was yet. The memories of the previous day weren't coming back properly. So, Flame unconsciously reached out her hand. When she touched something warm, her whole body stiffened.

'Huh...?'

What did I do last night? She hadn't drunk any alcohol, but she had been so tired lately that she fell asleep instantly, making her memories blurry. But one thing was certain.

'Did I return to the dormitory yesterday...?'

No. No, she didn't. According to her last memory, she had sneaked into Baek Yuseol's dormitory. While waiting for him, she thought it would be better to lie down on the soft bed since he wasn't coming...

Startled, she tried to lift her upper body, but something heavy was on her stomach, making her pause. It was Baek Yuseol's arm.

"Snore..."

"Crazy...!"

She couldn't believe it. He was sleeping right next to her, not caring that she was lying in his bed. And he was even dressed neatly in his pajamas. Carefully moving his arm aside, she quietly got out of bed and crawled out.

Thud!

"Ouch!"

She accidentally stubbed her toe on the desk, but fortunately, Baek Yuseol didn't wake up.

'Ugh, what a mess...'

Flame liked wandering around the dormitory, but she had never spent the night in a male student's dormitory. And the fact that it was Baek Yuseol made her even more anxious.

Click!

Trying to make as little noise as possible, she quietly opened the door and left his dormitory, finally letting out a sigh of relief. It might not mean much, but if Baek Yuseol suddenly woke up here, it would create the worst atmosphere.

"Phew... Ugh... What a fool I am."

She wanted to mess up her hair in frustration but held back, fearing it would get tangled.

'I still have to go to school.'

No matter how embarrassing the situation, she couldn't forget her duty as a student. As she quietly turned to head back to her dormitory, she unfortunately ran into someone who used the nearby dormitory. It was Pung Harang.

"...Flame?"

"Oh, uh, hi."

He was in his gym clothes, drinking water in the hallway, probably just back from his morning exercise.

"Did you... by any chance..."

As Pung Harang started to say something, Flame quickly intercepted and blurted out anything.

"Oh, right! I have something urgent to do! See you in class!"

"Oh, okay..."

As Flame, who had shouted like a machine gun, disappeared with quick steps, Pung Harang blankly stared at her back, then turned his gaze to where she had been standing. Baek Yuseol's dormitory. Those two seemed to have a special bond that he didn't know about. So, there was no need for him to meddle in something he knew nothing about. Pung Harang soon left. It seemed his morning exercise wasn't over yet.

### Morning Class

"The lines connecting the nodes of a magic circle must be straight. As the angles of the nodes differ by 30, 45, or 60 degrees, it greatly affects the mana circulation rate. If there's even a 1-degree error in the angle, it can cause serious errors."

Theory classes are always boring. Although the second semester was supposed to focus on practice and training, theory classes still took up a significant portion. The practical part had only slightly increased compared to the first semester, but continuous theory study was still necessary.

Flame stared blankly at the blackboard. She still couldn't forget what happened in the morning.

'...Was I always like this?'

Her personality was quite cool and straightforward. It wasn't just her saying it; everyone around her said so, and she agreed. Sharing a bed? She could brush it off easily. They didn't do anything; they just slept. So why did it keep bothering her? She couldn't understand.

"Now, before we look at how the shape changes according to the number of nodes, let me ask a question. What is known as the most flammable material in the magic world?"

"Me!"

"Correct."

"Huh?"

None of the lesson content was sinking in. As Flame stared blankly at the blackboard, someone next to her tapped her shoulder.

"Hey."

"Huh? Oh, nothing..."

"We're going to karaoke tonight. Want to come?"

Flame, known for her singing, usually joined her friends at karaoke, rarely refusing due to her love for belting out songs.

"Um... I'm a bit tired today."

"Really?"

But today, she didn't feel like it, so she declined, making her friend look at her with a curious expression.

"Did you get rejected?"

"No?"

"Then, did you get confessed to?"

"What are you talking about..."

"I heard you've been hanging out with Baek Yuseol lately. Did you get back together?"

"No..."

She didn't know where such rumors came from, but Flame didn't care.

'...Really?'

Ding-dong-dang!

As the bell signaling the end of class rang, Flame walked out into the hallway with her friends as usual. They weren't in the same class or taking the same lessons, but it had become a habit to move together like this.

Stella's students had various ways to spend their leisure time during breaks. Some strolled through the sky garden chatting with friends, some girls elegantly enjoyed tea time on the starlight terrace, and others gathered in the gym to play sports or engage in brain training.

Flame was quite ordinary, usually enjoying chatting with friends in the garden or a caf√©.

"Flame? Did something bad happen today?"

"...Something bad?"

Not really. Maybe something embarrassing.

"Then why do you look so serious? You look really troubled."

"Really...?"

Was there something serious enough for her to worry about? The morning incident was just an embarrassing mishap, wasn't it?

'...Just a mishap?'

Thinking about it, it felt strange. Would an ordinary boy lie down next to a girl sleeping defenselessly in his bed? If it were him...

Normally, he would move the girl to the bed or sleep on the sofa himself. Although she knew the above scenario was quite a nuisance... Anyway, she had already made a mistake, and in that situation, Baek Yuseol didn't make that choice. Or, maybe...

'Is he used to sleeping next to me...?'

As she thought that far, her friends poked her in the side, bringing her back to reality.

"Hey, look over there."

"It's the Stella Knights."

"Huh?"

Wondering what they were talking about, she looked out at the terrace of the sky garden. Dozens of knights were marching in perfect formation across the bridge that crossed the center of Stella. Seeing the magical horses flying above them and the magical lights around their bodies, it was clear they were equipped with impressive gear, raising a question.

'Why would the knights be dispatched at this time?'

It didn't seem like an official deployment ceremony, so it looked like they were being sent on a small mission. But was there such a need recently?

'Well, I don't know everything.'

Even though she had read the original novel, the story in the book was centered around Eisel. She didn't know everything outside of that narrative, so there was no need to question such trivial matters.

But. There was someone quite noticeable among them.

"...Hey. Isn't that Baek Yuseol?"

"Yeah. It is."

"What? Really? I can't see well because of my bad eyesight."

"Yeah. It's true."

Baek Yuseol. The boy in Stella's uniform was leading the procession at the front of the knights. It was already strange enough that the knights and that boy were moving together, but he was even at the forefront.

'What on earth is happening?'

Flame's mind was filled with confusion, unable to grasp the situation.

* * *

"...What did you just say?"

The hands of the girls drinking tea froze. How long had it been since Princess Hong Biyeon spoke in such a cold voice? She was always quiet and aloof, but she wasn't someone who got angry often, so they needed to be even more cautious.

As the girls having tea with Hong Biyeon cautiously watched, Yeterin regretted her timing of the report and continued.

"Yes. It seems Baek Yuseol has been temporarily assigned to the Stella Knights for a mission."

"...Really? What does that have to do with me? You don't need to report unnecessary things."

As Hong Biyeon said that and closed her eyes, Yeterin spoke softly.

"I thought it might be something that would concern you, Princess. If not, I will skip the next report."

As Yeterin bowed and turned to leave, Hong Biyeon stopped her a beat later.

"No. Wait. I should at least hear it."

"...Is that so?"

Yeterin smiled inwardly and gave a signal, making the girls stand up and leave. They would probably feel quite grateful to Yeterin.

"According to what I've heard, the commander of the Arain Knights personally asked for his help to solve a mysterious incident occurring in Arcanium recently."

"The commander of the Arain Knights, personally...?"

Hong Biyeon trusts Yeterin. She had been the only one by her side since childhood. But even Yeterin's words had things she could believe and things she couldn't. For instance... No matter how she thought about it, this report didn't make sense.

The monster magician Arain, who was expected to become the next 9th-class magician, personally asking a mere first-year student for help? She had met him a few times and knew his personality well. Arain's pride was sky-high and would never bow to anyone. For him to ask a student for help...

"Does that mean he can't solve the incident with his own power, but that commoner can?"

"That seems to be the case."

"Hmm..."

Hong Biyeon knew a bit about Baek Yuseol's true nature, but others didn't. So, she felt Arain's insight was quite impressive. He had recognized Baek Yuseol's value purely through his insight and reached out to him. But. That was that.

"...I don't like it."

"What did you say?"

"Nothing."

She downed her tea in one go and stood up abruptly.

'He hasn't forgotten our promise, has he?'

Of course not. That promise was still the most vivid memory in Hong Biyeon's heart and would remain an eternal memory. Baek Yuseol would feel the same. She believed so.
