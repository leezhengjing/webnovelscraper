# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 174

## Chapter 40: The Seventh Main Tower (5)

Jeremy never does anything that results in a loss. In other words, he never does anything for others. To explain further, he only moves for his own benefit. He has never sacrificed himself for anyone in his entire life. He has always been like that, and he will continue to be so in the future. Even if the person in question is Flame, that won't change. Sacrifice for a loved woman? What does that even mean? In the end, if I can't have it, it's all meaningless.

'How foolish...'

Surrounded by ghosts and shadows, Jeremy closed his eyes and immersed himself in his own world. Ghosts do not exert direct physical force. What makes them terrifying is their ability to shatter the mental strength of intelligent beings. They stimulate negative emotions such as despair, chaos, fear, and sadness, turning a person into a complete wreck. That is the true power of these ghosts. However, all of that meant nothing to Jeremy. He had his own solid mental framework, allowing intrusion but not emotional disturbance. It felt like floating on a calm lake. Being surrounded by ghosts wasn't such a bad feeling.

'This should be enough.'

Although he didn't do something as foolish as sacrificing himself for Flame, he thought he had at least achieved the purpose of helping her. Jeremy closed his eyes to rest until this situation was over. He sank into the swamp of his own consciousness.

"Principal!"

Bang! The door to the principal's office burst open rudely, and two or three staff members rushed in. However, the office was already filled with staff who had come to see Principal Eltman Eltwin.

"Sir, it's a disaster! Students wandering around the main tower are going missing!"

Despite repeated warnings to students about the mysterious disappearances, telling them not to wander alone and to always be accompanied by staff or get permission, it was useless. The faculty couldn't protect all the students, and even groups of students were disappearing all at once.

"This is... truly a disaster."

Stella was facing an unprecedented crisis. Students were disappearing one by one into unknown spaces, and the school had no idea why or how to respond. Eltman raised his head, his face shadowed. The immense pressure made everyone, including the faculty, shrink back. But even in such a situation, they had to speak.

"Principal... the culprit is deliberately avoiding the faculty and targeting the students. We must find a way to stop it quickly..."

A way to stop it. If there was such a thing, they would have done it already. The culprit's goal was obvious. Half a century ago, there was a student at Stella... Abelain Staberk, who had the trait [Magic Absorption]. It was an unprecedented trait that allowed one to make another's magic their own, but the penalties were so severe that its use was heavily restricted. But what if he could properly handle that trait? What if he absorbed all the magic of the twelve disciples, to whom the progenitor mage had divided his magic into twelve pieces? What would happen then? Perhaps a power strong enough to oppose the progenitor mage would be born.

The student had big dreams and ambitions from a young age. Eltman tried to correct Abelain's dangerous thoughts and imposed countless restrictions, but he kept causing trouble and eventually dropped out. On the day he dropped out, Abelain said, "Principal, you won't be able to stop me. You will be betrayed by everything you believe in."

And now, fifty years later, he was being tormented by the legacy left behind fifty years ago.

'He plans to absorb the magic of the twelve disciples' descendants.'

Currently, there were two descendants of the twelve disciples enrolled at Stella. Hong Biyeon Adolevit and Angel Morf. Their magic seemed like ordinary fire and ice attribute magic, but since it was left by the progenitor mage, it had very special potential. However, even Abelain himself couldn't properly handle the trait [Magic Absorption], so how could a fragment of his soul absorb magic properly? It was absolutely impossible.

'He has another goal.'

Yes. He could probably succeed in absorbing the magic. But if that happened, the 'fragmented soul' would completely disappear. However, the descendants of the twelve disciples would lose their magic entirely, which would be a significant gain for Abelain. He hated the progenitor mage more than anyone else.

'The progenitor mage is wrong. The world, society, system, and laws he created, along with the past and future, are all wrong.'

Eltman stood up and flicked his fingers. A robe hanging on a coat rack flew over and draped itself over his shoulders.

"Principal, are you finally taking action?"

"I'm going to do my job."

"As expected...!"

Whatever they expected, he wasn't going to stop the Seventh Main Tower incident. Instead, he planned to resolve the external issues. After causing such a situation, the rats hiding in the shadows... he would deal with them.

* * *

The rooftop of the Seventh Main Tower. The space, open on all sides and supported by twelve pillars with a dome, was once called the 'Stella Balcony.' The instruments and star maps left behind for observing constellations were proof of that. Professor Raiden observed the sky of the Seventh Main Tower through a mirror. He hadn't crossed over to the other world, but he continued to watch everything happening there.

"Are you uneasy?"

The mirror spoke. Professor Raiden did not answer.

"Are you afraid?"

"...Yes."

This time, he answered. He wasn't uneasy. Everything would proceed as planned. In that world, the two descendants of the twelve disciples and Flame would have their bodies and minds completely taken over by Abelain's fragmented soul. The girls, who dreamed of a bright future and lived the most beautiful lives, would be shattered here.

Abelain's fragmented soul said, "It's just a sacrifice for the greater good." But could those girls really be called 'sacrifices'? As a dark mage, all magic should be hated and checked. Magic was the decisive cause that led the world to the path of destruction. All of this was for the future. For the world. That was why Professor Raiden was loyal to the 'Dark Mage Cult Leader.'

"You seem to be overthinking."

"Not really."

"You need to meet me."

"May I ask why?"

"Because you are like me."

He paused for a moment.

"We must not hesitate. Do you feel sorry for the young girls? If you think so, drop everything and leave this place immediately. You must uproot all the weeds to prevent them from growing again. Those girls are just weeds that are eating away at the world."

"Yes, I understand."

"So do your job. Eltman Eltwin must have noticed by now. You should hurry."

"...Understood."

Professor Raiden turned and left the hall. Abelain's fragmented soul, watching his back, turned back to his own world.

"Hahaha! Hahaha! Hihihik!"

Professor Checkiren, a fool of a dark mage, burst into laughter. He couldn't contain his joy at the thought of absorbing the power of both Adolevit and Morf.

"Foolish girls! Come on, come!"

The Star Child, unaware of anything, was leading another descendant of the twelve disciples here. They would face many cursed legends on their way, but as the Star Child, they would overcome all the hardships and finally reach here. However, what awaited them at the end was not hope but endless despair.

"...Blame your 'past life.' It was your previous life's actions that drove you to this harsh fate."

"This wretched life ends today! Haha!"

Professor Checkiren laughed, imagining his future. With Angel and Flame, and countless other students entering the Seventh Main Tower at this moment, if he absorbed all their potential, he could hold the ultimate power. ...Or so he thought. It was a blatant lie. Professor Checkiren was just a puppet of Abelain, who couldn't act on his own. His body would explode the moment he absorbed the magic of another descendant of the twelve disciples and the 'Star Child.' With their demise, he too would disappear from this world forever. But if it brought the true 'me' one step closer to the goal...

Hmm? But something felt off. What was this... an alien presence that was hard to describe in human words? It felt like it didn't belong to this world. Such an absurd presence had entered the Seventh Main Tower.

'This presence is like...!'

It clearly existed in this world, yet it didn't. What kind of nonsensical explanation was this? Human language was so trivial and insignificant. 'Something is wrong.' That thought crossed his mind, but it was already too late. The presence had already entered the Seventh Main Tower. It moved quickly through the space as if it had been here before, using hidden paths that even Abelain, the master of the Seventh Main Tower, didn't know about. Very quickly, at lightning speed, it was approaching this place.

'No need to panic.'

Fate was already decided.

Clang!

"Oh, finally here!"

The door to the Stella Balcony opened, and the girls Professor Checkiren had been waiting for finally appeared. Their uniforms were in tatters, and they were drenched in sweat, clearly exhausted, but their eyes shone brightly. They had no intention of giving up here. Flame limped in and stood before Checkiren. Angel and Anella stood proudly beside her, their determination evident.

"Hmm! I like the look in your eyes! I'd love to pluck them out and display them. But..."

Checkiren, who had been speaking with satisfaction, frowned when he saw Anella standing behind them.

"Aren't you one of 'us'? Why are you there? Come over here, no... actually, it's better this way. Defeat those girls. In return for saving me the trouble, I'll share my 'power' with you."

Flinch. Anella trembled at Checkiren's words. Power. The problem was his power. In the dark mage society, everything was decided by power, and Anella, who had only one special trait, was treated worse than trash. If she had power... she could live proudly. If she defeated Flame and Angel here, gained power, and then killed Baek Yuseol? She would surely have a bright future as a dark mage.

"...No."

But Anella spoke with determined eyes.

"I choose to live as a 'human,' even if it means being miserable."

Checkiren fell silent. He looked dumbfounded, as if he had heard something wrong, and then burst into laughter.

"Human? Human? Live as a human? After becoming a dark mage? Do you think it's possible to return to being human? You fool!"

Of course, it was impossible. There had never been a precedent of a dark mage returning to being human. But Anella firmly believed.

"No. It's possible."

Baek Yuseol himself had said so. Although there was no evidence, his words carried weight, and Anella trusted him completely. She stepped forward and stood in front of Flame and Angel, as if to protect them.

"I will prove my sincerity."

Anella had discovered another talent while navigating the Seventh Main Tower. The destructive power in her seemingly insignificant punches and kicks. But...

'It's not enough.'

She would surely lose. The opponent exuded infinite power, while she only had slightly stronger but still clumsy punches. Even so, she believed. Even if she had fallen now, if she repented and did the right thing to atone for her sins... she would surely see the light someday. With a determined expression, Anella raised her fist and spoke confidently to the high-ranking dark mage she once had to kneel before.

"So come at me, dark mage."

Even if she knew she would fail today, she would never give up.
