## Chapter 204: Gambling with Time (7)

**Shiyue, Yin Shiyue.** His ability to simultaneously view the past, present, and future, to rewind, fast-forward, or even stop time, is truly unique among the Shiyue.

"Well then, what is your favorite poker game?" asked Yin Shiyue, who had a long white beard like an immortal, to Bai Yuseol.

Without hesitation, as if he had prepared in advance, Bai Yuseol replied, "Seven-card stud."

"Seven-card stud, huh." It was one of the most famous poker games and, in Korea, where Bai Yuseol once lived, it was synonymous with poker itself. The reason he chose this game was simple. Was it because it was easier to win against someone who could manipulate time? Not at all. It was simply because it was the only poker game whose rules he knew.

Bai Yuseol was a novice at poker, to the extent that he had to check the hand rankings through his glasses. The important point here is that in seven-card stud, players receive cards one at a time and start betting, but they rarely touch the cards. In other words, card switching is impossible. Even if he tried to show the cards briefly, the mana sensors and the Garam tribe guards watching from all sides would catch him immediately.

"Shall we start the game right away?" The dealer approached and asked cautiously. He wasn't looking at Bai Yuseol but at Yin Shiyue, the tyrant of the Lotus Inn.

"Sure, what's the stake?"

"One million."

"Ha ha ha. You will have an interesting experience at such a young age."

Following Bai Yuseol, Yin Shiyue also placed his stake on the table. "Deal the cards."

The game began. The dealer carefully dealt three cards each to Bai Yuseol and Yin Shiyue across the long table. After checking their hands, both players revealed all three cards. At this point, the outcome was half decided. Some might get a good hand from the start, while others might get a bad hand that can't form a decent hand even after receiving four more cards.

'Poker face.' It means hiding one's emotions to avoid revealing their hand. For Bai Yuseol, who had the blessing of Yeon Hongchun Samwol, it was easy to maintain a poker face, but Yin Shiyue was different. He kept smiling and revealed one card, and Bai Yuseol followed suit.

"I will deal the cards." As the dealer revealed one card at a time, he dealt another card to each player. After revealing the newly received card, the betting began. Bai Yuseol examined his cards and declared "half," betting half of the stake.

"Hmm..." Yin Shiyue scrutinized Bai Yuseol's expression but found no clues. For now, he had no choice but to bet. "Call."

The game progressed quickly. Neither Bai Yuseol nor Yin Shiyue hesitated to bet large sums, and the dealer, sweating profusely, dealt the cards quickly.

"Call, 4 million."

"Call, 8 million."

The dealer, who prided himself on having seen many high-stakes games, had never seen such a match. 'What kind of guts does that student have?' Seeing him casually throw in such a huge stake, it was clear he was from a famous noble family. But even so, wasn't it too much money to lose as a life lesson?

Unlike his usual cautious self, Yin Shiyue was recklessly betting large sums, barely glancing at his cards. As the seven cards were dealt and the game reached its climax, with the stakes sky-high, the cards were revealed.

Bai Yuseol's hand: back straight.
Yin Shiyue's hand: two pair.
'Bai Yuseol wins.'

Yin Shiyue stroked his beard. 'I lost.' In a situation where he had no choice but to lose all the money he had bet, Yin Shiyue closed his eyes and then opened them again.

**...Half.** Five minutes ago. The moment Bai Yuseol made his first bet. In other words, he refocused on the 'present.' His future self had lost. So, he would act differently here.

"Fold." Was there any need to bet on a game he had already lost? Bai Yuseol, who thought he had a good hand, was helpless when Yin Shiyue folded. The next game was the same.

"Double!"

"...Fold."

"Raise!"

"...Fold."

"Ha ha ha. Good, good."

Yin Shiyue's strategy was simple. By 'simultaneously observing' the present and the future, he confirmed the outcome in the future and acted differently in the present. Whenever Bai Yuseol had an advantage, Yin Shiyue folded, and when he had an advantage, he bet big to take Bai Yuseol's money.

'This game is impossible.'

'Even if he's a Stella, a child can't beat the best gambler.'

Yin Shiyue was known as the tyrant of the Lotus Inn. No one could defeat him in a card game, and his magical prowess was so strong that it was impossible to drive him out by force. Whenever he visited, he forced card games and drained the inn's money before escaping. He was more of a gangster than a tyrant.

So, when a young student challenged him without knowing anything, he must be shedding tears of blood by now...

'Hmm?'

'What is this?'

Everyone present felt the same doubt simultaneously. "Call." Despite losing nearly half his money, Bai Yuseol continued the game with a calm expression.

'Does that amount of money mean nothing to him?' If he were a tremendous rich man, it would make sense, but even the wealthiest people would show signs of distress when the game started to go against them. However, Bai Yuseol maintained a relaxed attitude throughout. Was it really that losing money didn't matter to him, or...

"Raise!" When Yin Shiyue pushed in his coins with a strong bet, the Garam tribe guards watching shook their heads, sweating.

'He's doing it again.'

Even though he had only received two cards, it meant he was confident of victory. Whenever Yin Shiyue made such a bet, he always won, so this time would be no different. But then, Bai Yuseol, instead of countering, rested his chin on his hand and said to the dealer, "Dealer, could you shuffle the cards before dealing the next one?"

"What? What?"

"There's no reason not to, right?"

"Well, um..."

"Wait! What do you mean by that?" Yin Shiyue finally spoke up, flustered.

"Is there a need to shuffle the cards? We can proceed as is."

"I'm not shuffling them; the dealer is. Is there a problem?"

"Well, that's true, but..."

Yin Shiyue, who had never experienced this before, was greatly flustered. This game was supposed to end with him getting a full house and Bai Yuseol getting a straight. However, in the 'observed future,' there was no case where the dealer shuffled the cards. If the cards were shuffled now, after he had already bet a large sum...

The result would be unpredictable, even for Yin Shiyue. Even if he tried to peek into the future again, it was too late. Yin Shiyue couldn't reverse events that had already occurred... 'Time regression' was impossible.

"I will reveal the cards."

Bai Yuseol: back straight.
Yin Shiyue: triple.
'I lost.'

Bai Yuseol's hand had improved, while Yin Shiyue's hand had plummeted. "Ha ha. This is a first." Having never experienced such a thing, Yin Shiyue chuckled. A 'variable' had entered the game, altering the future. As Bai Yuseol swept up Yin Shiyue's money, he said, "You originally had a good hand."

"Hmm? Yes, that was the plan."

"But I shuffled the cards, breaking your hand."

"Well... that's true."

But that was an event that happened in the future. Bai Yuseol couldn't have known that, yet he spoke as if he had seen the same scene. "Let's resume the game."

The same pattern repeated. Whenever Bai Yuseol had a good hand, Yin Shiyue folded, and whenever Yin Shiyue had a good hand, Bai Yuseol requested a shuffle. However, there was no guarantee that Bai Yuseol would win just because he introduced the 'shuffle' variable. There were plenty of cases where Bai Yuseol lost even in the unpredictable future.

Conversely, there were also plenty of cases where Yin Shiyue lost. Neither of them was particularly skilled at poker. In terms of psychological warfare or technical skills, they were no different from ordinary people. In other words, they were purely playing seven-card stud.

'This is...'

Yin Shiyue clicked his tongue. The future was constantly fluctuating. Do you know the term 'butterfly effect'? It's so well-known that I'll skip the explanation and get to the point: every little action Bai Yuseol took caused a butterfly effect. The future is not fixed. Depending on the events in the present, countless possibilities and probabilities arise, and the future unfolds accordingly. But when 'chance' intervenes, even Yin Shiyue can't predict the future.

For example, let's say you put three dice in a cup and shake it to play 'even or odd.' Inside the cup, the dice hit the walls and each other, creating countless 'possibilities.' When chance upon chance upon chance upon chance overlaps, countless events occur. 3, 4, 1. 2, 6, 6. 1, 3, 2. Even if you see the same future, thousands or tens of thousands of futures arise, making it impossible for Yin Shiyue to predict the outcome of the dice roll five minutes later.

The ability to simultaneously observe the present and the future. It sounds like a great ability, but it's merely the ability to 'calculate probabilities'... nothing more, nothing less. Time is too vast and grand for a single being to control. When you think of the Shiyue, you might think of them as 'beings that control specific attributes.' Qingdong Shiyue controls ice. Chihayue controls fire. Yeon Hongchun Samwol controls the mind. But...

That's a misconception. They don't control attributes. They simply understand the flow of those attributes better than anyone else.

"Call and double."

"Ugh..."

No one can match Yin Shiyue's understanding of time... unless the opponent is someone who fully understands time travelers. Bai Yuseol caused countless coincidences even in a single game. Betting without looking at his cards, asking for a shuffle, or asking the Garam tribe watching the game to scatter the cards.

'The future has become unpredictable.'

The predetermined future kept changing. For Yin Shiyue, it was both terrifying and despairing. It felt like being dropped into the open sea with your limbs bound and your vision blocked. But at the same time... a thrilling excitement surged through him.

"Ha ha, I won!"

It was a game he was supposed to lose. But every time he bet, Bai Yuseol kept causing 'coincidences,' so Yin Shiyue used that to his advantage, bet big, and won. This too was a coincidence. He could have lost or won. He bet on an uncertain future and ended up winning.

"...I lost."

When Bai Yuseol put down his cards, Yin Shiyue chuckled and swept the mountain of coins towards himself. "Isn't this fun?"

"Yes, it's fun! With this money, I can drink a thousand-year-old Dongdongju to my heart's content!"

"Is that really why you're happy?"

"What?"

Yin Shiyue finally looked up and met Bai Yuseol's eyes. In his eyes... something mysterious passed by. Yin Shiyue thought it felt 'familiar.'

"I've always wanted to ask you something."

Yin Shiyue, who had been carelessly sweeping up the coins, put them down and slumped into his chair. Folding his arms, he nodded. "Ask away."

"Is the future of this world predetermined?"

"...It seems like you know who I am."

Yin Shiyue frowned as if he had a headache but soon sighed deeply. The other party's actions made it obvious. That arrogant human kid knew his identity and came to find him. So... he answered calmly.

"The future is predetermined."

Yin Shiyue could observe countless futures, and they branched into numerous timelines. However, no matter how many futures there were, the conclusion was always the same. 'This world will be destroyed in ten years.' All the countless futures were heading towards the same single endpoint. Towards the endpoint of destruction. A predetermined future cannot be stopped or reversed. Yin Shiyue was just someone who could swim a little better in the 'waterfall' called time. While others were swept away helplessly, he could struggle and struggle to swim against the waterfall with a slightly special ability. Changing the fact that the waterfall falls from top to bottom... was absolutely impossible.

So, Bai Yuseol asked again. "Is the future... really predetermined?"

"What?"

"Did you foresee your victory just now?"

No. He played poker with the feeling of discovering an uninhabited island while swimming in the vast sea of an uncertain future. "That's a difficult question."

Yin Shiyue. In exchange for the ability to reverse the flow of time, he realized the truth that 'a predetermined future cannot be changed.' From the moment he realized that truth, it became his shackle and curse, and he couldn't escape it for over a thousand years. But. If there was someone who could cause variables, like ripples in a calm lake... someone who could steer a predetermined future in a different direction? Even in a simple game like poker... if there was someone who could change the future, what then?

"The future is not predetermined."

At first glance, it might sound arrogant. How dare he talk about time to Yin Shiyue? But the old man nodded calmly at the boy's words. "I see... If I can't even predict the outcome of this simple poker game, what kind of Silver Time Shiyue am I?"

"I came here to gamble with you."

It was the first time in his life. An opponent whose outcome he couldn't predict even while gambling. The bet with him was bound to be a loss for Yin Shiyue. He had already changed the predetermined future, making the outcome unknown.

"The bet is simple."

This time, he proposed another bet. "In ten years, whether the world will be destroyed or not."

Ting! The boy flicked his last remaining coin to the old man. "I will go all-in on 'the world will not be destroyed.'"
