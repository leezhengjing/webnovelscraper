# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 183: Isolation (1)

Even in Aether World, where telephones were rare, the high-ranking individuals all had their own means of communication. However, the Elf King, Flower Serin, did not. This was because there was a risk of falling under a curse if one listened to her voice for an extended period.

"…Is that really true?"

"Yes."

Not anymore. Her curse had significantly weakened, and there was no longer any risk of falling into lovesickness just from hearing her voice. Thanks to this, Flower Serin could freely use the telephone and handle her own affairs, increasing her activity. Although the workload she had to handle increased, she said all the frustrations had disappeared.

"It's really fortunate that you managed to get the divine artifact right away. I was so worried because I couldn't go myself…"

"Well, what can you do when you're both beautiful and kind-hearted? I think there will still be people suffering from lovesickness even if the curse is gone. It wouldn't be strange if I were included in that. It's abnormal not to fall for someone so charming."

"…I don't particularly have any thoughts of dating right now."

Maybe that's why, despite being surrounded by so many attractive women, I hardly felt any romantic emotions. Most of them were too young, but the bigger reason was the mountain of tasks that needed immediate attention. I don't have some ridiculous sense of duty to save the world alone. I'm not that great of a person. I'm just struggling to survive.

"I'd like to bring the divine artifact right away and further alleviate the curse, but my schedule is currently overlapping…"

"It's okay. I've waited this long, so I can wait a bit more."

Saying that makes me feel like I should bring it sooner.

"Yes. I'll visit you soon."

"Stay healthy until then."

After ending the call with Flower Serin, I rummaged through my pocket and took out the broken pipe.

"Hmm… It's completely shattered."

This pipe's name is 'Specter's Wraith Talisman.' It was an artifact I obtained very easily, but in fact, it is an extremely rare high-grade magical tool even in Aether World. Although it's not an ancient relic or legendary grade, just possessing it grants the 'complete immunity to ghost-type attacks' trait, which is incredibly overpowered. However, it was now shattered. No matter how skilled I am, there was no way I could have entered the Mirror World to obtain the Flame without any risk. Absolutely not. The Constellation Project had exceptionally modified and enhanced the artifacts I possessed, and they had placed a special blessing on this 'Specter's Wraith Talisman.' Thanks to that, I could move freely in the Flame's world, but in return, I had to use up the overpowered talisman that could have lasted a lifetime in a single use.

Artifacts are relics from the ancient wizard era, so they cannot be repaired with modern technology.

"Still… Should I take it to Alterisha?"

In the original game, you could only request the production and repair of predetermined items, but since this is reality, they might entertain such an unreasonable request. Whether it can be repaired or not is a problem for later.

"It's a pity, but… I used it properly."

Since I could save Flame's life with just this artifact, the Specter's Wraith Talisman had done its job well. Still, thinking it might be repairable, I placed it in a special storage box.

Next, I checked my abilities for the first time in a long while.

### Baek Yuseol

**Stats**

**Skills**

**Traits**

- [Blessing of Yeonhongchun Samwol Lv.3]
- [Contractor of the Divine Beast Yiphanel]

Until now, growth had been quite slow, but thanks to the buffs from [Blessing of Yeonhongchun Samwol] and [Tae Ryung Shin Gong], growth had accelerated. By participating in the major episode [Black Horse Erosion] and completing the mission directly requested by the Constellation Project, I gained an enormous amount of growth experience. It wasn't just any reward; it was a 'very special reward.' This was the first time for such a case, so I was slightly excited. The reward list itself didn't seem much different from before, but there should be a bit more merit.

I pondered a lot here. Should I choose an item or increase my stats? Just increasing strength or agility would create an enormous synergy effect with Tae Ryung Shin Gong. However…

"Choosing Blink would be better."

Magic Leak Delay? Tae Ryung Shin Gong? Ultimately, the reason I could rampage as Baek Yuseol was because of Blink. No matter how skillfully I wield a sword, what good is it? Without Blink, I'd just be swept away by a few spells and die.

"Hmm… I'll choose number 2."

[Experience points are allocated to Blink.]

[Blink's level has increased!]

**Blink**

- Class: 3
- Maximum Range: 15m
- Maximum Charges: 3
- Cooldown: 3 seconds

Finally, the rank increased, but unfortunately, the maximum number of Blink charges did not increase. It can't be helped. This is one of the fundamental problems of the character Baek Yuseol. Compared to other characters, growth is extremely slow.

"Because of this, I almost quit several times."

When playing as characters like Mayuseong or Haewonryang, they achieve explosive growth according to their unique characteristics. Those two characters freely handle multiple attributes, so as their level increases, they gain additional attributes or learn explosive magic, making their growth very noticeable. But not Baek Yuseol. The Blink magic, no matter how great, only slightly increases the distance or very occasionally adds a charge.

Still… In the next stage, the maximum number of Blink charges will be 4, so I just need to endure a bit more. Although I won't be able to use Blink recklessly like in the original game, having 4 Blinks will completely change my mobility.

"I'll hold off on the second reward for now."

From the Black Horse Erosion onwards, the storyline branches depending on the choices, causing significant changes in the main episode. Some players smoothly transition to the second semester's story, while others experience another horror event called [Endless Summer Vacation], and some players advance their relationship with the male lead through the [Summer at the Sunny Beach] event. With hundreds and thousands of events existing, it was impossible to predict what episode would occur next. Since I didn't plan to wait idly, I organized the rewards neatly and stood up immediately. It's time to visit Flame.

* * *

Flame uses a single room. Originally, it was a place used by wealthy nobles, but thanks to her deep involvement in the recent incident and her significant contribution to resolving it, the faculty made an effort.

"Ah… Yes. I'm fine."

"Good. It's fortunate that you're not in pain. Let's have a meal together next time."

Not only the professors of Stella Academy but also the wizards of the Magic Tower occasionally visited Flame. She had garnered the attention of many wizards by leading and resolving the major incident known as the Seventh Tower Ghost Story. However, Flame found this attention burdensome.

"…It seemed nice in the dream."

In that world, she thrived on attention like a plant growing in the sun, enjoying popularity. It was a personality completely opposite to the real Flame.

"It's so annoying…"

How could she lie comfortably when professors were flocking to worry about her? After they left fruits and flowers and departed, Flame immediately sprawled on the bed.

Knock, knock!

But soon, a knock sounded, and she made a face of annoyance before forcing a smile for the guest.

"Yes~ Who is it~?"

The door opened, and the person who entered was neither a professor nor a wizard but Baek Yuseol.

"It's me."

"Oh, um…?"

It had been two days since she woke up. This was the first time Baek Yuseol visited her, so Flame's expression softened.

What kind of expression should she make? Should she smile? Get annoyed? Joke around? No, why was she even concerned about her expression when meeting someone like Baek Yuseol?

Flame's thought process was overloaded.

"Why is your reaction so lukewarm? Are you okay? It's not a terminal illness, right?"

"What… are you an idiot? It's just exhaustion…."

"Yeah. I actually know."

"…If you know, why ask? It's annoying."

Baek Yuseol knew better than anyone that the reason she collapsed and was hospitalized was due to severe mental fatigue. He pushed aside the pile of gifts on the table and placed the fruit basket he brought, then sat on Flame's bed. She subtly moved her hips inward to avoid him. It wasn't very noticeable.

"I was going to visit you, but there were too many people coming to see you. Do you remember what happened then?"

"Uh, um… It's a bit embarrassing, but I do remember."

She said, fidgeting with her fingers while looking down.

"That's my hometown."

Baek Yuseol probably already knew that her hometown was another world. She had never said it directly, but… in countless timelines, 'another me who loved him' must have told him.

"I know."

As expected, Baek Yuseol responded nonchalantly while peeling an apple. It was incredibly clumsy and messy, hard to believe he was someone who usually wielded a sword. But well, it's not like you eat an apple for its appearance.

"…You peeled it terribly."

But this was too much. It was truly the worst.

"Just eat it. They say the nutrients are in the peel."

Baek Yuseol munched on the apple. Crunch! For a while, the only sound in the hospital room was the crunching of apples. Baek Yuseol was engrossed in reading a newspaper he found on the table, while Flame was busy choosing her next words.

"Um…"

Finally, she spoke, and Baek Yuseol folded the newspaper and made eye contact.

'Oh, why is he listening so intently…'

She was just going to say something trivial, but his reaction made her hesitate.

"That world I dreamed of…"

"Yeah."

"That wasn't a real world, right?"

Baek Yuseol rested his chin on his hand and, after a brief silence, replied.

"I don't know."

"…Huh?"

"It could have been real, or it might not have been. But what's important is that by you returning, that world is now safe."

"I see…"

"If that world was real, they would remember you as a hero. The moment you sacrificed yourself, all the monsters in that world would have disappeared."

Baek Yuseol's words were simple. 'You saved that world, so don't blame yourself.' He accurately understood what part of her was troubled. Though he spoke in a roundabout way, his words were incredibly warm. With the conversation flowing, the awkward atmosphere gradually disappeared. They could exchange trivial jokes and make eye contact as before.

While they were passing time with idle chatter, a commotion was heard from the hallway as people rushed by.

"What's that?"

They tried to ignore it, but the atmosphere was too intense, so Baek Yuseol immediately got up to check the hallway.

"That's… the Phoenix Knights of Adolevit."

Hearing Flame's words, who had followed him, Baek Yuseol's expression turned serious. The entry of private soldiers into Stella was strictly prohibited unless under special circumstances. Moreover, the arrival of the royal family's Phoenix Knights could cause significant diplomatic friction.

"What on earth…"

Flame was puzzled as this didn't happen in the original story, but Baek Yuseol, who quickly grasped the situation, grew increasingly grim. Princess Hong Bi-yeon's future was predetermined. 'She dies on the day she graduates from Stella.' The cause was unknown, and the reason was unclear, plunging countless players into despair for ten years. Why did she have to die? If simply dying was the end, it might have been a relief. Depending on the player's choices, Hong Bi-yeon often met even worse endings. This was one of those cases.

'Hong Bi-yeon Exile Ending.'

Isolating her from society, imprisoning her, and slowly letting her wither away. Compared to the prison ending, social death ending, or execution ending, this was relatively better, but it was still wrong. Baek Yuseol chased after the departing Phoenix Knights. The ornate carriage at the forefront stood out. He watched the Adolevit royal family's carriage leave through Stella Academy's main gate for a long time. Was it just his imagination? He felt as if he made eye contact with someone beyond the darkened window.
