### The End of Summer (5)

In September, as summer comes to an end, Stella Academy's new term begins. Unlike other magic schools, Stella's opening ceremony is held in the grand hall rather than the sports field, and with 24-hour temperature control magic, there's no risk of anyone fainting from the heat. Even the principal's speech is extremely brief.

"Work hard in the fall."

That was all. 

"Ahem, next, the vice principal will..."

The speech was so short that Vice Principal Akihayden had to come out and fill the time. He had so much to say that he raised the students' sensitivity levels significantly with his lengthy address.

"...It's starting again."

Angel found herself surprisingly accustomed to Stella. Initially, she had enrolled with grand ambitions and lived in a state of constant tension, but now she could afford a bit of leisure. It felt like just yesterday that she had attended the entrance ceremony, and now it was already the second semester. The first semester of her first year had been filled with intense incidents, and even the summer vacation had been hectic, making time seem to fly by.

"I must study hard in the second semester too!"

Angel's determination was something that once made Flame question the plausibility of the original novel. While not everyone is like that, a typical high school student would likely feel more reluctant than motivated to work harder in the second semester. However, Flame herself was quite diligent in her studies, making her and Angel quite exceptional from Baek Yuseol's perspective.

"That concludes the opening ceremony."

After the ceremony, the students gathered in their respective classes. First-year S-Class had significantly fewer students compared to other classes, but it was filled with unique and genius students. And among them was Baek Yuseol. Unlike other classes, there was no excited, noisy atmosphere; instead, there was a quiet silence. In the midst of this, Baek Yuseol was lying on his desk, taking a nap on the first day of school. Angel naturally took a seat a few rows behind him, at a perfect distanceâ€”not too close, not too far, and not uncomfortable.

Creak...

After waiting for a while, the back door of the classroom opened, and Hong Biyeon entered. She first stared intently at Baek Yuseol lying down, then briefly made eye contact with Angel before quickly averting her gaze.

"What the heck..."

Since that day's incident, her hatred for Adolevit had deepened, but there was something strange about Hong Biyeon. She didn't particularly dislike her, but she didn't like her either.

Creak!

Unlike Hong Biyeon, who entered quietly, the front door of the classroom opened noisily, and Instructor Lee Hanwol entered. He scanned the classroom with his deep eyes, stopping at Baek Yuseol's seat and frowning. However, he soon went to the podium and spoke as if it didn't matter.

"It's been a while. Some of you may have spent the summer vacation idly, while others may not have. Starting from the second semester, we will begin proper practical training. As S-Class students, I expect none of you to have done nothing."

Flinch.

Baek Yuseol's body trembled as if feeling guilty, and he slowly raised his upper body. He stared blankly at Instructor Lee Hanwol with half-dead eyes.

"I don't care what you did during the vacation. But... before we start the practical classes of the second semester, there's one way to indirectly check your achievements."

Understanding his words, all the S-Class students took out their notebooks, reports, magic parchments, and handmade magic books. Angel was no exception.

"It's time to check your vacation homework."

Stella's vacation homework is in the form of reports. It's not just about solving problems; students might even write new theses or develop new magic or magical tools. The difficulty is high, but it's expected at Stella Academy. Each subject requires individual submission, but it seemed like Instructor Lee Hanwol wanted to check them all at once, so Angel prepared a few reports. Despite her busy schedule during the vacation, this level of homework was not difficult for her. Probably, for the excellent S-Class students of Stella, it was easier than eating cold porridge.

"...I'm doomed."

However, for some reason, Baek Yuseol, who was sitting a few rows ahead of Angel, buried his head in his hands.

"Huh...?"

Angel, curious, looked at his desk but saw nothing on it.

"Could it be...?"

As if confirming her suspicion, Baek Yuseol didn't take out anything even when Lee Hanwol slowly circled the classroom.

"Baek Yuseol, where is your homework?"

"I had a perfectly wonderful report prepared, but..."

"But?"

"I think I left it in the refrigerator. Should I go get it now?"

"Expect a special curriculum."

"Yes..."

Seeing Baek Yuseol getting scolded, Angel couldn't help but smile quietly. When Lee Hanwol returned to the podium, Angel subtly moved a few seats closer to Baek Yuseol. Previously, she had no reason to sit close to him, but now she had a reason.

"Excuse me."

"Huh? What?"

Baek Yuseol, with a half-dead expression, responded, and Angel handed him a spare notebook. It contained several magic circles she had doodled while studying, which had evolved into a completely new magic.

"Would you like this? It might save you from getting a penalty."

Despite her offer, she was slightly worried. Genius magicians often had strong self-esteem and high pride, so they usually refused to accept help from others, even if they made mistakes. If the same situation happened to Haewonryang or Hong Biyeon, they would probably write a new magic circle within five minutes rather than borrow someone else's homework.

"Well, if you don't want to..."

However, Baek Yuseol grabbed Angel's notebook without any hesitation.

"Thank you!"

"Huh?"

Angel was slightly taken aback by his enthusiastic reaction.

"I'll take this favor to my grave."

"No need for that..."

Although he was overly grateful, Angel felt a sense of satisfaction knowing she had helped Baek Yuseol. Even though it was a small gesture compared to what he had done for her, she felt that if she continued to repay his kindness in small ways, eventually...

Eventually?

Suddenly, Angel felt her thoughts racing and quickly stopped herself. She felt a bit unsettled.

---

The first day of the new term at Stella is leisurely. Unlike other magic schools that start with a grueling schedule from the first day, Stella allows for a relaxed start. Most students attended brief orientations for their classes and quickly returned, making the S-Class unusually crowded today. Although Flame occasionally got bored and ran around shouting, "Looking for soccer players! Just come and play!" in the neighboring classes, it was a minor detail.

Having a reason to stick close to Baek Yuseol after giving him her homework, Angel followed him around except during separate class times. However, she seemed to regret even those separate class times and eventually asked him.

"...Can you tell me your class schedule?"

Baek Yuseol, sitting across from her, looked bewildered as Angel nodded nonchalantly.

"Why? Are you planning to follow me?"

"Yes."

"What? Are you interested in me?"

He asked jokingly, as he had in the first semester, but Angel replied indifferently again.

"Maybe?"

"Huh?"

"Is that a problem?"

"No, it's not, but... don't you have other things to do?"

She pondered for a moment, then smiled brightly.

"I have a bit more free time now, thanks to someone."

"Well... whoever that is, it's a bit troublesome..."

Baek Yuseol was genuinely troubled. In about three years, Angel would undoubtedly grow into an outstanding magician and one of the top beauties in the world, but for now, she was still a high school student. He couldn't see her as anything other than a child, and if she really approached him with romantic intentions, it would be quite problematic.

"Am I jumping to conclusions?"

He reconsidered. She had asked if she was interested, not if she liked him. Angel might have answered that way because she was clueless about romance and took it in a different context.

"Yeah, that must be it."

In the original game, Angel only started falling for the male leads in her second year. Until then, the male leads were the ones obsessing over her, so it was too early for that now. Moreover, there hadn't been any events where the male leads teased or flirted with her, so it was safe to assume it wouldn't happen.

"Phew, I was worried for nothing."

"Huh?"

"Nothing."

Since she had helped him with his urgent homework, he thought it would be nice to treat her to a meal, as a typical Korean would.

"We don't have much to do today. How about dinner?"

"Huh? Isn't it a bit early for club activities?"

"Separate from that, I just want to eat. We don't always have to eat as part of club activities. I'll buy you whatever you want."

Angel looked at him blankly for a moment, then quickly nodded.

"Okay."

"Then it's pork soup for dinner."

"...Didn't you say you'd buy me what I wanted?"

"You'll like it."

"I've never heard of such food before..."

"Trust me."

Although she pouted, Angel suddenly had a thought.

"...What if I really like this strange dish called pork soup?"

It felt a bit odd. Baek Yuseol was so sure she would like an unknown dish. How did he know her secrets?

"I've been watching you."

Suddenly, she remembered a day in spring. With Stella bathed in the sunset, Baek Yuseol had said those words to her. She hadn't understood then, but now she felt she could grasp the meaning.

"A regressor, a time traveler."

Baek Yuseol was a man who freely traveled through time, deeply influencing his past. His words, "I've been watching you," couldn't be ordinary. He must have encountered many versions of her in various timelines, possibly knowing her better than she knew herself.

"...Alright. Let's go eat that strange pork soup."

So, she decided not to doubt Baek Yuseol's words anymore. Even if the dish seemed bizarre, she trusted she would like it because he said so.

"A wise choice."

Seeing Angel accept so readily, Baek Yuseol felt pleased and led her to Arcanium. And when she took her first bite of pork soup, Angel regretted it.

"It's not good..."

"Huh? Everyone in my hometown praised it."

"Maybe just the people in your town..."

She realized too late that Baek Yuseol's confidence came from his own love for the dish. 

"Why doesn't it taste good? Try adding some pepper and take a proper bite."

"No, I'll eat it my way."

Angel got up, went to the kitchen, and brought back various seasonings. She adjusted the soup to her taste, making it clearer and more palatable. As she carefully ate the now tolerable soup, she looked at Baek Yuseol sitting across from her. Despite his lack of elegance and grace while eating, she couldn't help but keep watching him. She didn't know why.
