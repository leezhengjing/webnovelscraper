# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 225

## 47. The End of Summer (5)

In the moment when the scythe of a sinister hue flew towards my neck, only one thought occupied my mind.

‘I’m really going to die.’

Calculations? Strategy? Compromise? None of it mattered. The only thing I could do right now was to blink forward.

Swish!

As the seats and windows around where I had been standing were all sliced apart, I managed to reach right in front of him. However, even though I had closed the distance, without my wand, there was nothing I could do. Even if I had a weapon, it was doubtful whether I could inflict any damage on him.

So, I did nothing.

He seemed slightly surprised by my sudden teleportation, his eyes flashing as he leapt back. Then, in a chilling voice, he asked,

“Blinking… You use an unusual magic. Why didn’t you attack?”

There was no need to explain that swinging this cheap staff, which was less valuable than a back scratcher, would be meaningless. However, there was no need to remain silent either. Rather… if he was misunderstanding something, I should use it to my advantage.

“Kal Harimus.”

I wasn’t sure if I remembered correctly, but his eyes widened significantly, indicating I had.

‘Witch Hunter.’

They are beings who live hidden in the shadows of the world, known for hunting witches, who are now believed to be extinct. However… they pay a heavy price to become witch hunters, giving up all their identity—race, gender, age, name, and even their face. This is necessary to deal with witches, whose abilities often involve bewitching or ensnaring their opponents like a drug.

“Why do you know that name?”

“Why do you think? You figure it out.”

“...Could it be? Are you also a witch hunter?”

“Yes. I can’t show you my mark due to circumstances, but showing you the witch’s crystal should be proof enough, right?”

These beings live alone in the shadows of the world, so their social skills are extremely poor. I needed to coax him as gently as possible. He seemed to scrutinize me closely, narrowing his eyes slightly.

“But… you haven’t discarded your face.”

“I made this one temporarily. The witch I tracked this time was hiding in society.”

“That’s unusual… but don’t you have any pride as a witch hunter?”

“I have a witch I must kill, even if it means giving up my pride. I can never forgive them.”

Moved by my intense emotional appeal, the witch hunter hesitated for a moment before lowering his staff.

“I see. That’s why the power of ‘Yeonhongchun Samwol’ is so great. Even if it’s not genuine, when you put on a ‘performance,’ your face shows sincerity. This perfect act can deceive anyone.”

“Now, hand over the crystal. It’s my trophy.”

“Sorry. Here it is.”

The witch hunter handed me the crystal orb. I accepted it and pondered for a moment. Witches rarely appear in the main episodes, but there are related characters. For instance, Stella’s head knight, Arain, is cursed by a witch and living on borrowed time, and Hyeijin Macaron of the Myeolamdan is a descendant with some witch blood.

Witches have left significant scars in the Aether World story, and even though they rarely appear, their abilities are immense. The ‘498 Witch’s Crystal Orb’ I have is… honestly, an incomplete half. When I played Aether World Online, I wasn’t deeply interested in witches, so I didn’t complete the item.

But what if I could complete this item? It might become a growth item even better than the Lost Dawn’s Wheel.

“I’ll be going now.”

As the witch hunter turned into mist and began to disappear, I hurriedly called out to him.

“Wait.”

“What is it?”

“I actually need your help for this witch hunt. It’s not difficult, can you help me?”

“Speak. If it’s for a witch hunt, I’ll help as much as I can.”

“I planned to lure the witch using this crystal orb, but its power is very weak. I need to replenish its magic. Can you take me to your subspace?”

“Why?”

“My subspace was completely destroyed in the last battle.”

“Did a witch do it?”

“Yes, it was a witch who used pain magic. It was a terrible battle, but I succeeded in beheading them.”

“I see.”

The witch hunter hesitated for a moment before nodding.

“Follow me.”

He swung his staff wide, and a dark red warp hole appeared as the air split in half.

‘Oh… honestly, it’s a bit amazing. Even space-type mages need to be at least 7th class to use such techniques freely, but these guys use them so effortlessly.’

As the witch hunter stepped through the space, I followed him. The space that unfolded was entirely dark. The interior resembled an ordinary alchemist’s laboratory, but with a slight difference—it felt like a mad scientist’s lab for biological experiments. Fragments of creatures, presumed to be monsters or humans, were scattered everywhere, intertwined or synthesized into even more grotesque forms.

Efforts to discard the flesh. I tried my best not to look at it. Even with the blessing of Yeonhongchun Samwol, enduring such a disgusting sight was difficult.

“This is the essence of a witch.”

“...You’ve collected quite a bit.”

The witch hunter handed me a beaker filled with dark red liquid, and I complimented him out of courtesy. However, analyzing the amount with my glasses… honestly, it wasn’t that much. It was enough for my use, but it was clear that the witch hunter hadn’t been doing this for long. That’s probably why he fell for my obvious lie so easily.

‘Wait, should I take more?’

Originally, I planned to take just a little, but I changed my mind.

“Thanks, I’ll use it well.”

I carefully opened the dark red beaker, placed my witch’s crystal orb on the table, and slowly poured the liquid.

Sizzle…!

A message soon appeared.

[The grade of the item ‘498 Witch’s Crystal Orb’ has increased.]

[499 Witch’s Crystal Orb]

Witches have no names. If they had to be named, their years of life would be their name. Tired of a life of killing and being killed, their age was their power, their meaning. This crystal, made by a witch who lived for an incredible 498 years, had aged another year with the help of the witch hunter… but honestly, it’s a shame. If it aged one more year, it would become a 500-year-old crystal orb, but I have no way to increase its grade alone.

Gurgle! Sizzle…!

So, I poured the beaker’s magic power generously into my crystal.

“Hey.”

“Are you using too much?”

The witch’s magic is the food and source of power for witch hunters. It seemed he felt a bit regretful seeing me use so much.

“Just a little more.”

“No matter what, this is too much…”

“Sorry. I’ll repay you later.”

“This is too much. Even as a fellow witch hunter, I can’t tolerate excessive greed.”

Geez, he’s really whining. I had no choice but to point out that he was a rookie witch hunter.

“Hey.”

“Speak.”

“How many witches have you caught so far? Ten?”

“...Seven.”

“See, that’s why you don’t know. I’ve caught over thirty witches.”

“Impressive. So what?”

“It means you’re a rookie. To lure the witch I’m hunting, I need a 500-year-old crystal orb, but you don’t even know why, do you?”

He fell silent for a moment, then shook his head.

“I don’t know.”

“I thought so.”

Of course, he wouldn’t know. I don’t know either.

“This hunt is very important. I’m planning to hunt an incredibly powerful and terrifying witch. Do you understand now? By donating your dark magic to me, you’re helping to eliminate one more disgusting witch.”

He seemed somewhat unconvinced, but since I claimed to have hunted thirty witches, he reluctantly agreed, albeit with a sense of reluctance.

Ding!

While we were talking, the item was completed. Feeling a bit guilty about taking more, I placed the beaker back on the table, patted his shoulder, and walked past him.

“If this hunt succeeds, half the credit goes to you. Anyway, thanks. I’ll use it well.”

“...Alright.”

As I quickly exited the witch hunter’s subspace, I found myself back inside the train.

“Phew…”

He didn’t follow, did he? I was worried he might hold a grudge and follow me, but it seemed that wasn’t the case. As soon as I exited, the subspace disappeared as if it had been waiting.

“Geez. People should learn to share a bit.”

I plopped down in my original seat, and the darkened atmosphere quickly reversed.

Clatter, clatter!

The train resumed its normal operation, and the passengers who had disappeared without notice returned to their original positions. Thinking that this was the ability of a ‘rookie’ witch hunter made me break out in a cold sweat.

Well, anyway. It’s all good.

“Let’s check the item.”

*Description: A special crystal orb created by a witch who lived for 498 years to train her body. When used, it transports you to the witch’s space.

▼List
1. Swim away from the shark!
2. Run on the dizzying tightrope.
3. With the wolf…

Hmm, it’s just right. It’s a unique item that significantly increases your stats each time you clear one of the so-called ‘mini-games.’ Since it boosts physical stats, it wasn’t very popular in the game. I don’t know why this witch trained her body, but the most plausible rumor was that she died while playing the mini-games in the crystal orb. So, I should be careful when using it.

It’s dangerous. Definitely.

But since it guarantees significant growth… it’s only human to feel a bit excited about having it.

‘Should I try it a bit until we arrive?’

My original plan was to secretly try it out one by one after arriving at the dormitory, but now that I have the 500-year-old witch’s orb, I can’t hold back any longer.
