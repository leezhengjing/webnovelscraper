The magic school in front of the blink, became a genius 278 52. Field training (7)

The Wind Empire had a long and rich history, with many legends and tales passed down from village to village, so there was no time to be bored while traveling. 

"Well, they say a gumiho lived here until 200 years ago."
"Really…."
Anella tried to ignore the old man at the next table in the restaurant, his spittle flying as he spoke.
"This little kid from a different place doesn't believe a word I say. Ha ha."
"It's true! When I was a kid, I fought a wolf with two heads, and no one believed me for 28 years!"
"Bull! That's just a lie!"

While the old men bickered, Anella quickly stood up and left the restaurant. The flowing cold sweat melted away in the fresh air of the Wind Empire.

"Whew, nice… Definitely a place where the clean air makes you feel good. Even though those old men have a little too much ego, they're not bad people. They just want to share their local legends and customs with outsiders. Good people and good culture. It’s a happy country. …My country is destroyed."
"Ugh! Good thought!"

She tiptoed as much as possible, walking in the shade and checking her surroundings. She was trying to stay out of sight, but it didn't seem to work very well. It was already scorching hot, and hiding in the shadows wasn't going to make a person invisible. In fact, the sight of a young foreign girl walking stealthily like a cat was quite noticeable. 

"Huh? Student. Are you lost? Is this your first time in this country?"
"No, no! I have a map."

With her twin braids and the Severun Kingdom magic school uniform, she looked barely older than a middle school student. Maybe it was because she was a young girl traveling alone, but the people of the Wind Empire, with their good hearts, kept taking an interest in her. It wasn’t a good kind of interest, given her position as a Black Mage infiltrating the Wind Empire. Recently, she had heard that Eltman Eltwin was close to developing a new technique to detect the mana waves of Black Magic. She couldn't rely on this disguise forever. 

‘Besides, I’ve already been caught a couple of times.’

Her perfect ability to seal her Black Magic with Black Magic Suppression Technique, making it completely undetectable by ordinary mages, had been detected by ordinary Stella students.

Fuleim and Bai Yusuel. Two very special kids. Although they were friendly towards her, and she survived because of them, it could be said that she was nearly in danger. 

‘Anyway, what am I supposed to do here?’

This mission was absurdly straightforward: head to the capital of the Wind Empire, Taiyushan, and find the traces left by the Witch King. That was all well and good, but without any clues, how was she supposed to operate? 

Ideally, she wouldn't have to meet them, but if she spent a week with no progress, she’d be truly dead. She had to do something, anything. 

‘…Anything? How?’

She was clueless. With no other options, Anella visited famous tourist spots. It wasn't that she wanted to relax and enjoy sightseeing when her heart could burst at any moment. She just couldn't handle the frustration any longer, so she did it. 

Wind Empire, Taiyushan, Hailong Temple. It was said that the ‘Sea Dragon’ with eight legs and three tails ascended in the Heavenly River of Taiyushan. A temple was built to honor the existence of this mysterious divine beast. Hailong everywhere you look. Even a Hailong statue built to a height of 30 stories wasn’t enough. The surrounding area was full of Hailong-related tourist goods, which Anella nonchalantly scanned with indifferent eyes. 

‘What’s the point of buying that stuff…?’

The prices were unbelievable, starting at 30,000 credits for one item. That could buy at least three meals! Anella, with her poor finances, could not afford such extravagance. 

"Hey, student. Are you sightseeing? Why don't you buy a charm?" An old man beside her waved a charm. 
"A charm?"

"Yes. It's only 5,000 credits. You're buying luck for 5,000 credits."
"Come on… Who believes that stuff?"

Anella was an adult. A 40-year-old adult. Even if she looked like a child, she wasn't falling for tricks like that. 

"Ha ha… You don't know. Okay, little lady, what you said is right. It’s possible that this charm has no effect. But believing is important. You can be happy by having this charm, and it will help you to believe you can do it."
“…What's so good about believing?"
"There's nothing you can achieve in the world without believing. This charm helps you to store that belief and use it whenever you need it. It makes you believe."
"So… you’re saying this charm is an object that makes you believe you can do it, by storing the ‘belief that you can do it’? It sounds strange, but it makes sense."

Under normal circumstances, she might have dismissed it as nonsense. But right now, Anella was in a situation no different from a raft drifting on the vast ocean. She needed to believe in something. 

"I’ll… I’ll buy it."
"There’s also a thing that adds belief to belief. Want to see?"

In a flash, she spent 68,000 credits. Holding a handful of charms and fake relics, Anella sighed belatedly. 

"So stupid… If this stuff could really solve everything, why would people even bother to try? Still, I bought it, so I can’t throw it away."

She tried to put the charms in her bag, but a particular item caught her eye. An old charm that Bai Yusuel had given her to keep. 

“…This is also a charm." 

Charms were very unfamiliar in the world of mages. Charms were closer to sorcery and necromancy than magic.  Sorcery had been abandoned a long time ago because it was less efficient than magic, but there were still people who carried on the tradition. Magic, which was based on calculation, was different from sorcery, which was said to manifest through faith and belief. Just hearing about it was strange. 

“What’s the use of this…?”

Her eyes fell on the charm merchant, the old man. Since she had already bought so many charms, wouldn’t he answer a simple question? 

"Excuse me, old man."
"Yeah? Want to buy more? No refunds."
"No, it's not that. I have an old charm. Is it also… you know, a charm of faith?"
“Charm…? Let me see.” 

Anella showed him Bai Yusuel’s old, torn soul charm. The old man’s eyes widened.

“Hm? This is…”
“Do you know what it is?”

The old man squinted, looked at it for a while, and then took out a magnifying glass from a drawer, held the charm, and stared intently. 

“This is… An ancient Fengspell artifact from more than 300 years ago.”
“Fengspell?”
“Yeah. It’s similar to the rune language that your mages use as a basis for their magic, but it’s a unique spell language of the Wind Empire. I heard that the tradition died out a long time ago… Very curious. Besides, it seems like quite a powerful spell is cast on it… Little girl, where did you get this?”
"I… found it."
"Anyway, that charm is very valuable, so keep it safe. You never know what kind of mysterious power it holds."

Anella took the charm back and stared at it with newfound curiosity. A single old, torn charm. It was just one charm, not enough to make her believe in anything. She was starting to doubt if Bai Yusuel’s words were true, and if she could become human by believing. 

‘…He was telling the truth.’

He wasn't lying.

"Then… maybe you can’t translate it, but do you know how to use it?”
“Hm, this is something you have to go find a traditional sorcerer to translate. I have no idea.”
“I see.”

It was a shame, but there was nothing she could do. The lineage of sorcerers had died out, and it seemed unlikely that an old man selling charms on the street would be able to decipher such a genuine charm. 

‘Wait a minute.’

If that was the case, wouldn’t that mean that all the charms this old man was selling were fake? She was about to say something, when the old man spoke first.

“Oh, right. I heard that a young sorcerer recently joined. I heard she's a true successor of sorcery, so why don’t you try finding her.”
“A young sorcerer…?”
“Yeah. I heard she’s about your age, and she’s quite talented. I heard that she’s seen occasionally on the Castle Road… ”
“What’s her name?”
“Nobody knows. She wears a mask, so few people have seen her face. Actually, that makes her easy to find. Not many young sorcerers wear masks.”
“Hm. Thanks… ”

Anella bowed to the old man and walked down the street, staring blankly at the charm. Finding the Witch King was important, but she wanted to uncover the secrets of this charm as soon as possible.

‘A young sorceress… Can I find her immediately? I hope so.’

Holding the charm tightly in her hand, she walked down the Taiyushan road, and heard a crowd of people chattering nearby. 

“What’s going on?”

She focused her Black Magic on her eyes to see clearly. Mages in black suits were forming a formation and blocking the people.  A large, luxurious carriage could be seen in the middle. A clear green mark, the seal of the Bingu Cloud Corporation, was engraved on it. It was a genuine emblem, which only the Bingu Cloud CEO and his daughter were allowed to use. Anella's eyes widened. 

‘Is the Bingu Cloud CEO coming here in person? …’

The Bingu Cloud Corporation was the true power of the Southern Plains.  They were basically the ones who fed the Wind Empire. 

“This is scary.”
“Right? Just because one merchant showed up, the Seven Wind Clans came to greet them in person… ”
“If you disrespect the Bingu Cloud Corporation, you’ll get a hard time at the upcoming succession ceremony.  They're probably groveling.”
“Even if it’s not the CEO himself, but his daughter who’s here… ”
“The CEO or his daughter, they both hate noise and rarely come to Taiyushan, except for important things.”
“There must be something important.  I’m sure of it.”
“Really?  They own 30% of the Taiyushan real estate and they never even come here. They're rich.”
“They deserve it. They’re the Bingu Cloud Corporation.”

Apparently, it was Jelliel, the daughter of the Bingu Cloud Corporation, who had visited Taiyushan in person. A mere girl in her twenties, yet her visit was enough to cause a stir in the whole country. It was a clear indication of their immense power. 

‘Amazing….’

A sense of awe washed over her, because she realized they lived in a completely different world from her. She could faintly see Jelliel's profile from afar. She had a cold expression, even colder than hers. 

‘Oh well, what’s the point of worrying about that.’

She’d never interact with them ever again. Anella shook her head, turned around, and ran towards the castle.
