##  Magic School's Front-Line Prodigy - Chapter 294 

**54. League of Spirits (7)**

Time flew by, and the Stella Academy's League of Spirits selection tournament began. It wasn't like the usual tournaments where one match received all the attention. Instead, three or four teams played simultaneously to save time. 

Instead of a tournament, they used a point system. The team with the most points qualified for the national tournament based on their ranking. Each year, only two or three teams got this chance, leading to fierce competition within the academy. 

With 32 participating teams, most of which had grown up receiving scientific training, every match was captivating and impossible to ignore.

“Damn it, I lost to those guys who haven’t even properly played Rios….”

“No way….”

Watching students with dejected expressions trudge out of the arena, Fuleim felt a pang of guilt. He had assembled a team with four overpowered characters that could easily crush even the most skilled team. It was only natural they would effortlessly defeat a team of amateur trainees.

“Are you still doing that?”

“Yeah, that's why I told you not to destroy the enemy tower. I was trying to do something.”

“C'mon! You don't have time for that. We need to finish it when we can. We're not pros. We're noobs compared to them.”

Meanwhile, Bai Yuesue, was diligently combining something. Maybe he was still researching a new item tree from the previous game. It was fascinating to see him continue doing this even after advancing to the preliminaries.

Fortunately, it meant that he was having fun.

“Bai Yuesue as usual?”

“I don't know. What was he up to?”

“I don't think I've ever seen him study….”

“Right. He always trains. If you want to find him, just go to the fitness room or the training ground.”

“Where does he go when he's not there?”

“He's been going out, I heard.”

“Where does he go?”

“Maybe he's just going out to enjoy his hobbies?”

Enjoying his hobbies. No way. His outings were all for the benefit of the world. He rarely went out for personal reasons.

Right, Bai Yuesue didn't have hobbies. He didn't have a personal life. He always went out after school. Or if he didn't have to go out, he stayed at the training ground all day. It was a normal life for an elite magic warrior, but it was still too much. 

Even the S-Class prodigies didn't just study all day. Even A-Jel had hobbies like gourmet food and board games. Recently, Hong Biyan had taken an interest in Soul Chess and tea and was trying to learn about them.

Other students also had hobbies. It was impossible to live a life studying all day. Yet, Bai Yuesue was the only one who didn't seem to have any such personal life.

He drove himself to the limit, not wasting a single minute or second, constantly moving. As if someone was whipping him from behind.

That was why seeing Bai Yuesue genuinely enjoying the competition brought Fuleim comfort.

“Well, it seems like we managed alright.”

“What?”

After the match, Bai Yuesue spent a long time looking through his item inventory. After waiting about 30 minutes, he finally stretched and got up.

“Something I can use in the match. I originally had this idea, but I stopped working on it when I started playing Rios.”

There were two kinds of 'pros' in the game. One was the 'researcher' who analyzed skills and items mathematically to find the optimal outcome. The other was the 'master' who gained experience through countless games.

While there were rare cases where someone possessed both, typically, the researcher's findings were adopted by the master.

Unfortunately, ‘Character Bai Yuesue’ was not researched by anyone, so Bai Yuesue, a pure master, had to experiment directly. Fortunately, he still had the byproducts of research from his rookie days when he wanted to get good at Rios. He managed to combine them, however rough it was, into something usable.

But Fuleim, who had no idea about that, was dumbfounded.

“……Already?”

It was impossible to create an item combination in less than two weeks. Bai Yuesue was completely unfamiliar with Rios.

“Yeah. It took a while, but I can use it in the next selection.”

Bai Yuesue seemed indifferent, as if it was nothing to him, despite Fuleim's surprise.

“Well, that's good then.”

It was a waste of energy to be surprised by such trivial things. It was just Bai Yuesue.

**[Match in Progress: Maolun White Team]**

As he left the arena, Bai Yuesue checked the team match and realized that the team Leydin had mentioned was currently playing.

‘Hmm, how can I help those guys...’

The thought was short-lived, and the conclusion was simple.

‘Should I throw the game?’

It was hardly a sportsmanlike mentality. 

***

The elf city, Skyflower Cradle, nestled on the ancient world tree, Chunling Tree, which stretched its roots into the Primeval Mountain Range and towered over the clouds. The city was formed by intertwining branches, creating roads and buildings. 

Wheeled vehicles were simply inconvenient to use in this place. The dwarves lived in flat areas and used wheels extensively, so whenever they visited Chunling Tree's cradle, their grumbling was loud.

“What an inconvenient place.”

Duamri, the translator and diplomat for the dwarf king, ‘Jin Gangpaljung,’ was deeply unhappy that they couldn't use their proud invention, the aerial train. 

Although the dwarves and elves generally didn't get along, Duamri wouldn't have come here if the king hadn't ordered him.

“Oh, hello?”

Maydi, the elf king's advisor. She had taken over the former advisor Orenha’s position, receiving favor from the queen and possessing exceptional abilities. But she was still young, and her timid nature made greeting strangers awkward.

“Tsk, what a clueless one.”

“H-hic!”

Duamri shook his head, his head large for his short stature. Maydi was startled. The knights guarding her on either side hardened their expressions, but Duamri didn't care about that.

“Hey, look up.”

“Yes, yes?”

Thud!

“Kyaa?!”

“Straighten your back! Look up! Stare with those eyes fiercely! See? Do it like that! You clumsy elf kid!”

Duamri slammed his forearms against Maydi’s waist and shoulders, forcing her to straighten, and then used both hands to make her eyes wide.

“Huh? The king's advisor should have at least this much presence. I mean, the former advisor, Orenha, was at least easy to talk to….”

“Please stop talking about the former advisor Orenha. He's a criminal.”

“I know. I'm furious that I could even communicate with that garbage.”

Duamri slumped onto the sofa, then put the tea in front of him to his lips and spat it out. Then he said:

“No dark beer?”

“….We don’t drink during meetings.”

“What a buzzkill.”

“Please state your reason for coming.”

“Ah, right.”

Duamri snapped his fingers, and a dwarf waiting behind him approached and placed a black bag on the table. He turned the combination lock and opened the bag, spinning it around to show it to Maydi.

“This…is mud?”

The bag was filled with mud, and Maydi sensed a living mana within it.

“Yes. Mud. Specifically, mud from the twelfth moon of the twelve divine moons, ‘Damgaltoi’s moon.’”

The twelve divine moons. Maydi's eyes widened at the sudden mention of the term.

“Want a taste? Kid?”

“N-no.”

“Just kidding. Show this to the elf king quickly.”

“Is there…a reason?”

“Yes. ‘The Land of the Dead Giant,’ where Damgaltoi’s moon sleeps, seems to be enraged recently. You know, that place is sealed by the elf king and the dwarf king.”

“But the seal hasn't weakened, so why is Damgaltoi’s moon’s emotions resurfacing?”

“It's a bad sign….”

“Right. He’s one of the twelve divine moons who hates all life on earth.”

Damgaltoi’s moon was the most violent of the twelve divine moons, known for his terrible temper. Countless nations and cities were wiped out overnight by him in the ancient past.

“That’s why…Click!”

As Duamri was about to say something, the door opened, and the queen, Kotsurin, appeared. Maydi hurriedly got up and bowed, and Duamri reluctantly stood up and bowed as well.

“Your Majesty. It's an honor to meet you.”

Kotsurin, the elf queen, came out of nowhere. Duamri was completely surprised. Although he had come as a diplomat, he didn’t expect the queen herself to show up.

“I've heard a lot about you, Duamri.”

“It's an honor.”

“I received a message from the dwarf king. He said you would bring important news.”

“Yes, that's right.”

Duamri’s expression hardened, but Kotsurin shook her head.

“You don't need to be afraid. The dwarf king has apologized profusely for not being able to come himself.”

“I understand.”

Kotsurin moved Maydi aside and sat comfortably on the sofa. She was currently wearing only a veil over her face, without the white mask. Her silhouette faintly glowed, making her look even more mysterious.

“Are…you not wearing a mask anymore?”

“Are you curious?”

“I’m afraid I asked an impolite question.”

“No, it’s fine.”

Kotsurin stroked the veil and smiled softly.

“I don’t need to wear a mask anymore. But…the curse is still in effect, and it charms everyone who looks at me, so I’m still wearing a veil.”

“Isn’t it good to gain the favor of others? Especially for elves, I think it would be better.”

“No.”

She was resolute.

“I…only want to show my face to those whose hearts I want to win. I don’t want to forcibly steal the hearts of others.”

‘Hmm.’

Someone whose heart she wanted to win. No matter how much Duamri pondered, he couldn’t think of anyone like that for the elf queen.

‘Does she plan to wear a veil for the rest of her life?’

He didn’t care about that part, so Duamri continued the earlier conversation.

“Do you recognize this mud?”

“…Yes. It’s one of the fragments of Damgaltoi’s moon’s emotions.”

“That's right. So, I have a question for you…. You recently fought ‘Absolute Invincible Cheolibeon.’ Did you notice anything strange about him?”

Strange?

“He’s always been strange.”

More precisely, his abilities were strange. The earth seemed to protect him, making it impossible to attack, and he attacked violently, wanting to eradicate all life around him. It was a hassle.

“He is loved by the twelve divine moons…. It’s still a mystery. Why does Damgaltoi’s moon, who hates all life on earth, love the black mage?  Seeing him attach his soul to the black mage and forbidding the approach of any other living being, I could see how deeply he loved him…. but why?”

“Your Majesty.”

Duamri whispered softly.

“Actually, I didn’t come to ask you questions on behalf of the king. It's a kind of….”

Warning, advice, suggestion. Many words raced through his mind, but none seemed suitable to speak to the elf queen. He could only lengthen the sentence to form words.

“…I came here to inform you about a crisis, for your safety.”

“That means…?”

“Damgaltoi’s moon is enraged because Cheolibeon is injured. He thinks it's your fault or the fault of the magic academy headmaster, Aryumun.”

Or…

He hesitated.

“Maybe he hates the boy, Bai Yuesue, who dealt the final blow to Cheolibeon.”

Startled. Kotsurin’s fingertips trembled as Bai Yuesue’s name was mentioned. Duamri noticed but looked away to avoid affecting her emotional control.

‘Damgaltoi’s moon’s rage….’

It was something he had never considered. Cheolibeon was a being who travelled and hid himself around the world, and there was no one who could harm him except the black magic king. Thus, there had been no reason for Damgaltoi’s moon to be enraged until now.

“…Your Majesty. Our dwarf king is searching for a way to quell Damgaltoi’s moon’s rage, but the situation is difficult.”

“I know. Soon, ‘Jingangchilwol’s….”

Kotsurin stopped talking, realizing that the knights and Maydi were present.

“….Anyway, about this matter, it would be best to discuss it with Headmaster Aryumun separately.”

After saying that, Duamri bowed deeply and left. Kotsurin bit her lip, a troubled expression on her face.

‘Damgaltoi’s moon’s rage, and…the witch queen. Recently, Kotsurin had been hearing information from various sources that she had begun to move.  In particular, the news that the witch queen was targeting Bai Yuesue chilled her to the bone.

‘Why are things always happening to him…?

Her face hardened. As she stared blankly at her reflection in the teacup, Maydi approached cautiously and asked.

“Your Majesty…are you alright?”

“Yes, yes. I’m fine.”

Kotsurin forced a smile, pretending to be strong. As a queen, she couldn't show her emotions to her subjects.

“You didn’t hear about this incident. I’ll take care of everything, so don’t mention it to anyone until the meeting.”

“As you command.”

Everyone would know about Damgaltoi’s moon’s rage soon.  When the ‘Tai Dong’ begins in the Land of the Dead Giant, there will be disasters like large-scale earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The previous elf king and the current dwarf king combined their power to pacify him, but it’s been over a hundred years since then. 

They hoped he wouldn't awaken again because he had been quiet all this time, but….

Kotsurin closed her eyes tightly. Amidst beings powerful enough to shake the world’s peace, Bai Yuesue was only small and vulnerable. She prayed that he wouldn’t be swept away.

‘May the World Tree's protection be with him.’
