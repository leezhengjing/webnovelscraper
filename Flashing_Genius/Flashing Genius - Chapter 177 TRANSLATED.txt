# I Became a Genius at the Magic School

## Chapter 177: Unreal (1)

In the waves of thoughts where even light and time lose their direction, Flame was walking endlessly forward. Like pressing the power button on a TV, Flame's consciousness, which had been completely blacked out, returned.

"Ah."

She stopped in her tracks and hurriedly looked around. The noisy and foul-smelling surroundings. The gray buildings towering high into the sky, the cars spewing exhaust, the people and students heading towards their daily lives.

"Uh..."

Thud!

"Move! I'm in a hurry."

A company employee bumped into Flame's shoulder as she stood there blankly. Only then did she realize she was carrying a bag.

"This is... [Ilwol High School, Class 3-7, Flame]."

It was a name tag.

"Ah, right."

Only then did she remember. She was Flame, a third-year student at Ilwol High School in Seoul. Wasn't she on her way to school right now?

'Geez.'

She must have spaced out for a moment. She had almost stayed up all night studying, so her head was a bit fuzzy. To dream such a fantastical dream.

'...But, what kind of dream was it?'

They say the more you try to remember a dream after waking up, the more it fades away. Now, she couldn't remember any of it.

"Whatever."

Shaking off the memories of the dream world, she took out her smartphone. Checking the bus route application, it showed that the bus would arrive in 5 minutes.

'...The controls feel a bit awkward.'

Why did it feel unfamiliar to use her smartphone? Standing at the bus stop, she was tapping her phone when someone suddenly hugged her from the side.

"Hey~ Flame~ Why have you been ignoring my messages all day~?"

"Uh, uh?"

It was a very surprising hug for her, but the other person seemed familiar with the situation. The girl with long black hair was Han Choyeon. Despite her elegant and calm appearance, she had a very mischievous personality. She had been Flame's closest friend since their first year.

"Huh? You're on your phone now. What are you watching? YouTube? Gosh, when did you start following the Muscle Boy Band? You always acted like you weren't interested in celebrities."

"I wasn't watching it! I just clicked on it because it popped up in the YouTube algorithm..."

"Yeah, right. Do you think I don't know? I can see you always watching their variety shows."

"No, really! I didn't even subscribe, and I don't watch the live broadcasts! I just click on it out of curiosity when it pops up!"

Words that felt both awkward and familiar spilled out of her mouth.

"Really? I thought you only watched English and math lectures on YouTube. Turns out you're human too."

"No, really..."

She wasn't exactly upset, but she felt wronged. It was true that she secretly watched the Muscle Boy Band videos regularly... but she didn't want to get caught like this. Her face felt hot. Pretending not to be interested and then getting caught made her embarrassment multiply.

"Oh, the bus is here!"

"Changing the subject~"

Fortunately, the bus arrived just in time, and Flame hurriedly got on as if escaping. Of course, even after boarding the bus, Han Choyeon sat right next to her, so the teasing didn't stop.

* * *

'...Is this our school?'

Ilwol High School was a five-story building. It was an ordinary building with the school emblem engraved on the rooftop, a common sight in Seoul.

"Why did you stop? Let's go. We're going to be late."

"Oh, okay."

With Han Choyeon urging her, she had no choice but to walk towards the school, but something kept bothering her.

"Hey, Choyeon."

"Why are you calling me so sweetly? It's giving me goosebumps."

"Was our school always this small?"

"Yeah, it's a bit tiny. The school next door is huge."

"No, I mean, it feels smaller than usual."

"Like your height?"

"You crazy girl, do you want to die..."

"See, you get all worked up when I mention your height. You've been acting weird since this morning, and now you're complaining about the school's size?"

Han Choyeon's reaction was normal. Other students on their way to school were laughing and chatting without any awkwardness, so maybe she was the only one overthinking it.

'Am I being too sensitive these days... The stress of being a third-year student is no joke.'

Just as the old-fashioned school bell rang, Flame barely made it to her first class. It wasn't a regular class but a time to preview the English listening test, so most students were lying down and sleeping. The teacher didn't bother to wake them up. Whether they were third-year students or not, only those who wanted to study did so.

Something felt off. No one else was studying properly. Well, there were a few, but only about four or five out of nearly forty students in the class. Was this normal? Weren't they supposed to be studying like crazy? It felt like that just yesterday... Or was that too 'fantastical'?

Was this the real 'reality'?

Ding-dong~

The bell rang, signaling the start of the first period. Flame was in the science track and had a biology class. Because of her short height, she always sat in the front row to see the blackboard clearly.

"Open to page 39."

The biology teacher started the class with a sleepy voice, without any greetings or jokes. As she was about to take out her book from her bag, she noticed her name tag and widened her eyes.

[Yiweol High School, Class 3-7, Flame]

'Huh?'

Was that the correct name of the school?

"About the origin of life..."

But the teacher started the class right away, so she didn't have time to think deeply. The class proceeded quickly, but as expected, hardly anyone was paying attention. Some were already sprawled out in the back, sleeping soundly. She decided not to care about them anymore. They had their lives, and she had hers.

"Ugh, look at that annoying guy."

"He's pretending to be a model student again."

"What does he think he's going to achieve in this crappy school? I want to smack him in the back of the head."

Thud!

A wad of paper hit her head. Flame frowned and turned around. The delinquent girls in the back were giggling.

"Hey, she's glaring at us."

"Scary."

'These brats...'

She almost lost her temper but held back because it was class time. Biology was her weak subject, so she needed to pay attention.

Ding-dong~

But she didn't promise to hold back after class.

Whack! Crash!

"Ugh! Crazy girl!"

"I told you not to disturb me during class, didn't I?"

"Wait, Flame! If you hit someone with a chair, they'll really die!"

"That's what I'm aiming for."

"She's lost it!"

Flame doesn't hold back. Especially not against those who disturb her studies.

"High school delinquents? Do you guys fight well? Do you?"

"You'll regret this..."

"Try messing with me again, and I'll really kill you."

She was too old to be scared of kids' pranks. She regretted being intimidated by punks when she started working...

...Working? Did she have a job?

She paused. As she was swinging the chair, the delinquents took the opportunity to scatter. Han Choyeon, with a worried expression, took the chair from her hands and asked bluntly.

"Are you on your period?"

"No, you crazy girl."

"You're really sensitive today."

"I don't know. I just want to break everything."

"But what are you going to do? If they call their brothers..."

"Brothers?"

She remembered. The delinquents at her school were protected by a gang they called 'brothers.'

"...Right?"

She realized she was in deep trouble, but there was still plenty of time left in the day to come up with a plan.

Ding-dong~

The school bell rang.

'...What?'

So suddenly?

Flame hurriedly looked at Han Choyeon. She was happily humming and getting ready to leave.

"Wait... Is it already over?"

"Huh? What is?"

"It was just the first period."

"Yeah, I know. I fell asleep during the first period, and now it's time to go home! Do you want to go to the karaoke?"

"...No."

"Hmm, right. You don't like singing. Anyway, be careful on your way home. It doesn't seem likely, but those guys looked really pissed earlier."

Han Choyeon pointed at the delinquents and then disappeared out of the classroom.

"Sigh... I don't know what's going on anymore."

As she was packing her bag to go home, she noticed her name tag again.

[Samwol High School, Class 3-7, Flame]

"Huh...?"

What was going on? Was that the original name of the school?

She hurriedly looked for Han Choyeon, but she was already gone.

'Am I really sensitive these days...'

With her bag slung over her shoulder, Flame trudged towards the school gate.

...She realized her mistake about 5 minutes later.

"Hey. Is this the guy?"

"Yeah. This is the guy."

As expected, the delinquents had brought their 'brothers.' They were so serious about their thug life that they even brought motorcycles to show off their power.

"Haha! You call yourself a model student, but you're a complete idiot? We even had guys at the back gate in case you tried to escape, but you came out the front?"

Flame, with her head down, glanced around. The teachers who made eye contact with the thugs quickly ran away, and the students didn't even look in her direction. She thought about calling the police, but it didn't seem meaningful.

'My school life is ruined.'

Called into an alley, Flame stood with her hands behind her back, her head down. The thugs were squatting and smoking, spitting on the ground.

'I need to study...'

As she sighed, one of the delinquent girls from her class tapped her forehead.

"Hey. Are you sighing? Haven't you come to your senses yet?"

Feeling annoyed, she glared at the delinquent, who flinched and stepped back. Embarrassed by her reaction, the delinquent shouted.

"Do you want to die?"

She could see it. The raised palm. The bulging veins. That arrogant delinquent was about to hit her. But if she stood her ground here, she might really get hurt by the 'brothers,' so she had to endure it. So she decided to just... take the hit and closed her eyes tightly.

...But nothing happened.

'What?'

She opened one eye slightly and saw the delinquent looking at the alley with a confused expression.

"...Who the hell is that?"

"Is that one of the brothers' gang?"

"No. That guy's wearing your school uniform. Do you know him?"

"No. It's my first time seeing him..."

What were they talking about? She turned her head to look at the corner of the alley and saw a boy walking confidently, wearing sunglasses like a third-rate movie protagonist. He looked about seventeen, but judging by his name tag, he was a third-year student like her. The boy's name was...

'Baek Yuseol...?'

It felt familiar. But she couldn't remember who he was.

"Stop. Who are you?"

The thugs blocked Baek Yuseol, who was approaching with his hands in his pockets. He lowered his sunglasses slightly, glanced at the thugs, and smirked. Then he...

Whack! Whack! Thud!

In a single blow, he knocked out three thugs.

'This is like a male lead from a 2000s novel...'

It was a cool scene, but it didn't feel cool at all.

'The situation and direction are too contrived!'

It felt like an old 90s movie with a cheesy BGM playing in the background. But regardless of how tacky it was, Baek Yuseol had come to save her, so she was grateful.

"Hey! Stop that guy!"

"I'll handle him, boss!"

The third-rate thugs shouted third-rate lines and charged at Baek Yuseol, but they were no match for him. Despite his small frame, he displayed terrifying strength, and the thugs were scattered around the alley like modern art.

Finally, Baek Yuseol reached Flame.

"This guy..."

The leader of the thugs hesitated and stepped back, and Baek Yuseol quickly approached him. Then...

...He suddenly lifted a motorcycle onto his shoulder.

"Huh?"

"What?"

"Huh?"

Was it even possible to lift a motorcycle with one hand? Why was he lifting it in the first place? To hit someone with it?

Baek Yuseol's strange actions didn't end there. He lowered his sunglasses slightly, gave a cheesy look, and flashed a bright smile.

"Actually, I wanted this."

Then he quickly ran away with the motorcycle.

"...What the hell is that guy?"

"I don't know, boss..."

The thugs, stunned by the surreal situation, sat down and stared blankly in the direction Baek Yuseol had disappeared.

'This is my chance!'

While they were distracted, Flame quickly grabbed her bag and ran away.

[Yiweol High School, Class 3-7, Flame]

Even in her confused state, she noticed the name tag on her bag. Flame didn't want to think about anything anymore.
