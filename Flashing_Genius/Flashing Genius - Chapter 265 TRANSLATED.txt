# The Genius Who Became a Blink Mage at the Magic Academy - Chapter 265

## 50. Noble Soul (15)

Cheolribeon had anticipated that he would easily subdue Soya. Their abilities were highly compatible, and Cheolribeon had overwhelmingly defeated Soya numerous times in Aether World Online. Additionally, he knew that Cheolribeon would notice Baek Yuseol's presence. No matter how well he hid his presence, it was impossible to completely conceal himself from a 9-Risk Dark Mage.

However...

"Are you the one behind Soya?"

This development was entirely unexpected. With a hardened expression, Baek Yuseol leaped forward and landed in front of Cheolribeon. Despite his improved physical abilities, he couldn't use mana, so his knees could have shattered, but he controlled his blink delicately to make a stylish landing.

Thud!

Upon landing, he saw Soya, half-unconscious, shedding tears and snot like a flood. Normally, her beautiful appearance would make her current state pitiful, but... strangely, he didn't feel that way at all. Instead, he felt exhilarated and refreshed. After all, he had sent her to Cheolribeon with this situation in mind.

'You need to suffer a bit more.'

A trashy Dark Mage who dared to target Yiphanell's heart and even corrupted her noble soul.

"Hmm, up close, you look even more like an ordinary high school student."

"I am a high school student."

"How boring. Did you come all the way here just to play dumb? This friend's expression tells the truth."

Even in her pained state, Soya managed to turn her gaze to Baek Yuseol, looking at him with desperate, pleading eyes, as if he were her last hope... but he had no intention of saving her. Not that he had the ability to.

"Truly... ordinary."

Cheolribeon frowned. Having honed his mind-control ability for hundreds of years, he could indirectly grasp the power dormant within someone, no matter how much they tried to hide it. But strangely, he felt no power from Baek Yuseol. He was just an ordinary person, nothing more, nothing less. Which made him even more suspicious.

'Is it possible for an ordinary person to enroll in Stella Academy?'

Even if he had enrolled with an ordinary body, could he have independently resolved the countless incidents that had occurred so far with that ordinary body?

'Strange...'

Cheolribeon stomped the ground with a hardened expression. As the branch shattered, Soya let out a shrill scream.

"Ugh... Even though I only broke a branch, she must be feeling the pain of a shattered wrist."

He wasn't the type to derive pleasure from causing others pain, but the boy in front of him was too annoying to deal with Soya right now.

"You don't seem willing to talk. I have no choice. This isn't my style, but..."

Cheolribeon clenched and unclenched his fists, drawing out the remaining dark mana to its maximum. Red heat waves shimmered around his body, distorting the flow of air.

"I'll have to force you to talk."

It was certain that Baek Yuseol was the one controlling Soya to fight Cheolribeon. If so, it was safe to assume that he was also the one who ordered her to steal the Spirit's Heart. It was a natural line of thought. However, there was no way to deny it.

'This is troublesome...'

Cheolribeon's suspicion was reasonable, but Baek Yuseol had no way to explain himself. He knew that a clumsy excuse like "I didn't do it" wouldn't work.

'I didn't want to fight...'

One reason was that Cheolribeon was strong enough to survive even against the world's strongest, but also because, despite being a villain, he was a character Baek Yuseol had quite liked when he played the original game. Now that he was a real person, he couldn't express those feelings...

Swoosh!

"Gasp!"

When Cheolribeon stomped the ground with one leg and swung his arm, dark red mana lashed out like a whip. There was no sound. Ignoring the resistance of the air, the mana whip swung at several times the speed of sound. Baek Yuseol felt a chilling sensation and quickly blinked to the side, barely dodging the attack.

'Crazy...!'

He couldn't even see it. He only managed to dodge by instinctively sensing danger at the edge of his sixth sense.

'So this is what a 9-Risk is...!'

Previously, he had described Cheolribeon's attack power as quite low, but that was an extreme example assuming only magical battles. Cheolribeon had risen to the rank of 9-Risk solely with his mind-control ability, but his physical abilities were also incredibly high. Until now, there had been no need to reveal those physical abilities, so no one had paid attention, but now that all his mana was exhausted and he had to move directly, Cheolribeon's true strength was beginning to show.

Boom!

When Cheolribeon lightly kicked off the ground, the ground caved in and collapsed. At the same time, Soya, who felt the pain of the earth being torn apart, screamed and rolled on the ground, but no one paid her any attention.

Slash!

A thick tree that had once been part of the World Tree split in two and collapsed easily, and Baek Yuseol, who had been standing there, disappeared like an afterimage, reappearing about 10 meters away.

'Now!'

Baek Yuseol used blink. He identified the gap in just a few seconds and exploited it instantly.

'The delay between blinks is at most 0.3 seconds.'

To some, it might seem like a fleeting moment, but to a 9-Risk Dark Mage, it was more than enough time.

'Damn it...!'

Baek Yuseol had anticipated that an attack would come during the gap between his blinks. However... he had no way to counter it. To use the next blink, he needed to accurately identify his position, measure the distance, and control the blink, which was impossible to do instantly with ordinary human concentration. So, he had no choice but to blink to a space with the fewest obstacles, barely dodging Cheolribeon's attack, but in the process, his arm was scratched by a branch, causing a wound.

Drip!

Blood dripped. Baek Yuseol jumped back and covered the wound to stop the bleeding. He couldn't use even simple healing magic, so any injury sustained during battle was fatal.

'This is strange.'

Cheolribeon frowned. Despite dodging his attacks several times, Baek Yuseol seemed somewhat clumsy. His combat sense seemed excellent, but his physical abilities didn't seem to match.

'Well... it doesn't matter.'

For whatever reason, if he was in a weakened state, it was actually a good thing. Currently, Cheolribeon couldn't activate any of his abilities or traits, making him vulnerable.

'Now, if I want to cut him down, I can!'

Swoosh!

Dodging the dozens of black mana whips rushing at him, Baek Yuseol's eyes sharpened. Avoiding the fight was impossible. No matter how much he liked Cheolribeon, he had to face him seriously to survive.

'Can I win?'

He didn't know. But it was worth a try.

Thud!

After a series of blinks, Baek Yuseol reached a branch and paused to catch his breath. It was simply to recover the number of blinks he could use, but Cheolribeon also paused to retrieve his whip, creating a brief standoff.

'I need to focus.'

Closing his eyes and focusing on something else during a battle was insane. However, in that fleeting moment, as Cheolribeon retrieved his whip and prepared to swing it again, Baek Yuseol closed his eyes and quickly immersed himself in his mental world.

[The Blessing of Yeonhongchun Samwol is activated.]

How had he fought until now? The number of blinks he could use, three. The maximum distance he could move, 15 meters. These were the clear 'limits' engraved on his soft body. But that wasn't all. His physical abilities were full of flaws. While his blink was fast enough to elude even a 9-Risk Dark Mage, what about the speed at which he swung his sword?

'It's slow.'

To them, it might look like slow motion captured by a high-speed camera. The act of swinging his sword was as slow as a turtle, making it very easy to dodge his attacks, no matter how fast his blink was. It was impossible to swing his sword faster immediately. Despite constant training and never neglecting his practice, there was a limit to his growth speed.

'I need to change my approach.'

He had read all the mental techniques of Ha Taeryeong, the previous holder of the Magic Leakage Body, who had fought against the Archmage. As a swordsman with the Magic Leakage Body, he had shared all the secrets of fighting against mages, but there was no 'method for dealing with Dark Mages' written there. Even Ha Taeryeong hadn't prepared a countermeasure for them, who had superior physical abilities and couldn't be dealt with using simple swordsmanship.

'I have to create it myself.'

He had to think for himself. Until now, he had somehow managed to deal with enemies by luck, but that wouldn't work against Cheolribeon. But perhaps it was fate. Since his absolute ability was completely turned off, if he responded well, he could land a decisive blow.

'Then, rather than cutting, I'll pierce.'

Giving up on the act of cutting and focusing on piercing.

'I'll use the acceleration of the blink to charge straight ahead.'

It was a simple method. It seemed laughable that he hadn't thought of it before. But Baek Yuseol wasn't stupid for not using this method until now. He had tried a piercing attack using blink once before. A long time ago... during the necromancer's attack at the beginning of the semester. He had charged straight at the nearly dead necromancer and delivered a final blow... and almost suffered a fatal injury himself. Why? Because the opponent could easily counterattack when Baek Yuseol charged straight at them. This was why he had always targeted the enemy's side. Because he, with almost zero defense, could be in danger. That one fatal flaw of having no defense had forced him into troublesome fights.

'Focus. If I focus, I can do it.'

Baek Yuseol's mental world deepened. An inhuman level of concentration, surpassing human limits.

[The derived skill 'Hyperfocus' from the Blessing of Yeonhongchun Samwol is activated.]

And so, 0.5 seconds passed.

[Blink]

Slash!

"...Hmm!"

Cheolribeon swung his whip at Baek Yuseol, who had his eyes closed and head raised to the sky, but as Baek Yuseol suddenly disappeared, he frowned.

"Annoying brat. Is running away all you can do?"

As he slowly turned his gaze, he saw Baek Yuseol reappear about 10 meters away, looking at him.

'What is this?'

But something was different. The aura emanating from Baek Yuseol was unusual. It felt as if he was letting even the slightest breeze pass through him. Cheolribeon instinctively knew.

'I don't know exactly, but he's regaining his former strength.'

He couldn't let that happen.

"Hmph!"

Cheolribeon spread his arms and swung his whip, which spread out like dark red hands, wide and large. He was already exhausted from fighting two 9-Class mages simultaneously and dealing with Soya, who was half a witch due to her mind-control ability. He had tried to conserve mana as much as possible, but now that his opponent was serious, he had to show his true power as well. Even if he died here today, he would have no regrets if he gave it his all. He had always thought that way.

'My body is at its limit.'

This attack would be his last.

Drip!

Blood trickled from Cheolribeon's mouth. Forcibly drawing out dark mana from the depths had twisted his insides. The pain was unimaginable for an ordinary person, but Cheolribeon didn't care. He focused all his attention on the boy in front of him, who was pointing a sword at him, and swung the dark hands.

...Whoosh!

The autumn wind rustled the leaves, which slowly fell to the ground. The gentle breeze, as if nothing had happened, brushed past the cheeks of the two men.

"...Ugh!"

Cheolribeon coughed up a mouthful of blood and slowly lowered his head. He looked down at the silver mana sword that had pierced his chest.

'I was careless... My senses have dulled.'

It was partly because he was tired and weakened, but also because the earth had protected him for so long that he no longer needed to sharpen his senses, causing them to dull. But even so, he was still formidable.

"Damn it..."

Baek Yuseol, who had dropped his sword, slowly stepped back and leaned against a tree, sitting down.

'I should have focused a bit more.'

He thought he had perfectly captured all the attacks coming straight at him. But the opponent had also figured that out and had flexibly twisted his attack to target even the smallest gaps.

"This... I might really die..."

The black mana blade that had pierced his waist. It was a fatal wound. He might die soon. In contrast, how was his attack?

Clatter!

As Baek Yuseol's mana infusion disappeared, the Terrifon Sword fell from Cheolribeon's chest and hit the ground. Blood flowed from his chest, but it wasn't a fatal wound. As Baek Yuseol had thrust his sword towards his heart, Cheolribeon had released his mana to twist its trajectory. It was an unbelievable reflex and combat sense, but now was not the time to admire it. He was an enemy he had to fight to the death.

"...It's a pity."

Cheolribeon drew out all his remaining dark mana to heal the wound on his chest. Normally, it would have healed instantly, but now even stopping the bleeding was difficult.

"Consider it an honor. You're the first to wound my chest since that man."

Even though he was weakened, it was still an achievement to almost inflict a fatal wound on a man with the title of Absolute Invincibility. Baek Yuseol, not being a magic warrior, felt no pride in that. He just thought...

'I should have thrust faster.'

He should have used blink a bit faster. He should have focused more to dodge. If he had just a bit more experience... he could have dodged such a ridiculous attack.

'I need to finish this.'

Cheolribeon staggered towards Baek Yuseol, but then he felt a chilling sensation from a distance and hardened his expression. Quickly turning his head, he saw a woman with purple wings approaching rapidly from the sky.

'The Elf King... has she recovered already?'

Seeing the rapidly approaching Ggotseorin, Cheolribeon lowered his head. It would be good to finish off Baek Yuseol now, but he would be too late.

'I need to leave.'

It wasn't to prolong his pitiful life. Cheolribeon picked up the unconscious Soya, who was lying on the ground, crying and sniffling. If he died now, he wouldn't be able to deal with her properly. Carrying Soya, Cheolribeon looked back at Baek Yuseol one last time. He was holding his abdomen with his eyes closed, completely defenseless, but for some reason, Cheolribeon didn't feel like killing him. Because he didn't sense any 'evil' in his eyes. It was strange to think that someone who had controlled Soya and caused chaos with the World Tree had such pure and noble eyes.

'It's okay to let him live for now.'

Finally, Cheolribeon's body merged with the earth and disappeared.
