##  The Genius Who Became a Flash Before the Magic Academy 287:  53. Shadow Cast by the Wind (8)

The Wind Empire, with its vast expanse of land as its advantage, had only recently started to develop a culture of building tall structures. A regulation was put in place, prohibiting the construction of buildings above a certain height within an 18 km radius of the royal palace, making skyscrapers rare. However, the rich always found ways to flaunt their wealth, and one by one, foreign-style high-rise buildings began to appear, culminating in the construction of a "self-proclaimed 7-star hotel." This place had now become a sanctuary for esteemed guests to rest comfortably. Of course, this was a story entirely separate from my own, a mere commoner. However, this time, I had been granted the exceptional opportunity to visit the "Hotel Qingpadan," a 120-story structure known as a haven for nobles, nestled within the Taishan Mountain of the Wind Empire.  

Thanks to the item technology developed in collaboration with Alterisha, I was occasionally treated as a distinguished guest, but I usually preferred to avoid such inconveniences. However, the person sitting opposite me was a different story.

"This place is ridiculously expensive," said  Jelliel, the daughter of the Starcloud Trading Company CEO. When you think of elves, you usually imagine them living in the forest, nibbling on grass, right? But Jelliel seemed like a high elf completely immersed in capitalism. Just looking at her gracefully slicing the steak, it was easy to tell she was accustomed to meat.

"Anyway, it's a stroke of luck.  I ran into you here by chance."  Meeting Jelliel by pure coincidence right after exiting the Persona Gate was truly a blessing. It allowed me to instantly reserve a VIP room at the Starcloud’s Wind Spirit University Hospital. It also meant I could have a reliable person to cover up any potential detection of dark magic from Anella's body. Additionally, she was my only source of support in protecting Anella’s safety until she enrolled in Stella.  Technically, Alterisha was my most dependable ally, but Jelliel was one of the people I could rely on for power. Unlike Hong Biyeon, who still couldn't fully wield her own power, Jelliel had been in a position to effortlessly utilize both money and authority since the beginning.

"So...you...," I said, implying how fortunate I was to have run into her. 

Jelliel briefly displayed a look of bewilderment before a chuckle echoed from beside her. It was Princess Hong Biyeon. Exuding a more aristocratic and refined aura than Jelliel, she calmly muttered as she pierced a salad with her fork, brushing her hair back behind her ear.

"By chance...human relationships are truly wondrous, aren't they?" she said. "A commoner like you? Meeting by chance right at the entrance of the Persona Gate?"

While her tone seemed faintly mocking, wasn't it truly a coincidence? Jelliel wouldn't have deliberately sought me out.

"Isn't that how coincidence works? It's pretty uncanny," I replied nonchalantly, stabbing my steak with my fork. Jelliel let out a subtle sigh of relief, while Hong Biyeon stirred her salad with her fork, clearly irritated.

I couldn't help but feel that the two of them were complete opposites.  One was a woman filled with hidden anger, while the other was ice-cold but utterly insane.  I had a feeling things might explode if they were left together, but since we were sharing a meal, I had to accept the situation.  What’s the harm in some tension? As long as the food is good.

Jelliel, returning to her usual impassive demeanor, finally spoke. 

"I was wondering how you've been."

"Huh? I've been doing fine.  It hasn’t been long since school started, after all."

"...make sure to contact me occasionally," she said casually, almost as a passing thought.

"That’s why I gave you my personal number.  Not just anyone can get this," she said.

While her official number as the CEO’s daughter might be known, her personal number was indeed rare.  It was my only means of private communication with Jelliel.  

Yes, I knew how valuable it was… but constantly bothering her, especially someone like Jelliel, felt wrong.  Out of everyone, she was probably the busiest among my peers.

"Sure… I will sometimes. When I’m bored."

I made my response vague, leaving Jelliel with an ambiguous expression, whether satisfied or not.  She then silently resumed cutting her steak.  

Gazing at her, I turned my head and looked out the window.  One entire wall was made of glass, offering a panoramic view of the Taishan Mountain of the Wind Empire.  It brought back memories of visiting Namsan Tower in Seoul. The similar atmosphere gave me a strange sense of déjà vu. 

Thinking about it, the Aither World was eerily similar to Earth in many ways.  Many countries, including the Wind Empire and the fairies, used three-character Korean-style names, and the overall culture felt like a blend of medieval and modern, infused with a contemporary flair.  

"To be exact, it feels like everything’s been mashed together."  

One country combined modern and medieval elements, while another mixed Chinese and Korean influences.  It was like a mishmash of different eras and countries.

I discreetly glanced at Jelliel. Even her habit of cutting steak was one of the most famous dining customs on Earth.  Even the white lace blouse with the black office skirt felt incredibly modern to me, but her pointed ears shattered my sense of reality.

...No.  After all, I had only been here for less than a year.  Yet, this place felt more real to me.  This familiar feeling.  Why?

The me from Earth led a truly bleak and dry life.  Study, home, games, study, home, games.  As an adult, it became a never-ending cycle of work, commuting, and games.   Yes, "Aither World Online" was always a part of my life's circuit.  

Characters like Bai Yusuel, and countless other figures from Aither.  Although they were virtual beings I couldn’t interact with, even if I skipped the story and spent all day on PvP, I truly immersed myself in the game. I poured half my life into it.  Compared to my lifeless reality, it was only natural that the feeling of living here felt so vibrant.

I dare not call my current life "fun."  I never knew what dangers might lurk around the corner, facing life-threatening incidents and mishaps.  But… my life here had color.  I may have been quite content with that.  

I saw Jelliel in a new light.  The woman I dismissed as a "character I just disliked" during my gameplay, now I was having dinner with her in a high-end restaurant.  This felt both strange and incredibly precious.  

But as I stared at her, Jelliel couldn't lift her head, her gaze fixed on the plate, becoming increasingly restless.

"Commoner."

"Huh?"

"It’s not polite to stare at someone while they're eating."  I realized my mistake thanks to Hong Biyeon’s belated comment.

"...is it a human custom to stare at someone's face while they eat?"

"Ah, sorry."

"It's fine… I say it’s fine, but it’s strange how you can’t even look up and keep cutting your steak.  Were you that uncomfortable?"

Jelliel must be used to such attention. As the CEO’s daughter, she was always in the spotlight, and before that, due to her breathtaking beauty, she couldn’t escape the gaze of every person she encountered. 

Perhaps it was uncomfortable when there were few people. But that wasn’t it.  A typical Jelliel would have stared back with an intensity that could kill.  

Yet, seeing her so embarrassed, just moving her lips, I felt a pang of sympathy. 

"You…"

Jelliel, who had only eaten half her steak, continued fidgeting with her knife.  Finally, after a long pause, she raised her head and looked back and forth between me and Princess Hong Biyeon.

"Do you two often carry out missions together?"

She was directing her question towards Hong Biyeon, but I was about to answer.

"We don't really…," I began, but Hong Biyeon cut me off and answered instead. 

"We do quite often."

I was left speechless, unable to retort.  

"I see," Jelliel nodded and remained silent for a while, then spoke casually.

"When you go on missions, make sure to visit the Southern Plains often. I can provide support."

"Why bother? A commoner can handle things on their own without your help."

"You never know.  Something like what happened today might happen to Bai Yusuel again. Don't you think so?"

"Uh… that's, true, I guess?"  After all, thanks to Jelliel, Anella received treatment and her safety was secured.

"See, I was right?" Jelliel smiled as she spoke.  Hong Biyeon nodded in agreement, her expression emotionless.

Our meal continued to be filled with subtle tension.  I genuinely became curious whether there was a true conflict between the Adollevit family and the Starcloud Trading Company.  The two families exerted tremendous influence globally, so they definitely had friction somewhere.  However, their constant snarling at each other, like they were ready to devour each other, felt strange.

"Jikbakguri.  Is there any truth to this?"

[In the past 50 years, there have been no major conflicts between the Starcloud Trading Company and the Adollevit royal family.]

"Really?"  "...Then why are they behaving like this?"  I felt like a shrimp caught in the fight between a dragon and a tiger.

The two of them continued their quiet feud, a tempest brewing in the silence.  I was barely able to finish my meal amidst the heavy atmosphere.

"Ugh, eating a simple meal is a struggle."

I excused myself to escape the tension by saying I wanted coffee. The aroma of hot, premium coffee filled my nostrils, but I didn’t feel like caffeine. 

"Those two, they won’t actually fight, right?"

As I quietly sipped my coffee, I heard the slow sound of footsteps approaching behind me.  I discreetly turned my head.  The familiar figure stood there.

"Ah, Professor Raydin." 

He was the New Moon professor at Stella Academy and the root of the Black Mage faction.  With his neatly styled hair and spectacles, Professor Raydin’s intellectual image was thick in the air.  He approached me and stood beside me, looking out the window.

"Did you tell her about the transfer?"

"Yes, more or less.  Thanks to you."

Actually, Anella's transfer was facilitated by none other than a Black Mage infiltrating Stella.  Irony, isn’t it?  I was relying on a Black Mage to protect Anella from them. 

If it had been someone else, like Director Althman Althwin or someone else, I would have firmly refused.  I might even have tried to bribe Director Althman Althwin.  But with Professor Raydin’s involvement… things might be different.

"This puts you in my debt, Stonie."

"Yes.  I will repay you one way or another."

I ended up owing a debt to Professor Raydin, for this ridiculous promise of transferring Anella.  He would eventually collect on that debt, I was sure.  

He wouldn’t go about it in an ordinary way.  He probably was acutely aware of my existence.

"Shall we say, a mana oath?"

"Unnecessary. I know you wouldn’t fall for such a thing."

"What a pity.  A legal oath will have to suffice."

"Very well.  As a mage, I'm well aware of the consequences of breaking this oath."

A legal oath was literally a legal oath. Breaking it wouldn’t result in mana theft, but it would restrict my social freedom as a mage.

"Don't worry.  As a man of my word, I've only broken a promise three times."

"...Three times, you say?"

"Right. When a meeting was about to start, but I had to use the bathroom urgently.  There’s nothing I could do about that."

"That’s pointless wordplay."

Professor Raydin’s expression tightened slightly, and he turned and disappeared as abruptly as he had arrived.  I didn’t know what business he had here, but I figured the Black Mages must have poured honey onto the Wind Empire.  Not every incident that happened within their society was recorded by Jikbakguri’s glasses, so it wasn’t easy to find out.  But if Professor Raydin himself came all this way, it meant that someone with immense influence, or some incident, had taken place in the Wind Empire…

"Wouldn’t I know?"

I pondered the question for a moment, but I still couldn’t grasp it. I could ask Anella later when I had the chance.  After all, she was a Black Mage who came here.

"For now, though…."

I quietly returned my attention to the restaurant.  Hong Biyeon and Jelliel were still locked in a staring contest, lasers practically shooting out of their eyes.

"Ugh… Black Mages and all that, but my top priority now is to appease these women."
