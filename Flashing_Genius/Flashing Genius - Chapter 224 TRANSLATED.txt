### The End of Summer (4)

The rainy season of the Hawol Plains, which had seemed like it would never end due to its extraordinary length, was finally drawing to a close. Now, every morning, one could bask in the warm sunlight, and the sounds of cicadas and sparrows began to be heard outside the window. The end of the rainy season in the Hawol Plains also signified the end of summer, allowing merchants to finally relax and catch their breath.

"…Wow."

At the Lotus Inn, a place known as the heart of the plains, I greeted the morning, gazing in awe at the vast expanse of the Hawol Plains outside the window. Even a single rainbow is a beautiful and wondrous sight, but here, dozens of rainbows adorned the clouds over the vast plains. This was the world's greatest spectacle, visible only in the Hawol Plains.

"It's beautiful… The Hawol Plains are already stunning on their own, but the sight of dozens of rainbows intertwining and stretching out… It's beyond what human expression can fully convey."

Knock, knock.

As I was lost in the scenery, a knock on the door brought me back to reality.

"Yes, come in."

With a polite excuse, the door opened, and waiters dressed in formal attire entered, pushing a luxurious hotel cart that seemed out of place here.

"Breakfast is ready."

"Oh… Yes…"

It was quite overwhelming. I didn't feel deserving of such treatment. The waiters, perhaps unaware of my discomfort, courteously set the meal on the table and quickly disappeared. The breakfast wasn't overly extravagant, perhaps because it was morning. There was a truffle soup, soft and moist bread that seemed softer than clouds, and sandwiches. Despite its simplicity, the meal was of such high quality that it tasted on a different level.

"…It is delicious."

As I slowly sipped the soup, I recalled the events of the previous week. A week ago, when I was trapped in the past, ten years ago, the person who miraculously appeared and rescued me was Jelliel. Why she appeared, I still don't know, but the important thing was that she saved me and hoped I would stay here for the rest of the vacation. She said it was because we wouldn't be able to see each other often once school started again. Honestly, I didn't quite understand. What did it matter if we couldn't see each other often? We weren't particularly close, and although I had saved her father before, I had already agreed to receive proper compensation for it.

No matter how much I thought about it, I couldn't understand. After finishing my meal, the waiters returned, asking if the food was good and if I had a comfortable meal, even making coffee for me. They seemed ready to bow to the ground if I said no, so I just answered that it was fine.

"Phew…"

After sending them away and finally catching my breath, I checked the time. Today was Saturday. Next Monday, Stella Academy would start its new term. It was time to return.

* * *

After returning to the present, I stayed at the Lotus Inn for a week, having lunch and dinner with Jelliel every day. Unfortunately, she couldn't spare more time, so we could only share meals together. I didn't know what was so disappointing about that.

"…Are you leaving now?"

Jelliel always maintained a stern, expressionless face. I didn't know if she was like that only with me or with others as well, but her expression was so fierce that I sometimes wished she would smile.

"I can't attend school from here."

As I casually answered while cutting my meat, Jelliel bit her lip slightly.

"Right…"

"Well, I can visit occasionally."

I really dislike awkward atmospheres. In a meal setting with just the two of us, if both remained silent, it would become quite awkward, so I tended to talk incessantly. Jelliel would always respond with a faint smile, but that was all. I didn't know if she was naturally quiet or if she disliked conversing. After a long while of me talking alone, she finally spoke.

"Recently… I started a business."

"A business?"

She handed me a file. On it, the words "Sharing of Love" were written in large letters.

"This is…?"

"I wanted to start with something small."

"Oh."

Come to think of it, we had talked about something related to this before. I had also thought it would be good to start a welfare project at the Byulgureum Trading Company and was looking for an opportunity to bring it up. But before I could properly ask, Jelliel had already started.

But…

"Small?"

It was far from small. Even a cursory glance at the documents revealed that. They had implemented a seven-layer audit system to prevent donations from being misappropriated, policies to help international disaster relief and volunteers, and it was all very systematic and well-planned.

"I'll start with hunger relief. Then, I'll introduce an emergency support system for disaster relief and families in crisis."

"Oh, oh… Really?"

Even that seemed impressive enough, but she still didn't seem satisfied.

"There are more people in the world who need my help than I thought."

Of course. One of the many misfortunes they face is financial problems.

"But… I still can't fully grasp who needs help and where."

There are limits to information gathering. In a world where information transmission is slower than on Earth and disasters occur frequently, it would be even more challenging.

"That is…"

"I'll establish a foundation."

"Huh?"

"I'll set up branches of the 'Sharing of Love Foundation' worldwide. So that there won't be any place my eyes and hands can't reach."

It felt like the scale was growing larger and larger.

"It may be small, but… I have to start atoning somehow. After finishing this work, I plan to personally get involved."

Jelliel. She had truly come to feel the emotion of 'guilt' and wanted to atone for it herself. That was… the most ideal conclusion I had hoped for, so I couldn't help but smile. Jelliel, who could have driven all of humanity to ruin for her own benefit, had changed to the point of establishing a charitable foundation out of guilt. Of course, this wouldn't completely erase her past sins. But I decided to focus on the fact that she was now performing good deeds. If she did as many good deeds as the evil acts she had committed, or even more, the world would undoubtedly change because of her.

"That's admirable."

So, facing Jelliel, I could smile without any discomfort.

"Oh…"

When I smiled, she also smiled in return. It wasn't a forced smile for the sake of acting, but a genuine one. Seeing her smile so brightly, she looked even more beautiful, befitting her status as a heroine. I was truly glad that Jelliel had come to understand emotions.

On my way back to Stella Academy, I took the train. After talking with Jelliel until late in the evening, I missed the direct airship to Stella. I had no choice but to take a train to a nearby satellite city of the magical city of Arcanium and then use an airship departing from there.

Train travel. It wasn't bad. The Hawol Plains were beautiful, and sometimes I wanted to enjoy such leisure. Looking back, I realized how busy I had been since falling into the Aither World. I had been constantly running around with main episodes, the Twelve Divine Moons, and other objectives, and thanks to that, I had gained many connections.

But it wasn't enough. I took out a pure white orb from my backpack. It was an item I received as a reward for completing the recent episode. While the 'Wheel of Dawn' is a representative item that greatly aids growth, I had used it up like a consumable before, so I couldn't obtain it again. However, the Wheel of Dawn had the disadvantage of only allowing very gradual growth over a long period. Moreover, due to my magic leakage condition, its efficiency was extremely low, so I didn't prefer it even when I played the game.

But this Witch's Crystal Orb was different. Though dangerous, it allowed for a significant leap in growth at once. Since this was reality and I only had one life, I wouldn't do anything extremely dangerous, but I needed to grow a bit faster, even if it was risky.

'While I've been running around, Mayuseong must have powered up even more…'

Of course, no matter how great Mayuseong was, he wouldn't achieve the monstrous feat of reaching Class 5 in the first year. But during the summer vacation, he would gain 'experience.' According to the original game's story, first-year Mayuseong was known to be on par with Haewonryang due to his lack of experience despite having strong power. If he gained experience and developed a rivalry with Haewonryang, a truly terrifying monster would be born. While it would be good if Mayuseong could be guided to the side of good, the problem was that other protagonists would also have made tremendous progress during the summer vacation, while I alone would be standing still.

To play a significant role in the upcoming episodes, I needed to grow faster. 'What was the episode right after the summer vacation again?' I remembered that multiple episodes occurred simultaneously, and the player could choose only one. The most popular story was…

'Urban Legend, I think.'

I pondered for a moment. In the game, you could choose and proceed with only one episode, but would such a convenient feature exist in reality? No way. All the possible episodes might occur simultaneously. In that case, I would have to play a significant role, so I decided to use the Witch's Crystal Orb…

Clunk! Bang!

"Ugh?!"

While I was contemplating with the crystal in hand, a sudden jolt shook the train, causing me to lurch forward. Thanks to my superhuman physique, I quickly reacted and avoided serious injury, but I dropped the Witch's Crystal Orb on the floor.

"Damn…"

As I struggled to lift my head and look out the window, it was pitch dark.

"What… a tunnel…?"

No. A voice echoed directly in my mind, like a hallucination. Realizing it was telepathy, I quickly took out my Terriphone and activated the sword, but it didn't emit light properly.

'Damn…!'

I remembered that my Terriphone had been damaged during the battle with Isaac Morf. I wasn't yet at the level to generate a sword with another staff, so I hurriedly took out a temporary staff and rushed into the train corridor. There, someone in a black robe stood still, staring at me. Though their head was covered by the robe, there was nothing where their face should have been, as if it had been deliberately cut off.

'Who are you?'

He, or she, asked me.

"…I should be asking you that."

Who is this? Why now? As I reached for my waist to put on my Sparrowhawk Glasses and identify them, they extended a hand towards me.

'Stop.'

"Ugh…!"

My hand wouldn't move. Damn, without the glasses, I couldn't identify them.

'I'll ask again. Who are you? Why do you have the Witch's Crystal?'

"Well…"

Though the Witch's Crystal was an item, it became a 'real object' the moment it appeared in reality, like the Sparrowhawk Glasses I was using. That meant it would inevitably catch the eyes of those who knew about the existence of the 'witch,' who had completely disappeared from this world.

'Damn, you idiot…'

Why hadn't I thought of that? I had been short-sighted. In the game, you could take out and put away items without triggering such trivial events.

'…You won't answer.'

Seeing me lost in thought, the black-robed figure seemed to take it as a refusal to answer and spread their hands.

'But you don't have to answer.'

"What do you mean…"

'I am a witch hunter.'

At the completely unexpected words, I widened my eyes, and the black-robed figure summoned a giant black scythe with a staff and said,

'And you, holding the crystal, must be a witch.'

With that, they swung the black scythe, aiming precisely at my neck.
