# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy's Frontline Teleportation

## Chapter 268

### 51. Memory (1)

Kkot Seorin, with her heavy body, headed towards the garden of Ip Hanel. Although she hadn't sustained major injuries in the battle with Cheol Libeon, she had expended an enormous amount of mental energy and mana, resulting in a significant headache. However, the urgent priority now was to check on Ip Hanel's condition.

'This scent...?' Upon arriving at the garden, Ip Hanel realized that something about the atmosphere had changed and tilted her head in confusion. She hurriedly ran towards the interior of the garden, but strangely, it wasn't a bad feeling. Rather, it was quite... a pleasant scent. Of course, no matter how good the scent was in a garden filled with miasma, Kkot Seorin, who was sensitive to the energy of divine beasts, could be certain.

"Ah...!" Ip Hanel. Even though she was still tainted by the miasma, her appearance, praying with her eyes closed and hands clasped, was distinctly different from the last time Kkot Seorin saw her.

"Her heart...?" Although the space was filled with a purple hue, a mysterious energy mixed with green and yellow was blooming like a small flame from Ip Hanel's chest. Although the power was still weak, it was undoubtedly a divine energy. It was the energy of the divine spirit Ip Hanel, capable of perfectly purifying the miasma that was tainting the World Tree.

"You've returned..." Kkot Seorin cautiously approached Ip Hanel and gently caressed her cheek. The mysterious barrier that had enveloped her body had long since disappeared. Although she still had her eyes closed and did not respond, the fact that she did not show any wariness towards Kkot Seorin approaching her was proof that Ip Hanel welcomed her.

Kkot Seorin caressed Ip Hanel's cheek for a while, looking at her face. Since childhood, due to her innate [Yeonjeong Heupinji Che], it was impossible for her to properly face and converse with anyone. The only one who had become her conversation partner was Ip Hanel. Although she had the mental age of a child, she had lived for a very long time, listening to Kkot Seorin's stories with wise and pure eyes.

In truth, they needed each other. Ip Hanel couldn't move from this place, and Kkot Seorin couldn't face anyone due to her curse.

"I'm so glad... truly." Therefore, the happiest person about Ip Hanel's return was not Baek Yuseol or anyone else, but Kkot Seorin. Although the curse had weakened, allowing her to meet various people and share her true feelings, the return of the most precious bond that had supported her through lonely days was the happiest event of all.

And... thinking of the boy who had helped her regain her most precious bond, Kkot Seorin smiled softly. The soft touch of Ip Hanel's cheek felt good. Although they couldn't converse at the moment, it would be fine. Now that her heart had returned, she would soon recover and return to the way she was before.

"Just like before... I'll tell you stories. This time, you tell me your stories too, Ip Hanel." Kkot Seorin kissed the forehead of the praying Ip Hanel. She didn't know when it would be, but she waited for the day they would reunite.

* * *

When he opened his eyes, it was the weekend. The last date he remembered before losing consciousness was also the weekend. Although it could be considered a stroke of luck, Baek Yuseol held his forehead and felt disheartened. From the second semester, all practical courses were reflected in the grades, so absences were quite fatal. As someone aiming to graduate without studying, Baek Yuseol couldn't afford to miss practicals, which were essential subjects.

"Ugh..." Looking around, the familiar space welcomed him. The infirmary of Stella Academy. Stella's hospital gown. As always, after fainting from intense battles, he was here. It was quite surprising that the school didn't impose any sanctions despite him causing so many incidents outside. Recently, he had been thinking that the treatment he received was a bit special for an ordinary commoner student.

'I survived again...' Baek Yuseol looked up at the system message floating in the air. Roughly, it was a message saying that he had cleared an episode that had been brought forward in a very special way and would receive some special reward. But that wasn't important right now. Baek Yuseol recalled the sensation just before he fainted, causing his whole body to shiver.

'I landed a blow on Cheol Libeon.' It was none other than the weak Baek Yuseol who did it. Although Cheol Libeon's absolute invincibility was completely deactivated... he was a martial artist who had honed his close combat skills to survive with just one trait before gaining his protection. Players might have calculated his magic attack power to be only around 10, but his physical attack power was quite high. Even if he was a 9-risk black magician, his skills wouldn't just disappear. Against such a Cheol Libeon, he had managed to stab a sword into his chest. That moment. He still remembered that sensation. It felt as if... the world had slowed down. It was as if the falling leaves had stopped, and he could even capture the swaying shape of falling water droplets. The swirling sandstorm, Cheol Libeon's trembling pupils, the twisting muscles and joints. He could capture all of it. In the frozen world, Baek Yuseol focused solely on Cheol Libeon. His attack seemed flawless, and he had thoroughly calculated Baek Yuseol's teleportation, surrounding him from all sides, but Baek Yuseol could see it clearly. The moment was eternal, and Baek Yuseol controlled his teleportation to penetrate Cheol Libeon's gap.

'I won.' It was such a perfect timing attack that he couldn't help but think so. However, in the end...

'I didn't hit the heart.' Cheol Libeon had dispersed Baek Yuseol's sword strike by precisely spraying his demonic power at the right moment. It was an unbelievable reaction speed. No one had ever reacted to the speed of teleportation before.

'I could have won.' If he had just a bit more experience. If he had properly honed the protection of Yeonhongchun Samwol and could freely control the ability of [Super Concentration]. Some might say it was arrogant for someone with only 3-4 star abilities, but in this world, everything wasn't determined by abilities. Just as a 3rd-class electric mage could defeat a 6th-class electric mage, strategy and experience were important. Baek Yuseol lacked experience. The countless PVP experiences he had accumulated in Aither World Online might have worked against young magic warriors, but they were useless against the real black magician Cheol Libeon. From now on, Baek Yuseol had to fight against such real ones.

'I must completely master Super Concentration.' Baek Yuseol thought that the ability of Super Concentration was too special to have simply derived from the protection of Yeonhongchun Samwol. In the world where everything seemed to stop, he could vaguely sense the presence of Eunsesip Ilwol.

'Combining two protections to create a derived skill... I've never heard of such a case, but it's not entirely impossible.' Baek Yuseol was convinced. If he could properly combine the protections of Cheongdong Sibiwol, Eunsesip Ilwol, and Yeonhongchun Samwol, he could gain a special power that would allow him to stand shoulder to shoulder with main characters.

'There's no time to waste.' Baek Yuseol immediately got up and hurried to the S-Class training ground.

"Oh? Patient! You need to rest a bit more!" "There's no time for that." The nurse who happened to come by tried to stop Baek Yuseol, but he bluntly applied for discharge and left.

"Oh my..." The nurse was astonished, seeing Baek Yuseol, who had forcibly discharged himself despite not being fully healed, heading straight to the training ground. This fact soon spread within the academy, and he became known among the students as the 'crazy guy who trains even when injured.'

"He's more intense than I thought." S-Class's Pung Harang heard the news about Baek Yuseol and chuckled. He had wondered what Baek Yuseol was doing after skipping classes for a whole week, only to hear that he had suddenly fought a black magician, got injured, and was hospitalized. Although the opponent's identity wasn't revealed, the students speculated that it must have been a significant black magician for Baek Yuseol to get injured.

"Even though he went straight to training, he won't be able to participate in the League of Spirits with an injured body, right?" At his friend Mac's words, Pung Harang didn't respond. However, Mac seemed genuinely hopeful that Baek Yuseol wouldn't participate.

"Ah, I really hope he doesn't participate. He sweeps everything whenever he does." "He wasn't on the official player list. It's impossible for Baek Yuseol to participate in the school competition now." "You never know. There could be a special case like Flame. She didn't intend to participate, but her name was forcibly registered because of the Skarben prince, right?" "Ah, I wish I could be on the same team as a girl like Flame. Why is our team full of smelly guys?" "Oh, by the way, I heard Flame is looking for new team members. Should I try to join?" Mac said with a grin, and Pung Harang glared at him.

"What, why are you looking at me so fiercely? Your expression is so scary that it really makes me nervous." "Sorry." "It happens. By the way, are you interested in that girl Flame?" At those words, Pung Harang was genuinely flustered and widened his eyes.

"It's not like that, so don't worry." "Come on, really... Oh, okay. Can you look at me nicely? I don't want to be the first Stella cadet to be killed by a glare." Mac said and then got up and headed to the hallway as if escaping.

"I have the next class!" Whether it was true or because he was scared of Pung Harang's glare, Pung Harang thought it was likely that Mac just wanted to tease him. Pung Harang also packed his textbooks and got up. Although there were no classes on Saturday and it was self-study, they studied even on weekends. They planned to review what they had learned during the week and preview what they would learn in the next week in the study room.

As Pung Harang headed to the S-Class exclusive building, often called the 'Domain,' he saw someone familiar.

"Hey, just trust me and do it once, okay?" "Hmm... I don't know. I'm not interested in sports." "Come on. With your build, saying you're not interested in sports is hard to believe. Hey, Eijel. You say something too." "I don't want to either..." "No, you have to." "Why me...?" "Because you're really pretty." "Well, that's true. But does that mean I have to participate in the League of Spirits?" It was Flame, Eijel, and Mayuseong. As elites who always ranked within the top 5 of their grade, their combination attracted the attention of all the students passing by, who glanced at them curiously.

'League of Spirits... Mac's words were true.' It seemed she was indeed recruiting people for her team. Although Mayuseong and Eijel initially seemed to refuse, Flame seemed to know what would entice them, and they gradually seemed to be swayed, eventually nodding.

"Great! Fill out this application form, and I'm busy, so I'll go first!" Flame handed the competition application forms to Mayuseong and Eijel and quickly ran into the S-Class training ground. Pung Harang tried to ignore it and head to the study room, but the fact that she was heading to the training ground bothered him.

'If it's the training ground, then it's Baek Yuseol.' What could he do now? Of course, Flame would ask him. 'In that case...' It was the perfect timing to face Baek Yuseol fairly. He was also a participant in the Stella League of Spirits and even a contender for the championship. 'I can't miss this good opportunity.'
