### Chapter 192: Everything is Frozen (5)

**Sakwol's Tower, 13th Extermination Squad. Deputy Leader He Yijin Macaron.**

He Yijin Macaron was an elite among elites, belonging to the world's top magical warrior organization that operated in the shadows, even possessing the authority to judge the so-called pinnacle of the magical world, the 'Magic Council'. Her life was driven by interest, and she intended to continue living that way. She was quite fond of adventures. The reason she followed Captain Kaen was because being with him always led to interesting and exciting events.

However, that didn't mean she enjoyed risking her life for adventure. 

"Ahhh! I hate this!"

The icy wind that brushed past her cheek gradually numbed her senses. It was an alien sensation she had never felt before. She hurriedly tried to warm herself with magic, but it was impossible.

"What, what?"

She was genuinely flustered. The mana of the entire world was frozen solid and refused to move.

"This can't be happening... Mana freezing phenomenon? How could something like this happen out of nowhere?"

But there was something even more surprising.

"Where is this...?"

The world was entirely blue. In this blue world, there was a single white bridge. And walking ahead was a familiar backâ€”none other than Bai Yuseol. She unconsciously looked up at the sky. The blue sky was dotted with constellations and the Milky Way. To reiterate, it wasn't sky blue but a deep, deep blue that even stirred fear in He Yijin, making her fingertips tremble.

The terrifying part was that it wasn't the end. Below the only bridge where one could set foot, the sky was also spread out. Both the sky and the ground were filled with constellations.

Thud!

"Ah..."

He Yijin, whose legs gave out, sat down and tried to cover her mouth with her hand, but then she realized the source of the alien sensation.

Crack!

Her hands and feet were slowly freezing.

"What?"

Her fingers, wrapped in icy coldness, wouldn't even think of moving. She hurriedly tried to use magic, but the mana remained frozen and wouldn't budge. Just as He Yijin was about to open her mouth in shock, Kaen placed his hand on her shoulder.

"Get a grip, He Yijin. Are you really a fantasy magician?"

"Captain! My, my hands..."

"Your 'mind' is freezing. Focus and melt your hands with your mind."

"I'll try..."

But even as she closed her eyes tightly and tried to focus, the vivid and excruciating pain of her frozen hands and feet made it impossible to concentrate.

"I, I can't..."

"I'll help you."

Finally, when Kaen held her hand, a warm sensation spread, and the ice slowly melted.

"Ha, ha... Thank goodness..."

"What's there to be thankful for?"

"I thought my hands and feet would freeze and get cut off..."

"That's a useless worry."

"Right?"

"Yes. Because we are already frozen to death."

"...Huh?"

What did he mean?

"Captain? What did you just say?"

"Exactly what I said. This space is close to absolute zero. Physically impossible, but it might be even colder."

"That doesn't make sense! Then how are we alive?"

"Even death has frozen."

What kind of nonsense was this? Unable to understand or accept it, He Yijin tried to ask more questions, but Kaen grabbed her and led her, preventing her from doing so.

"Don't worry. There is a way back."

"Captain doesn't lie, so it must be true, right?"

"Yes."

Captain Kaen was an all-knowing, all-capable magician. So, he would somehow handle this situation too.

"Let's follow Bai Yuseol first."

"Okay..."

The bridge was incredibly long. He Yijin, holding onto Kaen's right hand with both hands, awkwardly followed while taking in the surroundings. A world where time and space were frozen, even death was frozen. The constellations filling the sky and ground were nothing but countless ice fragments. Thousands, tens of thousands of ice fragments formed the constellations. She couldn't help but think, 'It's beautiful,' but quickly shook her head. She didn't want to beautify a dangerous world where she might die.

Ahead, Bai Yuseol was blocked by a large wall of aurora and couldn't move forward. Kaen, dragging He Yijin, approached him.

"...You followed me here?"

"Yes."

Bai Yuseol, who had been staring at the aurora, slowly turned his head and met their eyes. He didn't seem cold at all, appearing even more mentally strong than He Yijin, a mental-type magician. She felt a pang of pride but had to admit it. Bai Yuseol's ability to easily ignore illusion magic was already a level above hers.

Kaen watched Bai Yuseol from more than five steps away, confirming his intention not to interfere. Bai Yuseol turned back to the aurora. He was nervous. Honestly, his heart felt like it would burst, but he held it in.

'...I just have to do what I know.'

Games and reality are different. In the game, he had safely passed this part, but in reality, it could change at any moment. But he had to do it. If he didn't, he would never be able to prevent Hong Biyeon's bad ending.

Bai Yuseol stared at the massive wall of aurora blocking his path. This aurora, which seemed to divide the world in half, was the final boundary. A warning not to approach any further. Ignoring the warning, he placed his hand on the aurora.

"Stop. I don't want you to come any closer."

The voice that echoed through the world made He Yijin collapse to the ground. Kaen didn't fall but his expression hardened in surprise.

"No. I will go in."

"Sigh... Humans again. I'm tired of you."

"Isn't it excessive to say 'again'? The last human who came here was a thousand years ago."

"Really? I have no concept of time, so I don't know what 'a thousand years' means. When was that?"

"The era of the First Magician."

"Ah, I see."

He Yijin, barely calming her trembling body, looked at Bai Yuseol's back. 'What is that...?' Just hearing the voice made her blood feel like it was flowing backward, yet Bai Yuseol stood there, conversing calmly, making her feel a sense of awe.

Of course, Bai Yuseol was also struggling to endure. Despite receiving the blessing of another Twelve Gods, his current abilities were very low. Thanks to sharing the blessing of Flower Frost and carrying a divine artifact, he was slowly adapting.

"Well... It's been a long time. So, what's the matter? Those who could converse with me were often called heroes or 'kings' in history. Are you such a being?"

"I'm a student."

"Hmm. I've never heard of the title 'student,' but it must be impressive enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with kings."

"Something like that."

"So, what's your business? If you came for a trivial reason, go back. I can still melt your frozen souls."

He Yijin urgently shook Kaen's sleeve. 'Did you hear that? Let's go back!' she wanted to say, but her tongue was frozen, so she couldn't.

"But once you cross this boundary... I can't take responsibility. You will be trapped in the cycle of death, wandering the edge of dimensions forever."

"It doesn't matter. Open the way."

"Why?"

"I want to make a bet with you."

The voice fell silent. After a long time, it burst into laughter.

"A bet, a bet! Very well!"

In the game, the 'Bronze Twelve Gods' were as addicted to betting as Mayuseong. When playing Aether Online, the character 'Bai Yuseol' couldn't pass this dialogue scene easily, but the character 'Mayuseong' could.

The keyword was 'bet.'

"Ugh...!"

Suddenly, the aurora in front of them cleared, and a white light seeped out, making He Yijin squint. When she slowly opened her eyes again.

"Is that... the moon?"

In the entirely blue world, there was a giant white moon. Under the moonlight, which seemed to cover half the sky, a white mountain range coiled, but He Yijin and Kaen didn't know it was part of the Iceback Mountain Range in the northern Aether continent. And under that moonlight, sitting atop the mountain range, was the blue giant, the Bronze Twelve Gods.

It was overwhelming. Awe-inspiring. She was afraid to even look up and meet its eyes. He Yijin even shed tears, but they froze instantly.

"I really hate this..."

She clung tightly to Kaen's sleeve. Meanwhile, Kaen stared blankly at the Twelve Gods.

"The Twelve Gods... I've heard many stories in legends, but I never thought I'd face them directly."

Kaen was also quite surprised. How many people in history had conversed with the Twelve Gods? As far as he knew, they were few and far between.

"An interesting proposal, human!"

The Bronze Twelve Gods smiled at Bai Yuseol.

"Alright, if it's a bet, there must be stakes. What do you want?"

"If I win, release the soul of the pirate king Black Belize, who has been wandering the underworld for stealing your artifact."

"Oh, you even know that? Impressive."

The Bronze Twelve Gods didn't ask for details. It didn't matter.

"Still wandering the underworld without perishing. That arrogant pirate is quite something. An ordinary soul would have disappeared long ago..."

After a moment of contemplation, he nodded.

"Fine. It's about time to release him. Now, my proposal."

The Bronze Twelve Gods looked Bai Yuseol straight in the eye.

"Your life. If I win... you must pay for stepping on this sacred ground with your death."

"Agreed."

Without hesitation, Bai Yuseol nodded and stepped into the open boundary of the aurora.

"Captain... We're not going, right?"

"Yes. We're not participants in the bet."

But the Bronze Twelve Gods didn't seem to mind the two spectators, as he didn't close the boundary of the aurora again. It was as if he wanted them to watch.

Bai Yuseol walked confidently towards the Bronze Twelve Gods. Compared to the giant presence, his back seemed infinitely small, but for some reason, Kaen felt Bai Yuseol's shoulders were as large as the mountain.

'Strange.'

The legend of the Bronze Twelve Gods' betting was well-known. Many heroes had challenged him, but none had ever won. So, Bai Yuseol would also lose. But his confident stride seemed to suggest otherwise. It was as if he was certain he would win. Even though losing meant death, he showed no fear, which must have stemmed from his confidence.

'Sigh.'

Reaching the foot of the mountain, Bai Yuseol closed his eyes and took a deep breath.

'Don't give up.'

He recalled the single important note he had written in his [Strategy Guide].

'No matter what, don't give up.'

It might sound easy, but not giving up is never easy. But from now on, Bai Yuseol had to achieve 'not giving up.'

The world was filled with pure white paper. Like a blank sheet without a single drop of ink or speck of dust. As he took his first step towards the mountain, a period was finally placed on the blank sheet. Bai Yuseol walked slowly, and the periods increased, forming a line. Icicles connected the sky and the ground, and even the clouds and waterfalls were frozen in this mysterious world. Bai Yuseol's presence felt endlessly dirty and alien.

And there, the Bronze Twelve Gods greeted him directly. With each breath, a snowstorm arose, and with each blink, the world folded and unfolded. He still wore a smile, as if excited about what was to come.

"Good! Let's start right away."

Thus, an unwinnable bet began.

* * *

The place where the challenge took place was one of the towering peaks within the white mountain range. This peak, sharp as a knife, had two uphill paths like slides, with a large, round ice boulder at the bottom.

The rules were simple. Each person would roll their ice boulder, and the first to cross the 'finish line' at the top would win. This bet was also very famous, and Kaen had read about it in fairy tales since childhood.

'To see this in person...'

Witnessing a legend firsthand was something no one could have imagined. He Yijin also realized the gravity of the situation and stopped whining. She just held onto Kaen's sleeve tightly.

Rustle...

A hexagonal ice snowflake gently fell. When it touched the ground and became one with the vast mountain range, the bet began.

"What?"

He Yijin couldn't believe her eyes.

"What is this... Challenging the Twelve Gods with that skill?"

It was unbelievable. Not because it was impressive, but because it was so pathetic compared to the Bronze Twelve Gods. She had heard countless legends. What kind of people had challenged the Bronze Twelve Gods?

Heroes who dominated an era, pirate kings who ruled all the seas, conquerors who unified continents, swordsmen who pacified the world with a single sword, and great magicians who reached the heavens. Many legends had challenged and lost to the Bronze Twelve Gods. But at least they didn't show such a pathetic difference in skill.

Bai Yuseol was slow. While the Bronze Twelve Gods rolled his ice boulder at a terrifying speed, the black-haired boy barely moved it an inch. He seemed to struggle, as if even that was too much for him.

'Ridiculous...'

Did he come all this way to make such a ridiculous bet? If that was all he had, there was no hope. Bai Yuseol would lose his life.

"Captain. Let's go back... huh?"

But Captain Kaen was watching Bai Yuseol with an unusually serious look.

'...Why?'

It felt like a waste of time to have come this far. What was there to see? The Twelve Gods were fascinating, but staying here and getting caught up in this seemed more dangerous. Wouldn't it be better to run away quickly?

But.

After an hour, He Yijin also noticed something strange. The Bronze Twelve Gods had reached the top in just 30 minutes, and the outcome was clear.

'...Why isn't he giving up?'

He had already lost. Yet Bai Yuseol continued to climb the sharp cliff at a turtle's pace. Was it because the ice boulder was several times larger than his body? Sometimes he slipped, sometimes he fell, but he always got up and moved forward.

'Does he not know he lost...?'

A day passed, then two. When a week had passed, He Yijin finally realized.

'He knows he lost, but he's not giving up... to see the bet through to the end?'

She looked up. There, the Bronze Twelve Gods stood without moving a single step, watching the boy. He would probably stay there until the human gave up, died, or reached the top.

'Crazy. It's impossible. With such a weak body, there's no way he can reach the top...'

It was a miracle for a human to push such a large ice boulder, but the premise of climbing the slippery, sharp ice peak was absurd. There was nothing to see. He would lose. So, they should leave quickly. But despite these strong thoughts, her legs were firmly rooted in place, unable to leave.

As two weeks passed, snow spirits gathered to watch the reckless human boy. After a month, glacier spirits gathered, and after two months, the stars in the sky seemed to be watching. During this time, He Yijin neither felt hungry nor sleepy. Time itself had frozen.

All the spirits watched the reckless human. They neither cheered nor encouraged him. The boy didn't stop. He climbed and climbed as if he would climb forever.

Suddenly, a rainstorm hit. Thunder and lightning struck. A blizzard raged. An avalanche occurred. But Bai Yuseol didn't stop. He looked almost dead. It was a miracle he was still alive. But he kept climbing. Towards the place where the Bronze Twelve Gods stood, towards the top.

Finally, after three months, when Bai Yuseol reached the top and stepped on the 'finish line,' the Bronze Twelve Gods laughed.

"Impressive, human."

"Huff, huff...!"

Despite the pain that felt like he would cough up blood, Bai Yuseol staggered and faced the Bronze Twelve Gods. Then, he smiled and joked.

"Ah, damn... If I had come... five minutes earlier... I would have won...!"

"Hahaha!"

The laughter of the Bronze Twelve Gods shook the heavens and the earth. It was a laugh of pure joy.

"What are you talking about, human?"

The Bronze Twelve Gods pointed to his ice boulder with his finger and said calmly.

"You won."

Only then did He Yijin and Kaen see it. The ice boulder of the Twelve Gods... had not even crossed the 'finish line.'

"What...!"

She was so shocked that she screamed without realizing it. Yes. From the beginning, this bet was absurd. The Bronze Twelve Gods was the ruler of ice. Rolling ice on a cliff was something he could do without even touching it. So why did he bother to compete with heroes in history through bets?

To truly win against them? To hope they would defeat him? No, no. He just... had no one in this world to bet with. Regardless of victory, he wanted someone who wouldn't give up and would bet with him.

The Bronze Twelve Gods approached his ice boulder, pushed it with his finger, and crossed the line.

"Too bad. If I had five more minutes, I would have won."

He said.
