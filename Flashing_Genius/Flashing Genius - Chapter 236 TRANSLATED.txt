### Chapter 236: The Witch (3) - Weekend

Hong Biyeon, who had returned to the Frost Palace in the capital city of Tehalan, Adolevit, headed straight to the special intelligence facility. This place, accessible only to direct royal bloodlines, required utmost caution as leaking internal information could result in severe punishment, even for royalty.

"……Greetings, Princess."

The special intelligence facility was managed by robed barrier mages. Though their combat abilities were subpar, they could handle high-level barriers, making it nearly impossible for even an 8th-class mage to break through. Of course, a 9th-class mage would be a different story, but such beings were not considered in the security measures.

"Please sign the confidentiality agreement."

The agreement promised to keep the palace's information and data confidential. Having seen it a few times before, Hong Biyeon quickly skimmed through and signed it.

Creak!

The barrier mages silently stepped aside and tapped their staffs on the ground, opening a steel door to reveal a dark space.

Click!

As she stepped inside, the sound of her shoes echoed loudly. With a flick of her hand, flames scattered in the air, lighting up the torches and revealing the vast storage room. Though it contained various documents, boxes, magical books, and items, none of these interested Hong Biyeon. She walked deep into the storage until she reached a small room labeled [Top Secret].

This room was also surrounded by a special barrier, but it was of no concern to Hong Biyeon. Without hesitation, she opened the door and entered. Though it seemed like there weren't many documents, each one was a critical secret that could be fatal to Adolevit if exposed. She carefully sifted through the documents, like a farmer harvesting crops, until she found what she was looking for.

The document started without any title, a characteristic report by Hong Shihwa of Adolevit. She was known for writing reports like diaries, a style the queen had approved. Hong Biyeon frowned as she read through it, finding it filled with irrelevant details.

‘Does she really think this is a diary…?’

The report was full of mundane details about meals, orders, and conversations. No wonder the document was so thick. Suddenly, Hong Biyeon's eyes stopped at a particular sentence. It was filled with traces of emotional turmoil. Hong Shihwa must have been suffering from depression at the time. But that was odd. The Hong Shihwa she knew was a sociopath who would ruthlessly eliminate anyone for her benefit. Such a person being swayed by emotions? Something was off from the start.

Nevertheless, Hong Biyeon continued reading. The report detailed events that had occurred at the time, including things that could have been hidden. 

‘The White Fox Flame Spirit?’

She had definitely heard of it. It was a legendary beast sealed by the 12 mages of 'Morph' long ago, and the Morph family currently managed the seal. 

‘No way. It can't be.’

Hong Biyeon shook her head, but the diary confirmed her suspicions. The White Fox Flame Spirit's fire was also mentioned. She kept turning the pages, not wanting to read more of the irrelevant details, but the diary kept drawing her in. The document was filled with melancholic and negative emotions, making it seem like the writer could die at any moment.

‘This can't be.’

The past had been manipulated. Hong Shihwa had not gone to subdue the blackened Isaac Morph but to forcibly unseal and subdue the White Fox Flame Spirit. She had even pressured Isaac Morph to do so. Was that necessary? Such questions were pointless. For Hong Shihwa, anything that had even a slight value to her was worth gambling on, even against a god.

The report ended there, with many pages left blank. 

‘What is this? What happened?’

Hong Biyeon hurriedly flipped through the pages until she reached the last one. The writing was crooked, smudged, and barely legible. Only then did she fully grasp the disgrace of Hong Shihwa from ten years ago.

“What… She failed the subjugation? If the allied forces were annihilated, there should have been a disaster in that area. What happened?”

The disaster, though caused by her, was something Hong Shihwa could do nothing about, and someone else had to bear the full responsibility.

“Ha.”

It was a ridiculous story. Hong Biyeon turned the page, finally reaching the last one.

“What is this… The one who resolved the incident wasn't Hong Shihwa or Isaac but an 'unknown man'? What an absurd conclusion.”

The document ended with a cryptic mention of a 'mysterious wheel,' leaving the identity of the man unknown. A mage capable of subduing both the White Fox Flame Spirit and Isaac Morph. How many such beings could exist in the world? At least a 9th-class mage, or perhaps even higher.

‘A silver staff…’

Such staffs were common and provided no clue. The 'mysterious wheel' was a better hint. Some mages fought using special summoned creatures. A 9th-class mage who wielded a wheel. Such a person was rare and unlikely to reveal themselves easily.

Hong Biyeon returned the diary to its place and sighed.

‘Now I understand why Eizel is looking for this.’

Somehow, Eizel had likely uncovered the truth about the incident at the Morph estate. However, sharing this information with her was impossible. Exposing a top-secret document would not go unpunished. But she didn't intend to keep this secret from Eizel forever. She wanted to tell her, not out of kindness, but to see Hong Shihwa's downfall.

The streets of Arcanium were filled with students on the weekend. Despite the scorching summer sun, teenagers roamed the streets, some looking for the 'Witch's Restaurant.'

“We should do some club activities too.”

On a hot day that felt like it could drive one mad, Baek Yuseol spoke with a dying look, while Mayuseong cheerfully showed him some flyers.

“I found a good restaurant.”

“What is it?”

“How about this? It's famous for its 'Special Revolver Fire Shot' menu.”

“What kind of ridiculous food is that?”

Is it even food?

“They say it's super spicy. It's trendy.”

“Pass.”

“Then how about 'Let's Monkey Dance'? They say it tastes like a monkey dancing on your head.”

“Wow. That sounds delicious.”

“Shall we go there?”

“Pass.”

Eizel, who had been watching quietly, looked bewildered. Both Mayuseong, who chose suspicious menus, and Baek Yuseol, who listened seriously, were far from ordinary.

“Ha… I think we should go to a normal restaurant. How about the place I found?”

Eizel showed them some flyers. She had found restaurants that served mostly ordinary dishes, with a lot of cheese.

“You're really into cheese, huh.”

“What are you talking about? It's just that they say it's delicious… and famous…”

“Pizza spaghetti sounds good.”

At Mayuseong's words, Eizel almost nodded but held back and replied.

“I've heard it's good. It might be worth trying…”

Baek Yuseol laughed and snatched her flyer.

“Then let's go there. I like pizza spaghetti too.”

“Me too.”

With both Mayuseong and Baek Yuseol agreeing, Eizel felt her ears heat up. 

‘This isn't right…’

In the end, they headed to the restaurant Eizel wanted, with Baek Yuseol and Mayuseong leading the way. Eizel followed, feeling like they had adjusted to her preference.

“This way.”

The alleys of Arcanium were famously complex, but Baek Yuseol never got lost, as if he had a navigation system in his head. His excellent memory and intelligence were impressive.

As they followed Baek Yuseol, something caught Eizel's eye.

[Witch's Restaurant]

The sign, glowing orange, was unmistakable.

“..Huh?”

Why was it here? Last time, it was in the opposite academic district.

‘Does the restaurant really move?’

If so, was she lucky? Finding it twice when others struggled to find it even once.

Submitting a club activity report about the Witch's Restaurant seemed like a good idea, but the place gave her an uneasy feeling, so she looked away.

“What’s wrong?”

“Nothing. Let's go quickly.”

Fortunately, Baek Yuseol and Mayuseong hadn't noticed yet, so she hurried past. Eizel quickened her pace, hoping never to encounter the Witch's Restaurant again.
