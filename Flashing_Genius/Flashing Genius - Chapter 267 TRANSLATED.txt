# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 267

## 50. Noble Soul (17)

When a massive object moves, noise inevitably follows. What if an ultra-large flying cruise ship, 400 meters long and 55 meters wide, were to move? Strangely, the white airship floating in the sky made almost no noise, as if it were considerate of the injured passengers.

“Is that the 'Saint Holic'? What a trivial name for a model...”

Aryumun Blushun, the president of the Magic Society, had a unique hobby of collecting airships. His expertise was such that he could identify the manufacturer, tuning, production date, and engine type just by listening to the engine sound. The Saint Holic was one of the airships Aryumun disliked.

“Why don't you like it?” a wizard asked. Aryumun clicked his tongue and replied, “Because it's a Stella airship.”

Stella Academy was notorious for its extravagant and often insane projects, backed by immense capital and technological prowess. They created ultra-large airships, known as 'flying notarized cities,' for student relaxation, built the subspace 'Stella Dome' for mere practice, and installed dozens of miniature warp hole gates on campus—things unimaginable for other magical institutions. The Saint Holic was one of Stella's 'useless extravagances.'

The Saint Holic was an airship designed to rescue students dispatched externally, akin to an ambulance. But did other magical institutions not create such things because they lacked funds? No. While they might not engage in the madness of covering their campus with miniature warp holes, they could easily create something like the Saint Holic. They simply didn't because it was unnecessary, meaningless, and useless. Would a simple rescue operation with a regular combat model airship be a big deal? It was all for show. Stella's principal, Eltman Eltwin, loved showing off, hence the creation of such airships.

“Click. Do they think people will find them impressive for carrying around such airships? Ridiculous...”

As Aryumun criticized Eltman with tired eyes, the wizard watching him shook his head. 'Aren't you also collecting airships to show off...'

Soon, the airship landed, and particles gathered in the air to form a staircase. When two magic warriors appeared on the stairs, Aryumun showed an amused expression.

“Well, well... If it isn't Stella's first-year class S instructor, Yihanwol, and Stella's chief knight commander, Arain. Even within the academy, these two are exceptionally special magic warriors.”

The reason the Saint Holic had suddenly come to the orchard of Namuhwaran was to personally fetch the injured Baek Yuseol. It was strange enough that the Saint Holic moved to fetch a single student, but having two of Stella's top magic warriors personally involved? This piqued Aryumun's interest.

Yihanwol stood before Aryumun and gave a short bow, while Arain extended his hand for a handshake. “Nice to meet you.”

“Indeed... It's a pleasure for me too. It's not every day you see two young heroes standing together.”

“We are also a fading generation now.”

“Hey, don't say such things in front of an old man who's almost dead. Cough!”

Aryumun coughed violently, and a large amount of blood poured out, startling the surrounding wizards. When the wizards and nurses rushed to support him, he waved them off. “Ah, it's nothing. Just a normal hemoptysis, don't worry.”

Though it seemed far from 'normal' to cough up that much blood, the wizards had no choice but to step back since Aryumun insisted.

“Where is Baek Yuseol?”

“Right, right. The young heroes have come personally for a precious talent, and the old man is wasting time.”

Aryumun led Arain, Yihanwol, and the accompanying wizards to the 'Fruit of Healing' located at the highest point of Namuhwaran's orchard. Despite its grand name, it was essentially a regular hospital. However, thanks to the mysterious fruit borne by the World Tree, elves could heal their wounds and recover from fatigue just by resting inside.

Although Baek Yuseol did not benefit from such special effects, a medical wizard had treated him. “This way.”

When they opened the door to the innermost room, a woman sitting by the bedside reading a book looked up and met the wizards' eyes. Though she was covered in a white mask, black robe, and dress, Arain and Yihanwol instantly recognized her identity.

“...Greetings to the king of all divine beasts and fairies.”

“Ah... Nice to meet you.”

Ggotseorin stood up and lightly bowed to the wizards. “You've come in grand style. Don't you think so, Elf King?”

“Tomorrow's newspaper will have a big headline, won't it?”

Despite Aryumun's sarcastic remarks, Arain and Yihanwol showed no reaction, though they were aware. Moving the Saint Holic just to fetch a single student and personally deploying themselves would undoubtedly cause a significant media stir. But there was no choice. Their deployment was... a direct order from Stella's principal, Eltman Eltwin.

Though he had never done so before, Eltman suddenly issued an order today to excessively protect Baek Yuseol, which was quite puzzling. Nevertheless, they had to faithfully carry out the order.

“How is the student's condition?”

“Much better. The attending physician said his regenerative ability is several times superior to that of an ordinary wizard.”

Yihanwol nodded, as he already knew about Baek Yuseol's exceptional regenerative ability due to his frequent hospitalizations.

“...What happened to the enemy Baek Yuseol fought?”

This time, it was Arain who spoke. After a moment of hesitation and glancing around, Ggotseorin cautiously replied, “The opponent was the invincible Cheolriban. Baek Yuseol inflicted a fatal wound on his chest but was ultimately defeated and collapsed.”

“口 人.”

Arain and Yihanwol were shocked into silence. Even Arain, who usually maintained a strict poker face, couldn't hide his surprise.

“If it's that Cheolriban... Could it be the one I know...?”

“Yes. It's the Cheolriban you're thinking of.”

Aryumun, still nursing his wound, said, “It's truly strange. Even when the Elf King and I joined forces, we couldn't land a proper hit on him... Yet he suffered a fatal wound to the chest from a mere student. If it weren't for the memory fragment shown by the Elf King, I wouldn't have believed it.”

Cheolriban's tales were legendary. The only dark mage to survive a battle against the Dark Mage King. The one who single-handedly brought down the impregnable fortress of Kanadan, which stood for 300 years. A man with an invincible body...

Though Baek Yuseol had faced and defeated many strong dark mages, those were feats any elite magic warrior could achieve. But Cheolriban was different. Facing him meant risking one's life, and even then, it was uncertain if one could inflict even a scratch on him... He was the strongest man.

“Personally, I hope this incident doesn't become public knowledge. For the student's safety.”

Yihanwol and Arain agreed. Though Baek Yuseol had indeed inflicted a fatal wound on Cheolriban, his actual ability was nowhere near Cheolriban's level. He was an exceptionally intelligent student who combined his brilliance with the unique trait of teleportation to create unimaginable synergy. This duel with Cheolriban was likely just another stroke of luck.

If Baek Yuseol were to be labeled as the 'wizard who wounded Cheolriban,' dark mages seeking that honor might come after him.

“Even if we try to keep it quiet, those who need to know will find out. But let's try to handle it as quietly as possible... friends.”

After saying this, Aryumun patted Arain and Yihanwol on the shoulders and left the room. They stood there, looking at Baek Yuseol for a moment.

“...He's going to be something great.”

“He's also dangerous.”

Perhaps knowing this, Principal Eltman Eltwin was personally looking after this student. Though the exact details were unknown, they thought Eltman's judgment was correct, even if it was a hassle to come all the way here.

“Then, we will take Baek Yuseol and leave.”

Yihanwol politely greeted Ggotseorin, took Baek Yuseol, and disappeared. She watched their backs for a long time. Specifically... Baek Yuseol's.

'In the end, we couldn't spend time together...'

She had resolved to spend a joyful time together over the short weekend, but nothing had gone as planned. Though it was disappointing and left her feeling empty, she consoled herself, thinking it couldn't be helped. After all, Baek Yuseol's safe return was more important now.

'Ah, Iphanel...!'

Suddenly remembering her friend, she hurriedly stood up. Since Iphanel was the reason the Namuhwaran orchard had started to become tainted, she had to address it immediately. With everyone gone and no reason to stay, Ggotseorin also hurried towards Iphanel's garden, leaving the room empty.

...Or so she thought.

Flicker! Before the shadow of the curtain swayed and white eyes appeared.

-Hmm...? Am I late? I came to see this kid named Baek Yuseol, but am I late...?

It was the voice of a young girl. However, anyone who heard this voice would be certain. She was no ordinary girl. The fact that she could easily penetrate the temporary barrier set by Aryumun and send her thoughts meant she was at least a 9th-class wizard.

-By the way, Eltman, that little brat, is quite possessive of his things, isn't he? Windy? Are you here?

When the girl called out, a gust of wind blew, revealing a woman. It was Windy Melsirun, who had previously come to deliver a message to Soya. Wearing a robe that was almost like a skimpy outfit, she greeted her master with a seductive smile.

“Yes, Mother. Did you call?”

-Didn't you properly convey my message to Toa?

Toa Legron. Though the girl referred to the master of the Green Tower as if calling a child, Windy reacted as if it were natural.

“Of course, Mother. I clearly conveyed that you were interested in Baek Yuseol and wanted him delivered in perfect condition.”

-Right? Then what is this nonsense...?

The girl laughed. Though her clear and refreshing voice might seem odd with an old woman's tone, it didn't feel strange at all.

-Is he rebelling...? I know Eltman Eltwin recently reached the 9th class as a spatial mage. If he has also stepped into the 'heavenly realm,' he would be quite difficult to deal with.

-Hmm, I hate troublesome things...

She was old and tired, unable to win a direct fight against a young mage like Eltman. But Eltman had something to protect, while the girl had nothing. So if she pushed unilaterally... Eltman would surely surrender first.

-Hehe, let's see how far you can go to protect a mere student, kid.

After saying this, the girl closed her eyes, and the eyes flickering in the curtain disappeared as if they were an illusion. Watching this, Windy stood up and looked out the window. The engine sound of the Saint Holic, which had just taken off, was quietly heard.

“What is it about that kid... that makes such great wizards, who could weigh the world, so interested?”

Though Windy couldn't understand with her limited perspective, she would follow her mother's will. Because... it seemed more fun that way.
