## Chapter 269: Memory (2)

When playing RPG games, it is quite common to do preparatory work before starting a boss fight. The most representative examples are 'doping' and 'buffs,' which are essential preparation processes to defeat a tough boss monster. In some games, dozens of people gather to buff a single player going on a solo raid, preparing the highest quality food and potions to help with doping, making the preparation process quite lengthy. Fortunately, in Aether World, such processes were minimal.

In Aether World Online, doping was as simple as drinking a potion or eating a meal to boost one's condition. It was a significantly differentiated aspect compared to other RPGs, where pre-buffing before battle was common. The only thing wizards needed to prepare for battle was casting magic, and they could focus solely on their spells. The same was true for the character 'Baek Yuseol.' Baek Yuseol had never done any pre-preparation while playing the game.

"〇으.."

However, now, Baek Yuseol needed pre-preparation. Even though he used to fearlessly face dragons or the strongest wizards with just a sword, now he couldn't do anything without meditating before a fight.

First, [Tae Ryung Divine Art]. This technique, which drastically increased attack power by enhancing mana leakage delay and rapidly increasing mana circulation within the body, required at least 10 seconds of meditation. Additionally, to use [Ultra Focus], at least 1 minute of meditation was necessary. In fact, the time had significantly reduced thanks to his continuous training since returning to Stella. Initially, it took nearly 10 minutes to reproduce this skill.

It's quite strange. In the imminent crisis with Cheolribeon, both Tae Ryung Divine Art and Ultra Focus activated simultaneously without any preparation. Why can't it be done now? Even trying to recreate the same situation by recalling that time, it just doesn't work. Is there such a big difference between actual combat and practice? Or is it the fault of the short-haired protagonist staring at him from the side?

It seems this is the case. Flame is the culprit. Otherwise, there wouldn't be such a difference in concentration. She was sitting about thirty steps away, kneeling quietly and staring at him without moving, making even Baek Yuseol, who usually didn't care about others' gazes, quite uncomfortable.

"……Hey."

When Baek Yuseol, who had failed to concentrate, spoke, Flame opened her eyes wide.

"Oh, huh? Am I in the way?"

Baek Yuseol was about to answer yes, but seeing her look flustered with guilt, he found it hard to say so.

"No, it's not that……."

"Should I move away?"

"Yeah."

Then she really moved twenty steps away and knelt down again. The same situation repeated. The gaze was still burdensome, making it quite difficult to switch to Ultra Focus.

"Hey…… can I talk to you?"

"……You already did. What is it?"

"How about taking a break?"

"How long have I been doing this to take a break already?"

"What time do you think it is now?"

"…?"

Right after waking up in the hospital, he ran straight to the training ground, performed Ultra Focus, reported back to Ihanwol, returned to the dormitory to sleep, and then came back to the training ground early the next morning to start Ultra Focus again. It had been several hours.

"Is it lunchtime?"

"No. You need to go back to the dormitory."

"Why?"

"If you don't return by ten, the dormitory supervisor will go crazy."

"……It's already ten?"

Flame pointed to the clock in the corner of the training ground. It was 9:48 PM. Twelve minutes left until the dormitory supervisor's wrath.

"Eh……?"

What is this? It felt like he had just started Ultra Focus, but time had flown by.

"You haven't even eaten. What if you collapse?"

"No… has that much time really passed?"

"You didn't know?"

"Not at all."

Baek Yuseol looked at the clock in disbelief, then turned to Flame. She seemed to have been there just before he started training. He would completely forget her presence whenever he entered Ultra Focus mode, but her presence was always felt when the meditation ended.

"So, you've been there the whole time?"

"Why? Wasn't it about participating in the League of Spirits?"

"Yeah."

"……You could have done it tomorrow. Did you have to waste a precious weekend?"

He asked, genuinely bewildered, but Flame answered without any change in expression.

"Well, it wasn't a waste of time."

"……Really."

"Yeah. I don't know how much longer I can see you like this. You've been too reckless lately."

"What did I……."

"Ah, but now I really have to go back. I don't want to get scolded by the dormitory supervisor."

With that, Flame stood up, stretched, and left the training ground alone. Baek Yuseol watched her back for a moment and then sighed deeply.

"League of Spirits……."

He had heard about it recently. After being forcibly made to participate by Crown Prince Scalven, they were recruiting members to change the team. They had somehow persuaded Eizel and Mayuseong, making the current number three. If Baek Yuseol joined, it would be four. The minimum team requirement for the League of Spirits was five. They must be struggling with a lack of members, so it made sense why Flame had spent the entire Sunday in such a boring place to recruit even one more person.

"I guess I have no choice."

Baek Yuseol had tried to avoid interfering with the League of Spirits as much as possible. There were several reasons why he disliked 'Rios.'

First, when five humans gather, there is always one trash. Like a famous line from a comic character, he was sick of team games and preferred one-on-one duels.

Second, that trash was Baek Yuseol himself. In one-on-one, Baek Yuseol's individual control was excellent enough to maintain the top rank. However, in team games, Baek Yuseol was different. Due to a lack of communication with teammates and a habit of playing alone, he often did not participate in battles and acted individually. Although he carried the team several times, he trolled more often. For Baek Yuseol, who was more accustomed to individual activities than cooperation, team games were poison.

But what about this time? Although he still lacked confidence in cooperative activities…… if the team members were Flame, Eizel, and Mayuseong, it would be different. It didn't mean he had confidence in cooperating with them. Those three protagonists had such overwhelming individual abilities that they didn't need cooperation. Flame's team might be at a disadvantage compared to other teams that focused on cooperation, but their superior physical abilities would cover even that disadvantage.

"Hmm. I guess I can just join and ride along."

It would be rude to refuse when Flame had gone to such lengths. Also, she was the only friend who shared his hometown.

"Hmm, this might be a good thing."

He needed an opportunity to use the Ultra Focus he had been practicing in actual combat, and the League of Spirits would be an excellent training ground.

Morfran Forest. Adolevit Red Tower Guardian Occupation Site.

Looking at the tall and desolate tower built solely to manage Morfran Forest, Hong Biyeon licked her red lips with her tongue.

"It's my first time coming here."

This place was the last remaining legacy and trace of the Morfran Grand Duke's family, which was exterminated ten years ago. Due to being tainted by powerful dark magic, the Adolevit royal family periodically undertook purification work.

"It doesn't feel good."

It wasn't because of the dark magic. Rather, there was almost no dark magic in this place, which was strange. The mountain breeze gently blowing, the clear air, and the sound of mountain birds chirping here and there. A squirrel hiding an acorn met her eyes but quickly hid up a tree in fear. For a place tainted by dark magic that required annual purification, it was strangely peaceful.

"Welcome, Princess Hong Biyeon. I am Kaizen, the purification ritualist from the Holy Federation. Pleased to meet you."

The purification work was usually handled by the first princess of the royal family, Hong Siwha, but for some reason, Princess Hong Biyeon was participating this time, causing a stir in public opinion. Although it didn't show on her face, she could tell just by looking at their expressions.

"They are wary of me."

Hong Biyeon's lips curled up. It had been a long time since she was treated like this. After meeting Baek Yuseol, her position in the palace had become solid, and there were hardly any people who could treat her like this.

"There's no one connected to me here……."

The Morfran purification work was conducted in secret under the leadership of the Orkan Duke's family, so the noble wizards of the Hong Siwha faction were gathered here. Entering the Red Tower, Hong Biyeon felt a sense of nostalgia for the first time in a long while. The cold and sharp atmosphere she felt during her childhood in the palace. When she reached the top of the tower, an entire rooftop made of windows greeted her. There was no proper furniture here. The entire wall was made of windows, with a red magic circle engraved on it. The spell inscribed on it was quite ominous, making her feel very uncomfortable.

And, standing with his back to such windows, was an old man. The old man, wearing a red pointed hat, opened his narrow eyes and met Hong Biyeon's gaze.

"……Mage Terriban."

"Welcome, Princess. It's been a long time."

"Yes… it's been a while."

"It feels like just yesterday when the young princess lit a flame on her fingertip, and now you've grown so beautifully. Haha……."

That was not a compliment. Mage Terriban. Once the chief wizard of the Adolevit royal family, he taught flame magic to the princesses. He was kind and gentle to the other two princesses but was extremely cold to Hong Biyeon. Instead of proper teaching, he constantly scolded her, saying things like relying on talent alone wouldn't work, and that her way of handling magic might lead to an outburst later. He was one of the people who tore young Hong Biyeon's heart to pieces with his harsh words.

Terriban approached Hong Biyeon slowly, laughing softly. Flinching, Hong Biyeon took a half step back involuntarily, sweating and biting her lip.

"Oh dear, if you react like that, this old man… will be very hurt."

"……You've changed a lot, Terriban. Are you trying to act like a kind grandfather now?"

"Nothing in the world remains unchanged, Princess. I, too, am merely following the laws of nature and changing."

"Human nature doesn't change, Terriban. That disgusting mask is tiresome, so why don't you stop?"

"Haha, I understand. I was too harsh on you when you were young. But I hope you understand one thing. I did it all for you, Princess."

"……That's creepy."

She dismissed him and turned to the purification ritualists waiting behind her.

"Enough with the unnecessary formalities. I want to start the purification ritual right away. Is everything ready?"

"Yes, Princess. But may I say one thing?"

"Go ahead."

"Before starting the purification ritual, you need to activate the 'Hwa Ryungjin' with the royal family's emblem……."

He trailed off. The reason was obvious. The person who had been activating the Hwa Ryungjin was Hong Siwha, a 7th-class wizard. In contrast, Hong Biyeon was only a 4th-class wizard. Achieving that level at the age of seventeen was impressive, but it was far from enough to handle the family's magic alone.

"I can do it."

"Are you sure?"

The nobles looked at her with doubtful expressions.

"Well…… even if you fail, it's not a big deal. We can always call Princess Hong Siwha. Let's proceed for now."

Just from their tone, she could tell. They didn't trust Hong Biyeon at all. The fact that they hadn't thoroughly prepared for the purification ritual showed that they were sure she would fail to activate the Hwa Ryungjin.

"Let's do that then."

But Hong Biyeon answered their reaction indifferently. She was tired of getting angry and reacting impulsively.

"It's simple. I just have to show them."

Show them who Hong Biyeon is. Show them the wizard Hong Biyeon. Show them the princess Hong Biyeon. She just had to show them and prove it.

"That's very easy for me now."
