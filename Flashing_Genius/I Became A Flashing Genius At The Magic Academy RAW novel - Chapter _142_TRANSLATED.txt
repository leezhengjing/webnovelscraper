### Chapter 142: Summer Vacation (6)

It was quite a vivid experience, but it felt like a dream, as if I had been asleep for a long time. In fact, was it not a dream? The idea that someone had turned back time thousands of times to save the world seemed like something out of a novel. Each time one turns back time, they must offer their memories as a price. All the life and memories accumulated so far crumble like a sandcastle. How could one repeat such a process not just once or twice, but thousands of times? Could I do it?

"Impossible."

Even this one life is precious and desperate, yet to repeat it two, ten, a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand times. If I did that... all my emotions and soul would wear away and disappear.

"......Ah."

Eijel opened her eyes groggily. The red sky filled her vision. The horizon dyed by the sunset was truly beautiful. The three moons hanging in the sky were not all full moons. It also meant that another evening had come after a night had passed. Eijel, who struggled to lift her upper body, shivered with a fever and then discovered Hong Biyeon lying next to her. She looked quite emaciated from not having had any nutrition for a day, but even in her unconscious state, she appeared elegant and graceful.

"Ugh..."

Hong Biyeon, who twitched her eyebrows a beat late, seemed to regain her senses and forced her eyelids open. She lay there blankly for a moment after meeting Eijel's eyes, then hurriedly got up. Eijel turned her head to look at the edge of the altar. There, Flame, who had woken up earlier, was sitting crouched, hugging her knees.

"......Are you awake?"

Although her expression was not clearly visible due to the shadow covering half of her face, it was easy to guess that she had a very dark expression. Eijel forced strength into her trembling legs and sat down beside her. Then, she forced a smile and asked jokingly.

"Why do you look so... dead?"

"Well, it's just... you know."

After hesitating for a moment, Flame moved her lips.

"......Because I saw something like that."

Flame let out a deep sigh. She felt a pain in her heart as if it had been blocked because she had seen Baek Yuseol's past in the Library of Stars, but at the same time, she felt a strange sense of relief as most of the questions she had harbored were resolved. Why were his memories and knowledge so tightly intertwined? Why did he seem to know everything yet not know anything? It was because he had lived through the same time over and over again for such a long time.

At first, she thought Baek Yuseol had returned for Eijel. The second time, she thought he might have returned for her. Perhaps, all of them were correct. In the countless regressions, Baek Yuseol must have shared love, affection, and emotions with many people. But all of them were also wrong. He was moving for everything, including all those things. How deep a sense of duty must he have to drive himself to the end of hell and fight a lonely battle?

"......Do you know?"

When Flame opened her mouth, Eijel and Hong Biyeon looked at her silently. Unlike her usual playful and lively self, she had a heavy and subdued atmosphere, so no one interrupted her.

"Once, I seriously asked that man. What his wish was. What his goal was."

At that time, he said, "I want to live. Normally."

At that time, Flame seemed to have been convinced of Baek Yuseol's regression. But until now, she hadn't realized the weight of it. She thought anyone could say they wanted to live. But... how heavy must the words "I want to live" be when they come from someone bearing such a harsh fate? It felt so distant and unattainable that she couldn't even comprehend it.

"You don't have to be so gloomy."

This time, it was Hong Biyeon who spoke. Leaning against a pillar, she spoke while facing the sunset.

"Now that we know about him... we just have to prevent Baek Yuseol from turning back time again."

"......How is that possible?"

"It's simple."

Her tone was quite indifferent.

"We've seen the end of the world. We just have to prevent it from happening."

"Ah..."

So that we never again drown in the sorrow of losing everything. So that we never again have to struggle to forget memories in a world where no one remembers us. So that we never again turn back time. We just have to strive and strive to save everything so that the world we live in now doesn't perish. Baek Yuseol is not alone now. If he had struggled alone through countless lives, now three of the world's most talented young witches know the truth about him.

Hong Biyeon looked into the eyes of Flame and Eijel one by one and said,

"Until then, unfortunately... I might need a little help from you guys, who are as useless as cat's paws."

At those words, Flame and Eijel's expressions softened somewhat.

"Do you have to ask for help in such an annoying way?"

"Right. It ruins my appetite."

"......What did you say?"

Hong Biyeon glared with her red eyes, but Flame stood up and stretched her back.

"Well, then. Now that we have a task, let's go eat since we're tired from sleeping all day without food?"

"Sounds good!"

When Eijel also stood up, Hong Biyeon had no choice but to follow them. Even so, she couldn't help but think. With this completely mismatched trio, how far could they help Baek Yuseol? That... even Baek Yuseol wouldn't know. Because in no history so far had such a combination ever been formed.

* * *

Honestly, I was flustered when a girl who looked like a middle schooler approached me for an autograph, but I couldn't help but feel good. No matter what my past life was, the fact that I had gained some popularity in this life wasn't a bad sign, right? Such simple and foolish thoughts began to rise.

It was a foolish thought.

The moment I made eye contact with the girl named 'Anella,' a skill was activated.

[The trait 'Blessing of the Spring of Eternal Youth' has been activated and detected the trait 'Rebirth of Nightmare.']

[A nightmare is invading your mind. Do you want to reject it?]

At first, I wondered what this was. The Spring of Eternal Youth appeared like a firewall antivirus program in the air, asking me to choose Yes or No. Naturally, I should have chosen 'No.' But the peculiarity caught my attention. In other words, even though I knew the original game, I had never heard of a trait called Rebirth of Nightmare, which meant I couldn't do anything if it invaded my mind...

Curiosity got the better of me, and before I knew it, I had pressed 'No.'

And now, here I am.

"Ahhhhh! Save me, save me! Save meeeee!!"

The girl's screams echoed loudly in my head. I was vividly watching Anella, who had collapsed on the floor, screaming.

"Is this... my mind?"

My mental world resembled the sea. There, Anella triggered the 'most terrible trauma' I had experienced through her trait. But for someone like me, who had lived a peaceful life in the modern world, the most terrible trauma was nothing more than the moment when the power suddenly went out while I was trying to defeat a boss monster after three days of retries. Honestly, even in this world, I hadn't experienced anything that could be called terrible.

But strangely enough, I did have trauma. However, those were...

"Ugh!"

Stab! Ugh! Crack!

Numerous, countless deaths were my trauma. Deaths so terrible that even I, who was watching, felt dizzy and nauseous. Anella was experiencing that pain vividly over there.

"What the hell is that...?"

I had never experienced such trauma. That wasn't my trauma. I turned my head away, thinking that, but this was undoubtedly my mental world. The Blessing of the Spring of Eternal Youth proved it. Therefore...

I had no choice but to face 'my trauma' again.

Crunch!!

Being torn apart alive by a giant monster with blood-red teeth. Thud!! Failing to control a blink and crashing into a wall, dying. Whoosh!! Being engulfed in flames and dying. Bang!! Being smashed by a goblin's club and dying. However, in none of those moments of death did 'I' scream or cry for help. I just accepted death with an emotionless face. Only then did I realize that those deaths were familiar.

"Aither World Online."

In that place, even if you died once, you could revive after a slight penalty or return to a designated save point and play the game again. Those countless deaths were... the deaths of the 'character Baek Yuseol' that I, Baek Yuseol, who lived in the modern world, had played.

"But why are those traumas?"

It was an incomprehensible phenomenon. Those deaths were just deaths in a game world, weren't they? Moreover, it was an all-ages game, so there had never been a proper depiction of blood. But those deaths, so vivid that it was terrifying to even face them... what were they?

"Save me, save me..."

Anella screamed and eventually fainted, and my head throbbed so much that I couldn't hold on any longer.

"Stop showing me."

Then, as if it were a lie, all the traumas turned into smoke and disappeared. Only then could I barely calm my chest and think about how to get out of the mental world.

"...Huh."

I made eye contact with someone. It was 'me.' A version of me that was slightly different from both the me on Earth and the me in Aither. A version of me that looked like what I might look like after suffering for about ten years. He looked at me quietly, then turned and started walking somewhere.

"Hey, what are you? Wait, you're me, right?"

But he didn't even think about stopping and kept walking somewhere. This place was a vast ocean, and no matter how much I ran, it felt like I was running in place, but he was moving away from me at an incredible speed.

"Wait, who are you! Hey! Answer me!"

I ran towards him with all my might, but 'I' didn't even pretend to hear and moved farther and farther away, like a mirage, until he disappeared.

"Hey! ...Huh?"

And when I came to my senses, I was back in the cafe. Thud. The girl, Anella, who had lost consciousness, fell towards me, and I caught her in a daze, staring blankly into the air.

"What the hell...?"

I couldn't understand anything.
