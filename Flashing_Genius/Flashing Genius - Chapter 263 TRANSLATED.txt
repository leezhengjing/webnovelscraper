# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 263

## 50. Noble Soul (13)

The king of all divine beasts, spirits, fairies, and elves, Huaseorin. People speculate that her abilities are on par with a 9th-class mage within the World Tree. However, that is a slightly mistaken belief. The 9th-class 'magic warriors' have reached their position through countless experiences and accumulated knowledge, but Huaseorin has reached it solely through meditation with faith and patience, which is a very decisive difference.

Of course, she has perfectly memorized various military strategies and combat manuals, but can she really conduct battles like a textbook in actual combat? Absolutely impossible.

"...The blessing of Damgaltowol." Huaseorin bit her lower lip slightly and hardened her expression. Behind her, wings resembling a mix of green and purple butterfly wings sprouted, allowing her to fly freely in the air. She thought it would be advantageous to stay airborne to counter Cheolribeon, who belonged to the earth element. But reality was different. As long as Cheolribeon wished, the earth was always there. He could summon the earth as a foothold from anywhere and even drop meteors from the sky, so the advantage of flying was almost nonexistent.

Rumble...!!

The aerial fortress, which had been providing solid support fire from the air through Aryumun's summoning ritual, crumbled like a sandcastle. It wasn't even a special attack; it happened with just one shout from Cheolribeon. Aryumun used a unique strategy of summoning various summoned beasts and objects to fight in the present world, while Cheolribeon had a special ability to automatically and perfectly defend against all attacks. But who could have written down such special abilities in a manual?

"Create an opening in the enemy and exploit the gap. Then you will win." This is the most basic magic battle principle explained on the first page of the combat manual. But would such 'basic principles' work against Cheolribeon? This fight, where common sense didn't apply, was extremely difficult for Huaseorin. No matter how much she thought about it, she couldn't think of a way to break through Cheolribeon's absolute defense. Damgaltowol's defense was perfect and seemed endless. Even without his conscious effort, a protective shield would automatically unfold, consuming almost no mana. In contrast, Huaseorin and Aryumun's mana was gradually depleting. Unlike them, who used their own mana to control the World Tree or perform summoning magic, Cheolribeon had the earth bear the burden of mana.

"...If you keep fighting like that, this land will dry up." Huaseorin spoke with difficulty, and Cheolribeon replied with a bitter smile. "Sorry. The land I pass through is always in drought. But since you're here, it should be fine, right? You can bless the land."

How could he speak so nonchalantly? "Then give up immediately!" Huaseorin swung her arm down with all her might, and hundreds of purple fluorescent butterflies sparkled and fired beams towards him. Boom! Following that, green acidic liquid shot out like bullets from the roots of the World Tree towards Cheolribeon, causing smoke to rise, but there was still no sense of breaking through the shield.

Is this... absolute invincibility...? Unbelievable. How could such an existence be in this world? I thought the term 'absolute invincibility' was just a nickname. If he truly is absolutely invincible... how on earth can we capture such an existence?

Buzz-!!

Huaseorin instinctively looked up at the vibration coming from the sky. The shape of the clouds was strange. They took the form of a 'palm' as if someone had intentionally assembled them. The cloud fist slowly clenched its palm into a fist, and a magic circle filled the empty space, creating a giant 'blue lightning sword.'

"...The Blade of Judgment." Aryumun's voice cut through the air. Realizing his intention, Huaseorin hurriedly wrapped her arms around her chest. "He's crazy...!" Perhaps he wanted to say that he had been controlling his firepower because the World Tree was right next to him. He began preparing a powerful magic that could overturn the entire area. Huaseorin had no choice but to move the roots of the World Tree to push the ground a little further away and create a protective shield with the roots, and then...

Boom!!!

A giant blue lightning bolt struck the ground, completely shattering the floating land into pieces. "Ugh..." Huaseorin, who had spread her wings and flown into the air, blocked the shockwave with a light purple shield in front of her, but she couldn't withstand it and was blown backward. She barely managed to stop just before colliding with the World Tree, and then, realizing the situation, she opened her eyes wide.

"Ah... The terrain about 1 km away from the World Tree... was completely collapsed and destroyed. Seeing the deep crater left after the impact of a giant meteor, who could dare think it was a wound created by a single human? It wouldn't be strange to mistake it for divine punishment from an angry god. No matter how powerful Huaseorin or Cheolribeon were, they couldn't unleash magic of this magnitude.

"This is the power of a 9th-class mage...!!" She hurriedly spread her wings and flew towards the crater. Blowing away the rising smoke with wind, she saw Aryumun kneeling on the distant ground. "Ah...! Are you okay?" "Cough!" As she hurriedly channeled the green life energy, his condition seemed serious. Did he suffer internal injuries while using the magic just now?

"Damn... I didn't expect him to counterattack." "Counterattack... you say?" Throughout the fight, Cheolribeon had rarely attempted direct counterattacks. Even then, it was just flipping the earth in response. "Yes. I almost forgot his true ability." "Ah." Cheolribeon, blessed by Damgaltowol, had the nickname of absolute invincibility, but that wasn't his true ability. It was just one of the many abilities he possessed.

"Thought control..." Aryumun, clutching his abdomen, slowly removed his hand. The sharp blue lightning that pierced through it was undoubtedly the magic Aryumun had struck from the sky. "What... happened?" "He intercepted part of the magic midway. Annoyingly, he has a 'thought' type ability... Cough!" Aryumun, supporting himself with his hand on the ground, spat out blood, and Huaseorin hurriedly used magic to control him. The wound was so severe that it was dangerous if not treated immediately. The mana veins were twisted in such a way that an ordinary mage might have lost their magic forever. Fortunately, he was a 9th-class mage proficient in mana, so it wasn't to that extent... but if Cheolribeon counterattacked further in this state?

'Dangerous.' The priority was to protect him rather than treat him in this urgent situation. No matter how much Aryumun had a history of invading the World Tree, she couldn't let his life be wasted. Huaseorin, with blue and light purple mana in her hands, hurriedly turned around and stared beyond the thick fog.

Step- From there, Cheolribeon, covered in wounds, slowly walked out. Even he couldn't completely ignore the power of such a powerful lightning bolt, as his body was covered in scratches. 'Only that much damage...!' It was shocking that he had only suffered that much damage even after being hit by a magic that could be considered a catastrophe. Of course, that was only Huaseorin's thought.

'The Elf King seems fine, and the mage is retired.' Cheolribeon checked his condition with eyes full of fatigue. '...The earth is not responding.' It was the first time. A being that completely shattered the blessing of the earth, which was almost like absolute invincibility. This was not an ordinary blessing. It was a protective shield imbued with the true intention of Damgaltowol, one of the Twelve Divine Moons, so perhaps this mage could even compete with the true Twelve Divine Moons. But that was it. Even though his protective shield was completely shattered, Aryumun had fallen, and the Elf King seemed to have almost no strength left.

'...If I continue fighting, will I die?' Huaseorin still seemed capable of fighting. Thanks to the World Tree constantly blessing her, she was continuously supplied with mana, just as he was loved by the earth. 'I'm not sure.' He shook his head. If he made a mistake, the worst situation could occur where their lives would be cut off before he died. Cheolribeon didn't want to stain his hands with more blood. How many lives had been lost because of him so far? A village was overturned because a child threw a stone at him by mistake. A city sank entirely because someone accidentally spilled water on him. Whether it was bumping shoulders on the street, someone shouting at him, or someone else, or someone else, or someone else. Just because it was deemed a 'threat' by Damgaltowol's overprotection...

How many, how many lives had been lost? He tried to live without facing people as much as possible. He wanted to live quietly in a place where no one was. But by then, too many grudges had accumulated, and countless avengers appeared and lost their lives in vain. Running away, and running away again. Even if he kept running away, they kept appearing in front of him, throwing away their precious lives.

"You and I both seem tired, so let's end the fight here." Cheolribeon clenched and unclenched his fists, checking his mana state, and then turned around and left. "Then... I'll be going now." "What...!" He really seemed to have no will to fight, quickly disappearing into the fog, and Huaseorin quietly watched his retreating figure. "How... I was prepared to risk my life, but he suddenly gave up and left just before the fight ended. What on earth is he thinking?"

Cheolribeon disappeared so far that his mana trace couldn't be felt at all, and Huaseorin, finally relaxing, collapsed to the ground. Thud! "Ah..." Staring blankly at the ground, Huaseorin's eyes shook greatly. If such a monster invaded her World Tree, could she really stop it? Such a fundamental question arose.

"...Do you understand now? That is a black mage loved by the Twelve Divine Moons." Aryumun spoke while struggling to stop his bleeding. "In this world... unless there is another adversary blessed by the Twelve Divine Moons, it's quite troublesome with pure ability alone. Damn it." "...Another adversary blessed by the Twelve Divine Moons, you say?" "Yes. The abilities of the Twelve Divine Moons have infinite potential. As far as I know, such a person doesn't exist in this world..."

Aryumun stopped speaking there, grimacing in pain. Normally, Huaseorin would have hurriedly healed him, but her mind was too complicated to do so. 'The love of the Twelve Divine Moons... Isn't there someone right here who receives such love? None other than herself. She had received so much love that she was given a 'curse,' but thinking about it, that was also just a small part of the great abilities of the Twelve Divine Moons. 'If I can control the blessing of the Twelve Divine Moons...'

Hope bloomed on Huaseorin's face as the fog completely cleared. "Damn, we lost the fight, but the sky is unnecessarily clear..." Aryumun said that and then completely collapsed backward, and Huaseorin belatedly approached him and began treatment. "We need to... pursue him... It's rare to have a chance to capture Cheolribeon." As Aryumun muttered, still unable to let go of his lingering attachment, a loud noise echoed from a distant place. "Ugh, what is it...?" Aryumun, whose pain worsened due to the shock, grimaced but didn't turn his gaze away. Then, belatedly recalling something, Aryumun opened his eyes wide. "No way..."

The fact that a loud noise was heard from the place where Cheolribeon had left meant that someone had started fighting him again. But an ordinary mage couldn't stand against him. "This is bad..." Realizing this, Huaseorin and Aryumun's faces turned pale.
