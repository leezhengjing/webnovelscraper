### A Gamble with Time (3)

Back when Baek Yuseol lived on Earth, he resided in Seoul. However, just because he was a Seoulite didn't mean he had visited all the tourist attractions in the city. Deoksugung Stonewall Walkway, Yeouido Underground Secret Bunker, Hangang Yeouinaru, Yanghwa Bridge... There were so many tourist spots in that small piece of land. So, what about the capital of the Elven Kingdom, the Cradle of the Celestial Tree?

The capital, Cloudflower Cradle, was so enormous that calling it a metropolis was an understatement. Its grandeur was not in its width but in its height. The atmosphere of Cloudflower Cradle changed according to the disposition of the reigning Elf King. If a stern and rigid Elf King ruled, the city would appear monotonous as if it had been copy-pasted. Conversely, if an Elf King with a great artistic sense ruled, the city would be beautiful and vibrant.

The current Elf King, Flower Serin, belonged to the latter category. She loved beautiful and pretty things and was always immersed in melancholy. As a result, Cloudflower Cradle was also beautifully decorated. Thanks to this, even when playing Aither World Online, players often visited it as a screenshot spot.

So, in the distant future, if Baek Yuseol ever had the leisure, he thought he might enjoy traveling to such scenic spots.

"Hoho, you came quickly."

"Yes... But I never dreamed I would be touring the sights with Elf King Flower Serin."

"Shall we go then?"

She spoke with an excited voice, her face flushed with anticipation. She wore a black cursed veil dress, and her face was covered with a veil, so there was no worry about the curse of the Love-Absorbing Body leaking out. Moreover, she had stayed up several nights preparing for this day, so it was understandable that Flower Serin was excited.

"Of course."

He was a bit flustered, but it wasn't all that bad. This was one of the ways to properly utilize the first divine artifact of the Spring of Blooming Red.

Just as the 'Heart of Winter' of the Bronze December and the 'Fire Spirit Flower' of the Red Summer had their divine artifacts, the Spring of Blooming Red also had the 'Petal of a Gentle Heart.' This artifact didn't grant the power to freeze the entire coast of Levian or burn the land to ashes, but it had a very special ability to calm the mind.

Of course, he knew very well that mishandling a divine artifact could lead to a catastrophe, so he had never properly touched it since obtaining it. However, the Spring of Blooming Red had said, "Feel the same emotion in the same space and time while holding the divine artifact."

When Baek Yuseol first heard that, the first thing that came to mind was PVP. The thrill and excitement when two menâ€™s magic clashed in the same space and time, feeling the intense competitive spirit!

But Flower Serin had a different opinion.

"Then, shall we tour the city together?"

"Tour the city?"

"Yes! It's a kind of date."

"Ah... Yes..."

He realized for the first time that Flower Serin could smile so purely and joyfully. And even now, she had a face full of happiness.

"Let's go quickly."

The dignified and weighty queen was nowhere to be seen. Under the veil, Flower Serin was just a girl excited about touring the city.

"Yes, well... Let's go."

He wasn't sure if this would activate the effect of the first divine artifact, but he decided to follow her, thinking of it as a summer vacation. There was nothing urgent at the moment anyway.

"I know the tourist course well, so just follow me."

"Oh, good. It's my first time."

It was pitiful to think that the queen of the Celestial Tree had never confidently toured her own city.

"...But, are you sure it's okay?"

Just before leaving the white castle, Flower Serin hesitated one last time. If the cursed veil didn't function properly, a catastrophe could occur.

"You lived fine in the castle, didn't you?"

"That's true, but..."

"Or what? You said you sneaked out, but do you want to go back without doing anything?"

"That... can't happen. I sneaked out without the Lime siblings knowing, so I can't go back now..."

In the end, Flower Serin made up her mind and confidently stepped into the city. Her stride down the main street was so confident, as if she was showing herself off to the people. But...

"Wait a minute. That's a road for carriages."

Sure enough, a driver of an automatic carriage honked the horn immediately.

"Hey, lady! What are you doing on the road?"

"Lady?"

Flower Serin was shocked by the unfamiliar word and froze.

"Oh, really."

He quickly ran over and pulled her onto the sidewalk.

"Uh, huh? What?"

"Your Majesty... That's a road for carriages only."

"What? When I patrolled, I walked alone on that road..."

"At that time, they cleared the road for you."

But not now. They didn't know the existence of the queen at all. They just thought of Flower Serin as an ordinary lady passing by.

"Oh..."

Finally, Flower Serin could see the surroundings. No one paid attention to her. Even though she walked among so many people, no one was mesmerized by her.

"Oh..."

Only then did she realize that her curse had weakened. Thump. Her heart pounded. The feeling of being alive. Yes, from the beginning, Flower Serin liked walking through crowded places. She dreamed of this every day, and finally, that dream came true.

"...Follow me for a moment."

"Yes?"

Flower Serin grabbed Baek Yuseol's wrist and quickly walked somewhere. They weaved through the streets and crossed many crowds. People enjoying the summer festival, singing and dancing in the streets, people who came with lovers, families, or friends. After pushing through the countless crowds, Flower Serin finally found a quiet place.

At the end of the World Tree branch, a place a bit away from the city center. However, because the view was wide open, it was a beautiful place where the moonlight shone brilliantly beyond the horizon.

There...

"Ah, it's refreshing."

Flower Serin suddenly took off her veil. Although she confirmed in real-time through the messages of the fairies and the World Tree that there were no people around, it was still a very bold action for Flower Serin, and Baek Yuseol was unconsciously surprised.

"Wait a minute. Is that okay...?"

"Hoho, it's refreshing and so nice."

"I'm glad you like it, but..."

Her smiling face under the moonlight was so beautiful that if she declared she would destroy the world right now, he felt like he would have to bow his head and say, "Yes! As you wish, Your Majesty!"

"Sigh..."

Flower Serin, letting the wind blow through her hair, looked at him with the horizon of moonlight behind her.

"Baek Yuseol."

"...Yes."

"I think I'm really happy right now."

"Is that so."

"Actually, I'm not sure. This is the first time I've felt this way... I'm even doubting if this is what happiness feels like."

She turned her head and quietly looked down at the Cloudflower Cradle below. Above and below. People full of joy were singing, dancing, and living happily in the city. And now, she could quietly blend into that.

"Maybe it is."

"Right? There's no way this pleasant feeling isn't happiness."

She smiled bashfully and twisted her hair. The more he looked, the more the image of 'Elf King Flower Serin' crumbled. The kind and decisive charismatic Elf King was smiling purely without any worries.

He didn't know if the Flower Serin he knew was right or if the Flower Serin in front of him was her true self...

He didn't know anymore.

"Sigh... It's refreshing."

She closed her eyes and enjoyed the cool breeze for a long time. If someone saw her bare face now, they wouldn't be immediately cursed. The effect of the first divine artifact was about to activate soon anyway.

So he let Flower Serin stay as long as she wanted, and after a while, she started putting on her veil again.

"Then... Shall we really enjoy the city tour now?"

"Yes."

That night, he led Flower Serin around every corner of Cloudflower Cradle. They ate skewers sold on the street, blew shiny balloons into the sky, and set off fireworks. They enjoyed the small but not-so-small pleasures of life.

Until the moonlight that filled the sky faded, he stayed with her.

...In the far east, in the barren wasteland. More than a hundred expedition members suddenly arrived in this abandoned land, which no adventurer who valued their life would visit.

Crackle, crackle!

- Ah, this is Sprout Team 2. The newly developed and almost first-time-used walkie-talkie crackled with noise. It seemed to threaten that it would really explode if used any further.

But the girl who received the transmission, Jellyel, calmly squeezed out its performance.

"Confirmed. Report."

It had been almost a month since she led the expedition of the Starcloud Merchant Guild.

- We detected magic that matches the data exactly. Analysis results confirm that part of the ruins is buried deep underground. We sent three teams to infiltrate.

"...Is that so?"

Jellyel felt her heart sink as she confirmed the report.

"Oh!"

"Oh my god."

"To think it really exists..."

The archaeologists and many explorers who were listening to the transmission around her hugged each other and danced. The barren wasteland was full of monsters, and the climate was extreme, making it a very harsh journey. But now that they had results, they couldn't help but be happy.

Jellyel was also happy, but she tried to remain as calm as possible.

'Not yet.'

They had just found the entrance to the ancient ruins of Karmenset.

Baek Yuseol. The journey that started because of that boy was slowly coming to an end. Although he had cursed her terribly, he was also the boy who gave her the blessing she most desired in life.

"Miss Jellyel. Are you planning to enter the ruins yourself?"

"To obtain what I want, I must defeat the 'Wraith of Karmenset' in the final gate and win a game of Soul Chess."

She had trained in Soul Chess all her life for this. Although there was one person in the world she couldn't defeat... she was still one of the best in the world, wasn't she?

'I can do it.'

No.

'I must do it.'

She couldn't collapse after losing a game of Soul Chess when she was so close to her lifelong goal.

'I will definitely do it.'

Jellyel stood up with a firm resolve. Her eyes had a blue gleam that was different from usual.
