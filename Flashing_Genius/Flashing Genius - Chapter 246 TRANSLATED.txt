# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 246

## 49. Witch (13)

Even if the sky falls, there is always a way out. I came to believe that saying when my parents passed away when I was fifteen. Looking back, it’s still a painful and melancholic memory... but it doesn’t seem like the right time to reminisce, so I’ll pass on that. Anyway, I want to say that I’ve always lived with the mindset of “What’s the worst that could happen? Death?” No matter what happened, there was always a way to solve it, and each time I overcame a crisis, I comforted myself by saying, “I did it again.”

Even in Aether World, it was no different. I’ve gone through countless hardships and trials that can’t even be compared to what I experienced on Earth, but I’ve overcome all those adversities and am standing here now. However, this time, it might be a bit difficult.

“Reverse it!”

- Insufficient mana to perform the action.

“Then find a way, anything!”

- No solution exists.

Hearing the cold voice of the sparrow glasses, I bit my lip hard. Watching me, Melisha, who was riding on a broom, smiled leisurely.

“Do you understand a bit now?”

It’s a bluff. Melisha no longer has the strength to use magic. If I decide to attack, I could kill her immediately. But... would that act have any meaning?

[Impossible]
[Impossible]
[Impossible, impossible, impossible...]

I couldn’t help but feel disheartened by the “impossible” messages filling one side of the sparrow glasses. No matter what I did, it was impossible to break the illusion barrier. Even if I killed Melisha, I would be forever trapped here. This situation wasn’t recorded in the sparrow glasses. The “illusion barrier” was originally designed for the convenience of boss battles, where the player would enter, defeat Melisha, and the barrier would automatically collapse. But now, I was trapped in the “boss room” created for the boss battle, unable to leave. Is this the difference between a game and reality?

I always tried to be careful not to confuse the game with reality, but this variable occurred so significantly. How should I deal with this?

“Why? Have you already lost your will?”

I kept my mouth shut and looked up to meet Melisha’s eyes.

“If you want, kneel and beg. Then I might...”

[Teleport]

“...Huh?”

Not wanting to see her flapping her mouth anymore, I flew up into the sky, and she hurriedly retreated. As expected, I pulled out a witch hunter’s magic tool and threw it into the air.

[Claw of the One-Armed Monkey]

Swoosh! A net shaped like a monkey’s arm sprang out in mid-air and entangled Melisha’s body. However, she clicked her tongue and lightly shook her head, tearing the net to pieces. But it was enough to bind her momentarily, so I approached and swung my sword, but Melisha twisted the direction of her broom and fell downward.

There is a slight gap between teleports. No matter how hard I try, there is an unavoidable delay to exert the delicate control of distance and clear focus. Most magicians, when facing me, would catch that brief gap, and Melisha was no different. Judging this as my gap, she tried to attack, but...

Click!

‘Beaker of Sahalen.’ An ancient artifact cherished by the witch hunter, it has the characteristic of sealing the opponent’s soul with its barrier sealing technique, but that only works on the weak. The true power of this artifact is revealed when the evil spirits sealed inside it explode.

Whoosh! I threw the beaker at Melisha, who was aiming her broom at me. Sensing the danger too late, she hastily deployed a shield.

‘It’s useless.’

If it were a magic shield made of physical force, it might be different, but an illusionary and fictional shield made with insufficient mana cannot block it.

Clang! ...Boom!

A very cute impact sound for an ancient artifact. However, the effect was certain.

“Ah, ugh...”

Melisha, pierced through by the Beaker of Sahalen, suddenly clutched her body as if it were being crushed and began to cough up blood.

“Cough...!”

If her mana had been even slightly intact, it would have been difficult to hit her with such a clumsy throw, but Melisha was already exhausted, so I managed to hit her by chance. Coughing up blood, Melisha fell to the ground and rolled into a corner of the Arcanium building before collapsing. I didn’t miss the opportunity and teleported to her, thrusting my sword into her chest with all my might.

Thud!!

“Gah...”

I missed. The sword’s trajectory was twisted by the hastily created barrier, stabbing her shoulder instead. And it was quite shallow.

Crackle!!

I wanted to stab her vital point again, but red lightning began to flash from her body, so I had no choice but to jump back.

“Huff, huff... You disgusting bastard... hiding such an artifact...”

Barely supporting herself with her broom, Melisha staggered to her feet and looked up, sweating profusely, but still forcing a smile.

“Heh, heh. Sure, you can kill me. So... what are you going to do?”

Crash!!

Glass shards burst out in mid-air, and cracks began to form in the space. Through the torn gaps, a dark void was visible. A space where nothing exists. The true form of the illusion world created by Melisha’s magic. Even if her life ends, this world will never disappear, remaining in a form of emptiness without direction, time, space, or color... tormenting me forever.

“Hmm? Say something. Do you think killing me will change anything? You’ll live in that hell forever without being able to die.”

There’s no way. Killing Melisha was neither a second-best nor a worst option, just a venting of anger. But I pointed my sword at her. She no longer had the strength to fight, so I could decapitate her in a few moves. But why couldn’t I move?

Guilt? That couldn’t be. I had no qualms about killing evildoers and was confident I wouldn’t hesitate when the moment came to cut someone down. But... if I really cut down Melisha here, I feared that all methods would disappear. That scared me.

“Do you still think there’s a way? You’re really... just like any other magician.”

It’s a variable. This was just a small accident caused by an unforeseen variable. If so, I need to introduce another variable. I’ve always been a variable in this world, so it should be possible this time too. Even though the sparrow glasses couldn’t reverse the magic, and none of my physical attacks worked. Somehow. If I keep racking my brain to come up with a method, just like before, I’ll find a way to create a ‘variable’...

‘...There’s no way I can create one.’

Knowing that no magic could interfere with the illusion barrier, I had reached my limit. All the means and methods I had were blocked. Even the sparrow glasses couldn’t come up with a method, and I had no magical knowledge. I hadn’t even experienced this situation in the game... As an ordinary ‘normal person,’ there was nothing I could do. That was the conclusion I reached. Thinking that far, the strength in my hand holding the sword loosened. As I let the Terrifon sword droop, Melisha’s lips curled into a long smile, like a shadow cast by the setting sun in the twilight sky.

“Correct.”

“You can’t do anything.”

“Did you get arrogant because illusions don’t work on you? So what now?”

Melisha began to approach me step by step.

“None of your magic works on me. No matter what magic, artifact, or magic tool you bring out now, it’s useless in front of my illusion!”

She reached me and smiled kindly, baring her teeth.

“How does it feel to experience the helplessness of being unable to do anything?”

Melisha whispered to me.

“That’s how I felt.”

She was right. There was nothing I could do alone. No matter what I did... there was no way to create a ‘variable’ that would completely overturn the story here.

“Surrender.”

It was quite a sweet temptation.

“Kneel and offer me your soul. It’s better than wandering here forever. You’ll live a life worse than a bug as my slave forever... but I promise I’ll kill you someday. Isn’t that a pretty good deal?”

Yes. She wasn’t wrong. I couldn’t use magic. Probably, even if I stayed here for tens, hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of years without dying... I wouldn’t be able to use magic. Even though I possessed items with most of the magical knowledge of this world, ironically, I couldn’t use magic. Someday, after a very long time, the sparrow glasses might analyze the illusion barrier. Then the glasses would say, ‘If you use such and such magic in such and such a way, you can escape.’ At that time, I would despair again. Despair has no bottom. The moment even a tiny bit of hope shines, I’ll be lifted high into the sky and then fall again. For me, who couldn’t use magic, a method that required using magic was nothing but a torture of hope, and that would... completely destroy my ego.

“Choose.”

It was the last chance. She completely dropped her guard, even turning off her shield, and opened her arms to me. If I swung my sword, I could cut her neck immediately.

‘Try killing me if you can.’

She was confident. Confident that I wouldn’t swing my sword. She was right. I had no intention of swinging my sword. She was the only remaining escape route. So. At the moment of making the final decision. ...Suddenly, something black fell from the sky.

Thud!!

“...Huh?”

“Huh?”

Melisha and I almost simultaneously looked at the spot. It was a familiar figure. ‘Black short hair, black eyes.’ Wearing a black Stella uniform with a beautiful golden border... a small girl.

‘Flame.’

She struggled to lift her head. Without even needing to turn her gaze, she looked straight at me. Was it a coincidence? Looking at her smiling foolishly, I didn’t have any doubts.

“Wait...”

To be precise, there was no time to doubt. My sword was shining again, and it drew a trajectory straight towards Melisha’s chest.

“This is wrong-”

Thud!
