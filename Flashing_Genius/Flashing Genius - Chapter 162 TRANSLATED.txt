### I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 162

#### 38. The Aftermath of the School Competition (2)

After the school competition ended, Eltman Eltwin followed Anella's report and directly sought out a Stella Dome official named 'Kabaren' for interrogation. Of course, it wasn't a peaceful method.

"……ル윽." Drip, drip! Blood soaked the floor. The scattered pieces of flesh were cooling, and the pool of blood had long since coagulated. Yet, Kabaren did not die. He was a dark mage.

Eltman looked at him with cold eyes. To him, killing a dark mage was akin to a human swatting a mosquito, so he felt no guilt whatsoever.

"There were more vermin hiding in Stella Dome than I thought?"

"Ugh, cough… So, please, spare…… Crack!!"

"Do not speak without permission."

"Ugh…!!"

As Eltman gently clenched his fist, Kabaren's body twisted unnaturally. His eyes bulged as if they would pop out, and he could only groan without even being able to scream.

'This is troublesome…… The dark mages' technology is developing at an alarming rate, to the point where it's almost grotesque. Wizards can no longer detect dark mages who have infiltrated society, allowing them to quickly establish themselves in the magical world. It's truly astonishing. Those who couldn't resist the impulses of pleasure and desire, causing dozens of terrorist acts daily, have now developed technology to hide their identities and blend into society as soon as it was available.'

'Anyway, Anella…… That little exchange student girl is truly a blessing. Thanks to her report, we were able to root out several dark mages hiding in Stella, including Kabaren. However.'

'That girl is also suspicious.'

There was no physical evidence, but the suspicion was strong. However, without concrete evidence, he couldn't pursue it. There was no way to reveal someone as a dark mage unless they were killed directly. So, for the time being, he decided to leave her be. Anella seemed to have a favorable impression of Baek Yuseol, so she wouldn't cause any major trouble for now.

Crack! As he clenched his fist tightly, Kabaren's body twisted and disappeared without a trace. Eltman turned his head silently and left the place. Having dealt with the dark mage who orchestrated this incident, it was now time to handle the aftermath of the school competition.

* * *

After the school competition ended, there was another person who received attention alongside Baek Yuseol.

"Cadet Dok Cheol-gwang, can we interview you about your feelings at that time?"

"Hey, looking at your arm muscles, you seem to have worked out a bit. How much do you lift?"

"No, not that. Please answer the interview……."

Stella's 2nd-year S-class, Dok Cheol-gwang. After the competition, it was revealed that thanks to him holding off the dark mage for a while, there were almost no casualties, making him a hot topic alongside Baek Yuseol.

Dok Cheol-gwang, who was hospitalized in a single room, was swarmed by an enormous number of reporters. Although he seemed very annoyed, he let them in. Just before the interview, the S-class instructor had repeatedly told him, "Recognition is very important for a magic warrior!"

"Do you use any specific protein?"

Of course, his nonsensical answers were driving the reporters who came to interview him to the brink of a stroke. After the interview ended, Dok Cheol-gwang's partner, 2nd-year S-class Bandiyeon, came to visit.

"Hey, you look good?"

"Huff!"

Despite the nurse's instructions to rest for a while, Bandiyeon was dumbfounded to see Dok Cheol-gwang doing bodyweight exercises on the bare floor. She threw a protein bar and a ruler from her pocket, and he reflexively caught it without looking back, tore open the wrapper, and put it in his mouth.

"The hospital is too stuffy."

"Who told you to get hurt?"

"This will heal with exercise. I don't need surgery or medicine. Doctors suffer because their bodies are weak."

"……Nonsense."

Having somewhat loosened up, Dok Cheol-gwang cracked his shoulder muscles and swung his arms around. It seemed he was itching to move in such a small space. Bandiyeon watched him quietly. He was undoubtedly a fool with muscles filling his brain, and his behavior was often seen as ignorant by others, but…… If he could stand up to a dark mage without showing his back in a critical situation, wasn't he already a great magic warrior?

That's what she thought.

'What am I thinking…….'

Suddenly getting sentimental didn't suit her personality.

"By the way, is that kid outside your friend?"

"Hmm?"

"She's been hesitating in front of the hospital room for a while, wondering whether to come in or not."

At Bandiyeon's words, the sound of someone shuffling their feet in embarrassment became more pronounced. The sound of someone stomping their feet in hesitation could be heard even from here.

"Who? Another reporter? Annoying……"

Dok Cheol-gwang scratched the back of his head and peeked outside the hospital room. There was no one outside…… except for a small girl standing there, fidgeting.

"What are you doing here?"

"Y-yes? Yes? Uh, um……."

When Dok Cheol-gwang spoke to her, the girl, clearly flustered, shook her pupils greatly, then lowered her head and stammered.

"Um, from the survival…… Do you remember me?"

"No."

At Dok Cheol-gwang's thoughtless reply, the girl looked hurt but quickly closed her eyes and said.

"You saved me back then……."

"Oh. That was you."

Dok Cheol-gwang, who was nonchalantly picking his ear, didn't seem to think much of it, but it was clearly a big deal for the girl.

"I'm Ban Yurin……. Please, take this!"

With her face flushed red, she thrust a gift box with a pink envelope into Dok Cheol-gwang's chest and then ran away.

"What the heck?"

Dok Cheol-gwang couldn't understand the girl's actions at all, but Bandiyeon, who had been watching from behind, smacked his back.

"You idiot! Finally, spring has come for you too."

"It's already summer."

"You dense fool. How will you ever date?"

"My girlfriends are the barbell and protein. I have two."

"Ugh……."

Seeing Dok Cheol-gwang being even denser than expected, Bandiyeon was just dumbfounded.

"Live like that forever……."

Saying that, she suddenly felt a bit scared, thinking he might actually live like that forever.

The day Orenha regained consciousness was about a week after the incident occurred.

The Cradle of the Celestial Tree, Sariflower Hospital. It was a place filled with the energy of the World Tree, causing an addiction-like effect, so ordinary elves were prohibited from entering. Only high elves who could control the energy themselves were allowed.

"……What did you just say?"

Orenha, who had regained consciousness after a week, trembled at the doctor's words.

"What did you say……?"

"We have removed all the mana from your body. It was an unavoidable choice to save you, so please……."

"Who gave you the right! Who gave you the right to take my mana!!"

Orenha, who had jumped up from his seat, grabbed the doctor's collar. However, due to not moving for a week, his muscles cramped, and he lost strength. The doctor bowed his head with a regretful expression. There was nothing he could do for the patient, so he felt a surge of guilt.

"Was it you? I'll kill you……. How dare you take my mana……!"

Crash!

"Aaah!!"

A wizard who loses their mana often shows similar behavior. Some get angry and lash out, some despair and faint. If not, they might even choose the extreme option of committing suicide on the spot.

For a wizard, magic is life itself. Although Orenha had learned magic for the sake of Flowerseorin, it had already become a part of him. Like one's limbs or facial features. But upon waking up, he found them all cut off. All that was left was…… his thinking brain.

No matter how hard he tried to move his arms, walk, look ahead, smell, or taste, he couldn't do anything. A wizard who loses all their mana feels exactly like that.

"Who, who gave you the right……"

"I'm sorry, Orenha."

At that moment, a voice was heard. Looking towards the door of the hospital room…… Flowerseorin, dressed in a black dress, was standing there. Instantly, Orenha's mood soared. Flowerseorin herself had come to visit. The person who had been smashing everything in anger just moments ago disappeared, and he greeted her with a face full of ecstasy.

"Ah…. Your Majesty. Welcome."

Seeing him like that, Flowerseorin couldn't help but feel deeply sorry. It was already severe. Enchanted by the power of the Love-Absorbing Body, Orenha's anger at losing his mana was instantly suppressed by this false love. Indeed…… Is this the right treatment? If I don't return this feeling, he will eventually fall into lovesickness and die. But it was too late to worry now. Orenha had lost all his mana. He had fallen in love with me. ……But I can't return his mana or his love.

Flowerseorin closed her eyes tightly and forced herself to speak each word calmly.

"Orenha, my aide."

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"……I am truly sorry about your body."

"No, Your Majesty. How could this be your fault? Even in this state, I am confident I can serve you for the rest of my life!"

Seeing his confident demeanor, Flowerseorin's heart ached even more. But she had to say what needed to be said. That was the right thing to do.

"No. It's my fault."

"……What?"

Flowerseorin's atmosphere felt strange. Having always watched her closely, Orenha sensed something was off. And then, the shocking words came from her mouth.

"I was the one who ordered your mana to be removed."

"Ah."

What did I just hear? Orenha looked at her with a puzzled expression, unable to understand. Her sad expression deepened. At times like this, she was glad she wore a mask. Her ability to manage her expressions was on par with that of a child.

"Orenha……. As you know, I am under a terrible curse. Ordinary people who see my face die shortly after, and high-level wizards lose their sanity and go berserk."

"That, I know……."

"When you met me…… you had a mana outburst. I had no choice. I didn't want you to die."

"Ah……."

Orenha bit his lip. His face was filled with the loss of everything.

"Even so…… it's okay."

He struggled to lift his trembling head and met Flowerseorin's eyes.

"Even without this mana, I am confident I can serve you for the rest of my life."

He seemed to have made a firm decision, but unfortunately, it was impossible. That confident and self-assured demeanor would only last a moment. As soon as Flowerseorin disappeared, his inner hysteria would explode again. The despair and anger of a wizard who has lost their mana do not subside easily. Knowing this well, Flowerseorin could no longer keep him as her aide. She thought the best way to make him comfortable was to let him rest for the rest of his life.

"Orenha……"

"Wait, Your Majesty. I still…."

"Please…… retire."

Ah. The words he had hoped would never come out finally did, and Orenha's pupils lost focus.

"You can live in the best villa or mansion for the rest of your life, with many servants. If there's anything you want to do or have, just let me know. I'll grant any of your wishes."

Orenha remained silent, and Flowerseorin waited for him. She couldn't fathom his feelings as he tried to sort out his complicated thoughts and choose his words. After a long while, he finally spoke.

"……I don't need any of that."

"Money, fame, power, even magic doesn't matter!"

Orenha shouted at Flowerseorin with burning eyes.

"I just…… need you, Your Majesty! Please, don't abandon me……."

His desperate voice almost swayed her heart, but Flowerseorin, who had resolved not to waver, firmly shook her head. What he wanted was not just to stay by her side but to have her heart. But that was…… impossible. Orenha had been a friend for a long time, but he was just a friend. She couldn't return his feelings of love. Keeping him by her side would only cause him pain. The hope that he might one day receive her love would grow like a balloon and eventually burst.

"……I'm sorry. Orenha, I can't give you my heart."

So Flowerseorin drew a firm line.

Thud. Orenha's body lost all strength and collapsed to the floor. Flowerseorin, who had seen through his heart, had drawn the line, extinguishing his last hope. That was the end.

"Please…… rest now."

Flowerseorin couldn't bear to face Orenha's despairing expression any longer and hurriedly left the hospital.

"Haa……."

Having run all the way to the garden, Flowerseorin sat down, leaning against a tree to catch her breath. Sweat beaded on her forehead and cheeks, but she couldn't take off her mask for fear of being seen.

Rustle!

"Did it go well?"

At that moment, Baek Yuseol appeared, parting the bushes. Flowerseorin, startled, let out a sigh of relief.

"You scared me……."

He looked around and nodded.

"There's no one here, so you can take off your mask."

"……Yes. The fairies are telling me."

Being able to hear the voices of spirits and fairies, she had already known there was no one around. But still, taking off her mask was…… scary. Because of her careless actions, she had lost another connection this time. Baek Yuseol didn't say anything more. He knew she was feeling guilty about Orenha. But that wouldn't last long. Orenha, who had lost all his mana, would soon reveal his true nature and cause a riot in the hospital. Flowerseorin would be hurt by seeing his ugly and dirty side, but her guilt would fade. It wasn't a bad thing. Orenha was too dangerous to keep by Flowerseorin's side.

"Did it go well?"

"……More or less."

Flowerseorin fidgeted with the hem of her dress. It was Baek Yuseol who had advised her to draw a clear line with Orenha.

'Don't feel guilty. That guy…… I mean, he brought it on himself by exposing himself to the curse.'

Baek Yuseol didn't have the eloquence to charm everyone like Flame. He couldn't offer warm words of comfort or genuinely empathize. So he gave practical advice.

'It's his fault.'

Those were the words he used to try to ease Flowerseorin's guilt.

"I'm glad it went well."

"Yes……."

"It would be nice if this never happened again."

When Baek Yuseol said that, Flowerseorin looked up at him. He was a young boy who hadn't even lived half as long as she had, yet he seemed smarter, wiser, and more mature. In reality, he had achieved more than she had. He had overcome the same curse she had and was writing a new history at a school for the world's greatest geniuses, despite having the worst talent. She, who had been blessed as a high elf from birth and was evaluated as having the qualities of a great wizard, was hiding in a corner, unable to overcome a single curse.

That's how she felt. As if Baek Yuseol was far away and high above. So she wanted to ask him. How can I be like you? How can I one day take off my mask and proudly show myself to the world?
