# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy's Front Flash

## Chapter 252: Noble Soul (5)

Occasionally, Flame dreams. While this is an extremely common phenomenon for humans, it is not so for Flame. Uniquely, she was born with the characteristics of numerous races. Human, elf, dwarf, spirit, and even angelic traits. Although only five were recorded at Stella Academy, Flame herself had discovered and documented over twelve racial traits, with the potential for more to manifest in the future.

Elves can commune with nature, dwarves can manipulate materials, and each race has inherent traits. Flame, possessing all these traits, sometimes exhibits special abilities whose origins are unknown. For instance, 'prophetic dreams.'

- "It's not a prophetic dream, Flame. It's called a 'revelation.'"

She once asked the angels, but it wasn't one of their traits. Angels... don't dream.

"Ugh."

A throbbing headache, the feeling of endlessly falling into an abyss, a sense of wandering aimlessly in a vortex, dizziness, and a sense of emptiness as if dropped into a vast ocean. Familiar sensations. This special feeling, experienced perhaps once a year, or maybe once every three years, was undoubtedly a prophetic dream.

"…You must not find…."

"From the beginning…."

"…Become the nth star…."

"There is no predetermined fate…."

She realized it was a prophetic dream and a lucid dream. However, even knowing it was a lucid dream, Flame couldn't do anything. It felt like being crushed by a nightmare, unable to move.

"What? What are you saying? Speak clearly!"

She shouted into the void. The space was dyed golden. A massive, inverted castle floated in the sky, and at the end of a large, U-shaped bridge, clouds hung like rubber.

She wanted to wake up from the eerie sensation of dreams and reality mixing, but she knew she shouldn't. Prophetic dreams are special. Even in the original novel, prophetic abilities were extremely rare. While it was surprising to have such an ability, its existence wasn't strange.

"Who are you?"

The figure had a dark and blurry impression, as if shrouded in mist. He didn't answer her question, only repeating the same words.

"You will… rise as a star…."

"Please, stop. My head hurts every time I hear your voice. This isn't a prophetic dream. When I was young, my dreams were intuitive glimpses of significant moments in my life, like entering Stella Academy or awakening my magic. But this dream is just painful and not helpful at all."

"Please…."

As Flame tightly closed her eyes and covered her ears, the world suddenly turned white with a strange sensation of being sucked in somewhere.

"Ah…!"

Then, she saw clearly before her, boys and young men with golden hair and radiant white wings. They looked at Flame with worried eyes and reached out their hands.

- "Sorry, Flame. We can't bear to see you suffer."

They closed Flame's eyes again and said,

- "We wish you wouldn't dream, Flame."

- "But…."

- "It only causes you pain."

"Ah…."

The headache washed away like water. She felt at ease, as if sleeping in her mother's womb. And when she opened her eyes again, it was surprisingly an ordinary day, as if nothing had happened.

"Alright, who wants to solve the next problem?"

Stella Academy, classroom. She must have dozed off while catching up on assignments late into the night. And of all times, she had a nightmare… no, a prophetic dream.

"Hey… Flame, are you okay?"

A male student sitting next to her quietly asked. She noticed she was drenched in cold sweat.

"Uh… yeah. It's nothing."

Since entering Stella, she hadn't had a prophetic dream, but now of all times, she wondered if there was a reason. Well… prophetic dreams have no reason. They have no meaning. They only show what you don't want to know and never what you do.

She thought, 'I wonder if Baek Yuseol knows about prophetic dreams?' Perhaps another version of herself in another world had confided in Baek Yuseol about the prophetic dreams. He probably figured out the truth, given his personality. But… she didn't want to reintroduce memories left by another version of herself to him. He would find out in due time, so she decided not to ask now.

Ding-dong!

After the class ended, Flame packed her textbooks and walked down the hallway with a tired face.

"Hi, Flame!"

"Yeah."

"Hello! You look tired today?"

"Yeah…."

"Flame! Want to go to Café Bridge?"

"No…."

Friends greeted her as she walked down the hallway, but she was too tired to respond properly. Normally, Flame would respond half-heartedly, so her friends didn't notice anything unusual.

"Hi…."

"Yeah…."

Again, someone greeted her, and she responded half-heartedly, trying to pass by, but the person blocked her way, forcing her to stop.

"…What is it?"

Flame raised her head to see who it was and frowned. The boy with black hair tinged with red and a cold impression looked down at her with purple eyes.

"…Haewonryang. What do you want?"

"I have a favor to ask."

"A favor? If it's troublesome, pass."

"It's not troublesome. I think you'll find it quite interesting."

"What is it…?"

Lately, every day had been boring, so when Haewonryang said that, she became curious. He quickly handed her a small pamphlet as her eyes sparkled.

"This time, there's a League of Spirits tournament to select additional reserve players."

"Oh. Are you inviting me to watch?"

Haewonryang shook his head.

"Would you consider participating as a player?"

"What?"

Come to think of it, she had experienced a similar situation before. Then, she remembered something.

'Did I register for the tournament…?'

Flame enjoyed watching League of Spirits matches but had no intention of participating. However, she had been forcibly registered as a player by Jeremy Scalven. She had tried to cancel it but was told it was impossible as her name was already on the list. After several days of trying to find a manager, she kept hearing it was impossible. Now, they were holding an additional player selection tournament.

'Could it be that I'm really a player?'

Flame's face turned pale, and her mouth gaped open. Haewonryang's expression hardened.

"Are you not interested in being a player?"

"No, it's not that…."

What should she do? The thought of having to be a League of Spirits player made her dizzy.

"Jeremy, you bastard… I'll kill you someday…."

Her eyes turned fierce.

* * *

Early morning. The sky, tinged with a reddish hue, was particularly beautiful at the Third World Tree, Namuhwaran's orchard. I took a deep breath after arriving on the early morning train.

When I saw the elderly doing exercises or stretching on the mountain, claiming to absorb energy, I thought it was strange. But now, I understand. As a mana leakage patient, the mana I inhale is immediately expelled, but it's not entirely meaningless. The more I breathe pure mana, the higher my internal mana circulation rate, increasing my growth speed.

Of course… no matter how hard I breathe here, it won't make much difference. Unless I train hard in a place full of energy.

Namuhwaran's orchard was once the land of elves but has been open to humans for decades. The culture and scenery haven't changed much. The reason they maintain their traditions is that this place has become more significant as a tourist destination, introducing elven culture to outsiders and making money.

"…Should I wait a bit?"

After arriving at the station, I didn't move immediately but sat in a nearby waiting area and opened a book. The history of Aither World is a grand fantasy epic, and there's nothing more enjoyable than reading it. Since arriving in this world, my knowledge of magic hasn't increased much, but I've become well-versed in history. Maybe I could become a history teacher if I have nothing else to do later.

After reading for about 30 minutes, I heard the sound of the next train arriving. The train, fitting for the land of elves, was quiet but slow, as if it sacrificed speed for silence. And on that train was… the Elf King, Flower Serin.

Chiiik!

As the train doors opened, a few people disembarked. A gloomy mage in a robe, a confident dwarf with a small stature, an elf with ears wrapped in bandages, and a human worn out by daily life. It wasn't hard to spot Flower Serin among them. Wearing a black dress and a mask, she looked quite ordinary for a mage, but she stood out to me.

She also spotted me immediately and walked over with quick steps.

"It's been a while. I didn't expect to see you here…."

"Do you still wear a mask when you go out?"

"I still have the curse, so I have to be careful when I go out. And… it's hard to move freely as the Elf King."

Well, the curse is one thing, but Flower Serin, who longed for freedom, probably wore the mask to move freely without being recognized. Even after the curse is lifted, she might still enjoy wearing the mask. Once her face is revealed, everyone in the world will recognize her.

"Shall we go?"

Flower Serin said confidently, walking somewhere. She seemed to plan to enjoy her rare leisure time, even if it was less than two days. But… unfortunately, her plans were ruined in less than 30 minutes.

Thud! Thud!

Elven knights in green robes knelt before Flower Serin, who was hiding her identity with a black dress and white mask. Their robes bore the emblem of Namuhwaran, making the situation clear.

'We've been discovered.'

I had a rough idea. As the Elf King, Flower Serin was connected to the first World Tree, Cheonryeong Tree. She exuded a mysterious aura that only elves could sense. The dress could block the curse but not the aura of the Elf King. She tried to hide it, but it was impossible to fool the elders of the Third World Tree, Namuhwaran.

"Your Majesty, why did you visit our cradle without informing us?"

The leading elf, kneeling, asked Flower Serin in a heavy voice. He was probably the equivalent of a district mayor in human terms.

"I had a reason to visit quietly."

"I see. I apologize for not understanding your deep intentions. However, knowing that Your Majesty has visited, we couldn't ignore it and came to see you."

"In that case… it can't be helped."

Flower Serin looked apologetically at me, but I didn't mind. Whether it was the district mayor or anyone else, I just needed to visit Iphanell's Garden. Sometimes, such experiences are refreshing.

But something felt off.

'This is too formal for elves.'

The noble culture of humans and elves is quite different. While it might be natural for human vassals to use extreme honorifics with their king, elves don't need to grovel like this. The Elf King is just the greatest being who can communicate with the Cheonryeong Tree. Flower Serin, despite her lack of social experience, seemed unfamiliar with this treatment and looked deeply troubled.

"Your Majesty, may I speak?"

As expected, the elf elder spoke in a voice that suggested something was up.

"Go ahead."

When Flower Serin nodded, he raised his head and spoke.

"Namuhwaran's orchard… has started to be contaminated from the roots."

Wait, what? Namuhwaran is contaminated? Already?

'Things are progressing… very quickly.'

As far as I know, the contamination of Namuhwaran's orchard by black magic happens in the second half of the second year or the beginning of the third year. The timeline has advanced by one to two years. While there have been episodes that went awry, this is the first time something has been so drastically accelerated. I was as shocked as Flower Serin.

"Your Majesty, please protect our cradle…."

The elder bowed his head, and Flower Serin and I looked at each other in silence. I came to check on Iphanell's condition, but things have gotten more complicated than expected.
