### The End of Summer (2)

When Angel and Flame regained consciousness, they found themselves at a campsite located some distance away from the ruins of Karakornia.

"You were both found unconscious," said the leader of the Karakornia exploration team with a bitter expression. It had been a week since they started exploring the ruins, but they had found nothing and had not been able to locate the missing Kyla. The disappearance of Flame and Angel had caused great concern. "At least it's fortunate that we found you two," he added, giving the two girls some personal time to rest.

Left alone in a three-person tent, the two girls sat in silence, staring blankly in different directions. The surreal experience they had gone through left them struggling to regain a sense of reality. Flame was the first to break the silence.

"...What are we going to do?" she asked, her question seemingly out of context but already prepared for an answer. Angel parted her lips to speak.

"The Morfran Forest used to be the territory of the Morf Grand Duchy. But after that day, it was designated as 'contaminated land' and is now managed by a nation, five magic towers, and the Mage Association." The area around the Morfran Forest was heavily guarded, with security forces ensuring that not even an ant could approach.

Until now, they hadn't questioned it much, but something seemed off. "Why are they so determined to keep that place hidden?"

The legendary beast, the White Fox Hwa-ryeong. The black mage of 9 Risks, Isaac Morf. And even Baek Yuseol. The scars of that fierce battle were still etched into the Morfran Forest.

"That land is the evidence," Angel Morf said, now able to clearly define her goal. Reviving the Morf Grand Duchy. But first, she needed to uncover the truth about the events of ten years ago and retrieve her father's wandering soul. It wouldn't be easy. The Morfran Forest had become a place of shame for the Adolevit Kingdom, and they would never reveal it. Finding her father's soul, which could be anywhere, seemed impossible.

But it was okay. "Father was not a traitor." "He was a hero." "And he is still alive somewhere." Knowing this truth was a significant gain and a source of happiness for Angel. She stretched, feeling more refreshed than ever, as if a heavy burden had been lifted from her chest.

"Shall we head back now?" she asked.

"The exploration team seems determined to investigate Karakornia thoroughly. They will likely continue searching for the missing Kyla. But she is no longer here. Having shown Angel the echoes of the past, Kyla is probably traveling somewhere else by now. The chances of finding anything in the ruins are slim, but no one would listen to two seventeen-year-old girls."

"I'll go inform them that we're leaving," Angel said as she left the tent. Flame sighed deeply and collapsed onto the ground.

"Haah... It was a really tough journey. Who would have thought that just watching could be so mentally draining? I couldn't take my eyes off Angel for even a moment out of concern."

She recalled the moment just before they returned. Baek Yuseol had been about to send Isaac Morf on the mysterious object known as the Wheel of Dawn. He had muttered to himself, or rather, it was a conversation. "I haven't received the promised gift yet. Is it okay to receive it now?"

Promises and gifts. In the original romance fantasy, the word "promise" appeared frequently. The Twelve Constellations were bound by promises with someone, and they were determined to fulfill them. However, this plot point was never fully resolved. What exactly was that promise?

When Baek Yuseol spoke as if asking for something, a giant wheel appeared in the air shortly after. It meant that someone was watching him, even if they were invisible. But Flame already knew who that "someone" was.

"The Constellation Project." "I will send back the Wheel of Dawn." Baek Yuseol had said it himself. He could communicate with and access the "Library of Stars," which contained all the knowledge of the world. This was one of the many secrets Baek Yuseol had kept hidden. It was somewhat expected. The Constellation Project wouldn't just stand by while Baek Yuseol fought against the world's destruction by turning back time thousands of times.

Her heart pounded. The Library of Stars, a legendary place, was something even the girls with the power of the Twelve Families could barely approach. Yet Baek Yuseol could communicate with it. The more she learned about Baek Yuseol, the more questions arose. But it was enjoyable. Little by little, she was getting to know more about him.

"...Shall we go back?" Flame thought it would be best to hurry, as Angel was probably eager to return to Stella by now.

### Adolevit Kingdom, Capital Tehalan

Frostcliff Palace. With the curse of the Levian Sea lifted thanks to Princess Hong Biyeon, the warm light pouring onto this cliff made one question whether the name "Frost" was still appropriate. However, the cold atmosphere inside the palace still suited the name.

Queen Hong Seryu of Adolevit brushed her red hair back over her shoulder and spoke to Princess Hong Biyeon, who stood proudly before her.

"It's the start of the semester at Stella."

"Yes."

"Will you return? If you wish, you can stay here and receive the princess education you have missed."

"No, it's fine." Receiving the education she missed as a princess was important, but she could study it at Stella in her spare time.

"It seems you have a reason to return to Stella."

She had no intention of quitting Stella. She planned to fill the three years and graduate normally.

"It will be disadvantageous for you. The coronation is scheduled for three years from now, and you won't be able to receive proper royal education while completing your studies at Stella."

"It has always been disadvantageous. Please stop pretending to care now."

"...I understand. Since you brought this upon yourself, do not blame me for it."

"Yes."

"Go back."

The conversation between the queen and the princess ended abruptly and dryly. Hong Biyeon turned to leave without hesitation but paused for a moment.

"Is there something you want to ask?"

"...I have a question."

"Speak."

Recently, Hong Biyeon had learned about a "curse" that had been passed down through the Adolevit family. No matter how untalented a princess was, she would not live past thirty years, and those who inherited the Adolevit flame would die in their late teens or early twenties.

But something seemed off. Princess Hong Siwha, though lacking compared to herself, also had innate talent. "How has she managed to maintain her lifespan?"

A princess nearing the end of her life would lose control of her flame and die in agony. But when had Hong Siwha ever shown such symptoms? She always seemed relaxed and controlled her flame magic freely, never showing signs of losing control. It was as if she had overcome the Adolevit curse.

"That is not the case," Queen Hong Seryu said firmly. "But I can tell you that she is extending her life through a method you do not know."

"...Is that so?"

"Is that all you wanted to know?"

"Yes."

It seemed there was a method, but the queen had no intention of revealing it. Hong Biyeon wasn't particularly interested in learning the repulsive method Hong Siwha had discovered. Why bother finding another way when becoming queen would suffice?

As Hong Biyeon turned to leave without hesitation, Hong Seryu added, "Do not be curious."

"Knowing it will only poison you."

She had no intention of being curious, and even if she found out, she had no intention of using Hong Siwha's method to extend her life. It was a needless worry.

Leaving the audience chamber, Hong Biyeon walked down the long corridor, receiving salutes from the royal guards. She intended to be alone with her thoughts, but someone leaning against the door ahead caught her attention.

"Hello?"

An annoying face that appeared whenever she was about to forget it.

"Do you have any business?"

"Yes! I heard you're going back to Stella, so I thought I'd see my sister before you leave!"

"You've seen me, so you can go now."

"You're so cold!"

Ignoring Hong Siwha's fake crying, Hong Biyeon tried to pass by, but Hong Siwha suddenly spoke.

"Are you curious?"

"...About what?"

"How I'm still living healthily."

"You have a habit of eavesdropping."

"It just happened that way. I also had business with the queen."

Hong Siwha had a habit of deflecting unfavorable topics and redirecting the conversation to her opponent.

"So, are you curious? Do you want to know?"

"...I don't need to know."

"If you lose the throne, you'll die!"

"I'd rather die than live a miserable life using your repulsive method."

As Hong Biyeon tried to pass by, Hong Siwha lowered her voice.

"Sister."

"...What?"

"Do you want to see this?"

Hong Siwha suddenly lifted her top, revealing her navel. The stares from the guards were piercing. How could a princess of a nation have no sense of shame?

...But before that, Hong Biyeon was surprised and widened her eyes.

"That is..."

"You're right. I'm living a miserable life using a repulsive method."

A white magic circle was engraved on Hong Siwha's abdomen, burning like a flame. No, it was actually burning. The temperature around them had risen sharply since she lifted her top. The heat was so intense that sweat was pouring down just from standing nearby.

"...Do you always carry such a flame inside you?"

"Yes. It's a bit hot and painful, but it's bearable. It's better than dying, right?"

This was undoubtedly Hong Siwha's weakness. She had never revealed it to anyone before. But why now? Why show it to me?

"Did you know? If you become queen, the curse will be temporarily suppressed, and you'll live much longer."

"I know."

"But what about your children?"

"...What?"

Hong Biyeon hadn't considered that at all. She could only move her lips without answering.

"What if you fall in love? What if you want to have children, but the curse is passed on to them? What if they can't inherit the throne and eventually die? Would you still have children?"

"That... is..."

Her fingertips trembled. She had always been a child, never considering the "mother's perspective." Come to think of it, her mother, Hong Iel, had been particularly harsh on her. But could she call it "harsh" when her mother did everything to make her daughter a queen and save her life?

"Maybe it was love for her child."

Watching the confused Hong Biyeon, Hong Siwha hummed and lowered her top. She walked towards the audience chamber, leaving one last remark.

"Think about it. You don't want to live a miserable life like me, right?"

She was right. Hong Biyeon had no intention of living like Hong Siwha. That's why she aimed to live a full life through the "right method" of inheriting the throne.

"...Oh."

If the method she believed to be right, her lifelong goal, was actually flawed. If it was wrong, then what should she do?

"I don't know."

Her mind was filled with confusion.
