# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy's Front Flash
## Chapter 248: Noble Soul (1)

The wizards had long since developed a preference for high places. Not in a metaphorical or symbolic sense, but quite literally, they enjoyed being in elevated locations. This was true for everyone, but especially for humans and elves, who, the higher their status, the more they used the upper floors of buildings. Wizards, however, had an even stronger obsession with high places than these individuals.

Historically, the higher the floor one used in a magic tower, the higher their rank. The noble archmages were not satisfied with mere high floors and extended their domain into the sky.

The "Pillar of Rasselon," also known as the light green magic tower, was quite unique in that it had only seven affiliated wizards. However, all seven were 8th-class wizards, and the tower master was "Toa Legron," one of the 9th-class wizards, making it highly renowned despite its small size.

Due to various reasons such as insufficient minimum personnel, annual research shortfalls, minimal magical contributions, violations of magical laws, and leaving the magical community, it was not officially registered as a magic tower. However, the word "official" seemed meaningless to them.

"Unlike before, it's a boring place."

Eltman Eltwin, the principal of Stella Academy and a 9th-class spatial wizard, leisurely crossed his legs and admired the view of the light green tower. This magic tower could be described as a tower that floated in the air and moved freely. Currently, its floating height was less than 10 meters, but that was not the point of amusement. The tower master, Toa Legron, simply did not want the tower to float higher. If he wished, it was the only magic tower capable of circumnavigating the world.

"It can't be helped. I'm old now."

"Time spares no one."

Both Toa Legron and Eltman Eltwin, who spoke thus, had the appearance of teenage boys, causing the attendant serving tea to break out in a cold sweat. Fortunately, knowing that these individuals were among the world's greatest sages, numbering less than ten, he refrained from making any remarks.

"It's been almost half a year since we last met."

"Half a year? More like half a century."

"Has it been that long already?"

Toa Legron, a boy with dark brown hair and yellow eyes resembling the desert. When Eltman had seen him as a child, he had the appearance of someone in their twenties. Meeting each other in the form of boys for the first time was quite awkward and uncomfortable.

As Eltman lowered his gaze and swirled his teacup, Toa Legron spoke.

"There was some commotion in Arcanium."

"Indeed."

"I heard a witch almost turned the entire city upside down..."

Toa Legron narrowed his eyes and spoke to Eltman in a low voice, as if threatening.

"What were you doing all this time?"

Eltman, still without a change in expression, swirled his teacup and then spoke.

"I was busy."

"Lies. Do you think I don't know you were just watching? You've always been like that."

Eltman laughed at his words.

"Did you ask knowing well? Yes, I no longer interfere in worldly matters."

"Speak clearly."

"You're so picky. Fine, not just worldly matters... I don't interfere in any events or stories happening in the world. I plan to continue that way. Well, I can't tolerate bugs crawling into my precious nest, though."

"Is that so?"

Toa Legron tapped the table with his fingers and spoke nonchalantly.

"With that personality, you manage to endure in that rotten bug nest."

It was a pointed remark, but responding playfully seemed meaningless. If the other party disliked jokes, he would have responded with a joke, but this old man was too cunning for such tricks to work.

However, before Eltwin could respond, Toa Legron continued.

"But even in such a bug nest... sometimes, there's a useful stag beetle."

It wasn't difficult to understand his meaning immediately. As Eltman's expression gradually darkened, Toa Legron spoke.

"Eltman, it's time for you to do something useful. My master wants the child who hunted the witch."

At the mention of an unexpected person, Eltman was slightly surprised and widened his eyes. However, he calmly replied without panicking.

"That old hag is still alive?"

"Wouldn't it be stranger if she were dead? She clings to life more tenaciously than anyone else. And don't call her an old hag. She has a different perspective on age than humans."

Eltman, frowning, spoke sharply.

"...Taking that child, even for an old hag, would be difficult."

"Your difficulty is not my concern. But you know, my master... always gets what she wants."

"Well, even if it's your master, this time it seems impossible."

"I didn't expect you to care so much for that child. It's unfortunate, but it can't be helped. This is partly your fault. After all, the child hunted a witch... it would be stranger if they didn't stand out."

The name Baek Yuseol was widely known in the magical community, but his fame had its limits. He was only seventeen, and no matter how outstanding his achievements, he had only hunted 6th to 7th-risk black mages. From the perspective of archmages who had lived for centuries, it was merely an interesting story of a frog killing a toad, nothing more, nothing less.

However, a witch was different. A witch was a highly threatening existence even to archmages. Ordinary people might think he had hunted a slightly more formidable black mage, but the more experienced the wizard, the more deeply they would consider the significance of witch hunting.

Historically, successful witch hunts were extremely rare, so the name Baek Yuseol would have reached the ears of reclusive sages. Thus, even the "damned old hag" who had completely severed ties with the world would have heard of Baek Yuseol.

'This is... genuinely annoying.'

Eltman frowned deeply, but that woman, full of greed, would surely try to get what she wanted.

'Resist?'

No. That would be dangerous. The socially inept old hag might even half-destroy Stella Academy. With his current magic, he could certainly stop her, and perhaps even win, but the process would leave Stella Academy in ruins, which wouldn't be worth it.

Thus, only one method remained.

'Leave it to Baek Yuseol's soul.'

When Arein entered the hospital room, I closed the door and set the pad to indicate "in a meeting." The doctor would come soon, but the conversation with Arein was more important.

"Please, have a seat."

There was no chair.

"...On the bed."

It wasn't very dignified, but there was no choice. I plopped down on the bed, but Arein stood by the window, looking out. Then, he suddenly spoke.

"You did well. You performed the mission even better than I expected."

"...Well, it was something worth doing."

Honestly, if it weren't for Flame's dramatic help at the end, things would have gone terribly wrong, but sometimes a man has to put on a brave front. When I shrugged and spoke nonchalantly, Arein nodded.

"Honestly, I didn't expect you to do this well. My expectations for you were very low."

"Oh... is that so."

"So, I must apologize. Do you remember the members of the Stella Knights I assigned to you?"

"Sort of?"

Those useless, stubborn fools.

"They were specially selected. Due to contractual reasons with Stella, we had to accept knights from noble families, but no matter how much I trained them, they were useless, so I assigned them to you."

Saying so, Arein handed me a magazine.

[Weekly Magic Parade]

A famous magazine. It was said that the wizard chosen as the monthly model was the trend of the month, and it had quite an influence.

"Huh?"

Apparently, this week's issue had already come out. The cover had the word "witch" written in large letters.

[Stella Knights on a Witch Hunt!]

I didn't need to read further to know. The Stella Knights were currently... being heavily criticized.

"Uh, well, I'm sorry..."

"No need to apologize. It's actually a good thing. They must be quite shocked by now. They're so embarrassed they can't even lift their heads."

If he put it that way.

"Rather, despite me assigning such fools to you, you not only successfully completed the mission... but also hunted a witch."

The moment the word "witch" left Arein's lips, a chill suddenly filled the hospital room. He probably didn't intend it, but his magic began to unconsciously emanate.

"...What was the witch's name?"

"Melisher... it was."

"I see."

He turned to look at me, briefly making eye contact, then unwrapped the bandages he always wore around his wrist and extended it to me. There, a black, shimmering... floral tattoo was engraved.

Even without my glasses, I could tell immediately. It was a witch's curse. Seeing my surprised expression, Arein spoke in a bitter voice.

"A long time ago, I faced a witch and was defeated, suffering great injuries. Considering the price I paid for challenging a witch as a wizard, I think I got off lightly."

"...I see."

"I probably won't live long. After realizing that death was imminent, I began to notice the things right in front of me."

Thinking of death, he must have suddenly realized. The only thing left by his side... was the Stella Knights.

He had no chivalric spirit. He acted roughly, performed missions ruthlessly, and committed crimes without hesitation, far from being honorable. But just because he lacked chivalric spirit didn't mean he wasn't sincere about the Stella Knights.

He was sincere about the Stella Knights, and because he wanted to change many things before he died... he was making numerous attempts, even if it meant overexerting himself. One of those attempts might be me. Granting a seventeen-year-old boy temporary knighthood was entirely unlike Arein.

"I... hope that even after my death, the Stella Knights will continue to be as renowned, or even more so, than they are now."

"I didn't expect you to have such deep attachment to the knights."

"It's not deep attachment. The Stella Knights are, currently, everything I have."

The only thing he had. Even if he didn't want to be attached, he couldn't help but be naturally attached.

"I am... looking for a suitable successor to protect the knights after me."

At this timing, anyone could guess who he meant without him saying it. I had enough sense to understand.

'Stella Knights Commander, huh...'

It's not a bad position, rather, it's an incredibly good one. Who would refuse the position of commander of the world's most renowned knights? I felt the same, but there was one thing that bothered me.

That was...

'He doesn't have to die.'

Currently, a witch's curse is an incurable disease. The reason wizards can't defeat witches is secondary; they can't even find them, and even if they kill them, there's no way to lift the curse.

However, during the time I played Aither World Online, a small group of female gamers who were obsessed with the character Arein didn't sit idly by. They prepared dozens of computers with astronomical funds, created numerous characters, and engaged in the insane act of endlessly designing storylines, including alchemy and magitech.

This madness, which even made headlines, eventually bore fruit. They found a way to lift Arein's curse. And that record was shared on an internet community and is fully preserved in my glasses.

'Do I want the position of commander?'

Yes, of course, I do. Just sitting in that position would allow me to live a life of luxury. 'But at the cost of Arein's life?' That was unacceptable, not just as a matter of conscience, but as a human being. Moreover, if I could make Arein an ally, he would be an incredibly reliable force. If there's a way to save him, it's right to do everything possible to save him.

Thinking so, I said.

"I will not do it."

I politely declined his offer. It might be disappointing for now, but I didn't explain the reason. I just hoped he would understand that it was all for his sake.
