# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy's Front Flash

## Chapter 214: Old Story (10)

Today was a truly strange day for Eizel. After finishing lunch as usual, she tried to sneak a piece of cake without the maid Pesila noticing, but unfortunately, she got caught because of the big cleaning day. Then, while secretly reading a comic book in her secret spot, a cat suddenly appeared, causing her to scream and get caught again. To make matters worse, she felt like playing with a ball today, but when she went to retrieve it after it flew over the wall, she got entangled in a special magic barrier and forgot the way back.

While wandering through the forest, she encountered a terrifying wolf monster. She really thought she was going to die. How many more times would a seven-year-old child feel the emotions of fear and despair under the threat of death? Her lips turned blue, her whole body trembled, and her heart pounded madly, but now she could at least put her mind at ease a little.

A masked stranger. She didn't know his name or face, but for some reason, being with him made her feel reassured.

"…So, are we going the right way now?" asked Baek Yuseol, who was following behind. Eizel, who was confidently leading the way, nodded hastily.

"Y-Yes, this way is correct."

"The 'this way' you mentioned earlier was northeast, but now you're saying 'this way' is northwest. The directions are different."

"T-That can't be!" Eizel's eyes spun in confusion. She was sure she came this way, so why were the directions different?

"Sigh… Future Eizel is smart and good at everything, but it seems she was a fool in her childhood. Well, being too smart at seven might be a bit scary too."

While Baek Yuseol was pondering what to do in this situation, a message was transmitted from his glasses.

[Analysis complete]
[The forest is enchanted with the 'Wanderer's Rule' magic, which impairs the sense of direction of living creatures.]

"What?" He couldn't help but widen his eyes in astonishment. Even though he had some knowledge from his glasses and had studied magic to some extent, he knew how absurd that statement was.

"Are you saying the entire forest is enchanted with magic…? That's insane."

Then a thought struck him. 'Wait… Direction-impairing magic? If it's magic, it can be analyzed, right?'

After waiting for a moment, it seemed as if the forest split open, revealing a clear path before his eyes.

"Oh… something…"

"…Is this a navigation system?"

It felt like the atmosphere was completely ruined. Anyway, finding the way was no longer a problem.

"Hey, follow me."

"Huh…?" Eizel, who had been following behind, looked at him in confusion as Baek Yuseol suddenly took the lead.

"Wait a minute! My dad said that outsiders would get lost in this forest."

"You got lost too. Speak properly."

"T-That's because… I forgot the method my dad taught me…."

Well, at that age, it's common to ignore what your dad says. She probably didn't pay attention and forgot the method.

"It's really dangerous…."

Despite Eizel's anxiousness, Baek Yuseol walked briskly. He dealt with any dangerous beasts or monsters that appeared with a single strike, causing Eizel's eyes to widen each time.

"Wow… It feels like I'm showing off my game ID to my cousin."

Although he felt proud, he also realized that this power wasn't truly his, which made him feel a bit despondent.

'…When I return to the present, I need to train without eating.'

How long had they wandered through the forest? When Baek Yuseol, who was leading, stopped, Eizel looked at him questioningly.

"Is there a problem?"

"Your friends seem to be here."

"Huh?"

Soon, the bushes parted, revealing a group of magic knights in blue uniforms.

'The emblem of the Morp Grand Duchy.'

Recognizing their identity at once, Baek Yuseol smiled.

"…Identify yourself."

The man who seemed to be the highest-ranking among the knights approached, pointing his staff at Baek Yuseol. Baek Yuseol lowered his staff and pointed at Eizel with his thumb.

"She said she was lost, so I was escorting her home."

When the knight looked at Eizel as if asking if it was true, she nodded hastily.

"Yes, it's true. He even defeated all the monsters!"

"I see. Miss, please come this way."

At the knight's words, Eizel ran over. However, just because she testified didn't mean the interrogation was over.

"Then, I'll ask again. Identify yourself."

"Baek Seolgi."

"…That's a rice cake name."

"That's why I hate rice cakes."

The knight frowned and was about to question further, but Eizel tugged at his sleeve and stopped him.

"Don't! He's really the one who helped me!"

"But, miss. This is… the 'Morp Forest,' which only the blood relatives of the Morp Grand Duchy can enter. Outsiders can never enter by ordinary means. So, we need to find out how he got here…."

"I'll tell my dad!"

"Ugh."

The ultimate move. The 'I'll tell my dad' of the grand duchy's eldest daughter was at least an SSS-rank skill, something no mere knight could withstand.

'So, this is that kind of place.'

He should have realized when Eizel called it the 'front yard.' It was a restricted area for outsiders. It seemed like getting a meal here was out of the question. Still, he had prevented young Eizel from dying a tragic death in the past, so he felt he had done his part.

"I took a wrong turn. If you could show me the way out, I'll leave quickly."

Baek Yuseol thought it would be better for both him and the knights if he disappeared, but…

"Wait a moment."

A deep voice echoed through the forest. The entire magic knight squad immediately turned around and knelt on one knee towards someone.

'…Crazy.'

Baek Yuseol broke into a cold sweat as he looked at the man who had come to the forest. Blue eyes identical to Eizel's, but with brown hair that was completely different. The very person the protagonist of this world always trusted and relied on in her memories.

'Isaac Morp.'

The legendary figure appeared before him at this moment.

"You saved my daughter in the forest?"

His tone was light, but to the listeners, it was anything but. Even his voice carried an overwhelming presence imbued with mana. Although history recorded him as only an 8th-class mage, if he had lived a little longer, he might have reached the 9th class, given his immense mana pressure.

'He's a terrifying man… His mana presence is so unique that I didn't even notice him approaching. Or rather, I felt his mana from far away but didn't realize it was Isaac Morp's.'

'Fighting him would be disastrous.'

Isaac glanced at Baek Yuseol, then smiled warmly and opened his arms towards his daughter.

"Our daughter got lost in the forest?"

"Daddy!"

Eizel ran into his arms. At this point, Baek Yuseol felt uneasy. His instincts warned him to leave this place as soon as possible.

"Seeing the reunion of father and daughter is rewarding. I'll be on my way now."

"Hmm? Haha, no. You saved my daughter, so I can't just let you go. It's almost dinner time, so let me treat you to a meal."

"…I'm not very hungry."

"Is that so? Then at least join us for the meal. If I let you go like this, I'll regret it for the rest of my life."

This was unmistakable. He had no intention of letting him go. If he refused… he would probably be dragged along forcibly. It was better to comply while he was still showing goodwill.

"Alright. I'll join you for the meal."

"Good! I'll have them prepare the princess's favorite Havrimyu potato salad!"

"Yay~!"

Eizel's childish behavior made Isaac, who seemed like an ordinary father, appear far from the grand duke. Why did every moment feel so surreal? And another thing. Why had he traveled back ten years and met these people?

'The Morp Grand Duke ten years ago…'

Even Baek Yuseol, who wasn't interested in the story, knew about the major event. The Morp Grand Duke's descent into dark magic. And betrayal. It seemed he had been caught up in the time when that event occurred.

* * *

The dinner was quite modest, not befitting a grand duke. In fact, it was certainly more impressive than other nobles, but it was much smaller in scale compared to the Adolevit royal family's meal he had seen before. After all, a meal between a father and daughter didn't need to be grand every day. They usually had simple meals in their private office, so today might be a special feast.

"Yum."

"Our princess, you're getting food all over your face again."

"Don't call me princess!"

Eizel seemed embarrassed by the word 'princess' and glanced at Baek Yuseol every time she heard it.

"You used to like it…."

Isaac made a hurt expression, then smiled again and wiped the Havrimyu sauce off Eizel's cheek. He said it was a sauce made from Havrimyu mushrooms, similar to truffle mushrooms on Earth. The aroma was so strong that it was maddening to just watch them eat. But he couldn't take off his mask for the feast.

"Aren't you really going to eat?"

"No. I have my reasons."

"Hmm, what kind of reasons make you not eat? Is it because you can't take off your mask?"

"Yes, that's correct."

Even a child could understand the obvious situation. He didn't lie.

"Then, fine. I won't force you to take off your mask. I have no intention of threatening my daughter's savior. But… I'm still curious about you. Could you tell me as much as you can?"

The Morp Forest was said to be thoroughly sealed with a special magic barrier to prevent anyone from entering. It wasn't because some great treasure was hidden inside, but because a ferocious beast was sleeping there. It had been quiet for over a hundred years since it was sealed, and the guards had become lax, so no one noticed when Eizel entered the forest. Since it was an intrusion from within the mansion, it was even more understandable. Of course, the guards would probably lose their jobs because of Eizel's accident.

"Um… My story, you say."

"Yes."

What should he say? He couldn't say he was from the future, and it felt awkward to say he was still a student.

"I'm just a wandering adventurer."

The most common, easiest to disguise, and hardest to identify profession. An adventurer. In other words, a vagrant. Or a bum. Or a homeless person.

"An adventurer. A romantic profession."

"Thank you."

"I heard from my daughter that you cut down a Sharp Wolf with a single strike."

"Yes."

"A sword… I've seen many mercenaries who use swords, but I've never seen anyone who could hunt a Sharp Wolf with a single strike."

Of course. It's common sense. Even with a good magic sword, it would take a team of 2 to 3 risk-level mercenaries to hunt a Sharp Wolf.

"That's right."

"But the beast you hunted was a 5-risk level threat. Even veteran magic warriors have to be extremely cautious to hunt it."

Ah, I see what he's getting at.

"Moreover… there's something strange about you. Ordinary mages release a small amount of mana from their bodies. I have a special ability to sense that."

I didn't know that. There were hardly any records about Isaac Morp in my glasses, so I didn't know.

"But I can't feel any mana from you. It's as if… you're detached from the world. Even the mysterious aura surrounding you, I can't identify it."

Isaac Morp had already put down his fork and knife and was staring at me with his hands clasped under his chin.

"Who are you, really?"

What should I say? I could only give the same answer.

"As I said, I'm an adventurer."

"I see. I'll take your word for it."

He seemed to organize his thoughts and nodded, then smiled gently at Eizel.

"Princess, are you done eating?"

"Yes. I want to go to my room."

"Call the maid Pesila."

Eizel glanced at me and left the dining room with the maid Pesila. She kept looking back at me as if something was bothering her.

"Now that my daughter is gone… I have a straightforward request."

A request from Isaac Morp. I sensed the gravity of the situation and nodded with a serious expression.

"First, I need to say this."

After a brief silence, he spoke.

"I won't live long."

"…What?"

The sudden statement left me speechless.

"No, what do you mean…"

"I can't tell you the reason. But this request is sincere. I won't be able to protect my daughter for long. If she stays with me, I might even harm her. When that time comes…."

Isaac Morp looked me straight in the eye and said,

"Can you protect my daughter, even for a short while? Until she can stand on her own… No, even if she just stays alive…."

His request was sudden, absurd, and unexpected, but I listened quietly without any reaction.

"Do you know why I'm asking a complete stranger whose identity I don't even know?"

I thought for a moment but didn't know.

"…Because I'm that desperate."

It seemed Isaac Morp already knew his fate. So, he was trying to prepare for it. I couldn't bear to look into his sad eyes, so I lowered my head.

"I can understand a person's nature through conversation. You're eccentric and unpredictable, but not evil. Rather… you could be considered righteous."

Isaac sighed and stood up, looking at the wall. There hung a family photo of him, his late wife, and his only daughter.

"So, I'm asking you. If you refuse, I can't do anything about it…."

"I'll do it."

I tried to avoid getting involved with future connections. But…

Was it really a coincidence that I ended up in this time period and met Eizel and Isaac Morp? Or was it fate?

I don't believe in coincidences or fate. But if I had the courage to refuse in this situation, I would be a heartless person.

"…Thank you. Truly."

Isaac nodded briefly and stared blankly at the picture. He muttered something in a small voice, as if casting a spell.

"I can't help it. I can't help it. But… even for the greater good, I can't sacrifice my daughter…."

He wasn't talking to me. He was talking to himself. Isaac Morp was hypnotizing himself. What was he so afraid of that even someone like Isaac Morp was trembling and self-hypnotizing?

If I didn't know anything, it would be one thing, but knowing a bit about him made my heart ache. There was probably nothing I could do.
