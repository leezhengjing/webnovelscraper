### Chapter 49: The Witch (4)

Two weeks have passed since the start of the new semester. During this time, I have been following a rather ordinary yet intense schedule. I attended classes regularly, wrote club activity reports with Mayuseong and Eijel every few days, and continued my training alone in the dormitory after school.

The dungeon embedded in the 500-year-old witch's crystal ball, designed for physical training, saw a significant increase in my clearing speed, leading to rapid progress. My stats increased steadily, and it wasn't just about growth; my understanding of the 'Taeryeong Divine Art' and 'Mana Leakage Delay' also improved. The meticulous control of teleportation in extreme situations led to a sharp rise in overall skill proficiency.

This might be the most peaceful period for now. Although the main episodes haven't started yet, events are gradually unfolding somewhere without my knowledge. During this time, I just need to continue my training quietly. That would have been enough.

However, a problem arose.

– Come to me...

A hallucination. Ever since I used the witch's crystal ball, I started hearing a woman's voice in my ears. The witch's item was something I had only encountered as a growth item in the game, so I had no idea about its side effects.

* 'I thought it was a ridiculously overpowered growth item with no penalties.'

When the witch's crystal ball was at level 498, its performance was significantly lower, and there were no such side effects. However, perhaps because I had absorbed too much dark mana from the witch hunter last time, the dense witch's scent embedded in the crystal ball seemed to have permeated me.

– Come to me...

"Shut up, it's driving me crazy."

Even while working out alone in the physical training room after using the crystal ball, the woman's voice kept lingering in my ears. It was more annoying than scary. I had somewhat adapted to it, considering it as white noise, but it was still noisy.

I searched for information on the side effects of using the witch's item with my binoculars, but there were no records of such hallucinations occurring to gamers controlling playable characters. Perhaps it was because I had overused the irregular item known as the 500-year-old witch's crystal ball.

In the end, I had no choice but to visit the library to solve this issue. Unfortunately, records about witches were almost nonexistent in modern times. It was common for people who had encountered witches to experience hallucinations, and in severe cases, it could lead to delusions, mental disorders, and split personalities.

Thinking about it, something seemed off. I was protected by the blessing of 'Yeonhongchun Samwol,' which granted complete immunity to mental magic. I had even broken through the illusion magic of Macaron Heijin, who inherited the witch's bloodline. So, what exactly was this hallucination?

'Is it not mental magic?'

It had been three days since I started visiting the library to solve the hallucination problem. I spent all day flipping through books about witches, but I couldn't find any answers. It would be great if I could encounter that witch hunter again. Although he was like a pushover to me last time, he was one of the most dangerous and intelligent wizards in the Aether World and an expert in the field of witches.

However, unless he came to find me, it would be nearly impossible for me to locate the witch hunter who could move freely through space.

"Sigh. I don't know."

I sighed deeply and put the book titled "The History of Witches and the Origins of Witch Hunts" back on the shelf. As I was about to leave the library, the librarian approached me.

"Aren't you borrowing any books today?"

"Pardon?"

"I noticed you've been borrowing books related to witches for the past few days, so I thought you might be interested. I prepared a few more for you."

"Really?"

Indeed, it would be more efficient to gather information from a librarian who could search for the location of all the books rather than wandering around myself.

"Then, please show me a few."

"Here you go."

Thud! The librarian smiled brightly and placed a few thick books on the table. They looked so heavy that I wondered how he managed to carry them, but he spoke with a nonchalant expression.

"I've recently become interested in witches too. There's a trend called 'Witch Restaurant,' you know? But you're the only student who has been looking for old documents about witches for the past few days."

"Oh... Well, the field of witches is indeed interesting, but it's also quite tedious once you start investigating it."

I selected a few books from the ones the librarian handed me and applied for a loan.

"Enjoy your reading. I found the legends and folklore about witches quite fascinating."

"Well... I'm not really interested in that."

"Be careful, they're heavy."

The librarian handed me the books, but they weren't that heavy for me. While they were indeed heavy for an ordinary person to carry around, it wasn't a big deal for me, who had surpassed the limits of an ordinary body.

The principles of the 'Taeryeong Divine Art' allowed me to absorb mana from nature and release explosive power in daily life.

"Baek Yuseol."

"...?"

As I was about to return to the dormitory to read the witch's documents as soon as possible, someone called out to me as soon as I left the library. The man, who exuded an aura of 'I'm serious,' had such a dense concentration of mana that no ordinary student would dare approach him. It was proof that he was a high-level wizard.

"Hello?"

It was easy to identify his affiliation. He was wearing the uniform of the Stella Knights. But why would a Stella Knight be looking for me?

"Captain Arain is calling for you. Will you go now? If you're not available, you can postpone it until tomorrow."

What is this? Something serious seems to have happened. Captain Arain, who commands the Stella forces, is one of the most powerful and influential figures in the current world. I can't think of any reason why such a person would call me personally.

Moreover, was Arain originally such a considerate person? In the original game, I remember him being endlessly cold and rude.

"Can I ask why?"

"I don't know the details, but if you ask, he told me to say it's related to 'witches.' Are you interested?"

"...Hmm. I'm interested."

Very much so. Anyone could find out that I've been investigating witches recently, but for Captain Arain to personally find out and call me...

"Alright. Let's go right now."

I didn't know what it was about, but there was no harm in meeting a big shot like Arain, so I readily agreed.

The streets of Arcanium, bathed in the evening glow, were filled with a warm atmosphere as they were dyed in a deep crimson hue. In contrast, the streets were always bustling with students leaving school, but Kaen, the leader of the Myeoramdan, didn't particularly like this noisy commotion.

Originally, he was planning to return to the Sakwol Tower. Kaen and Heijin had captured and executed a dark mage hiding in a large magic tower, and Heijin, who was whining about going on a belated summer vacation, was planning to return immediately to report.

However, the plan was significantly disrupted.

'A dark blue shadow has fallen over the magic city of Arcanium.'

It was a direct order from the Sakwol Tower Lord, Rudrick. It had been a long time since an order had been issued without going through psychometry, so they couldn't refuse, and Heijin silently followed the order.

One of the reasons she silently followed was probably because of the phrase 'dark blue shadow.'

"Captain."

"Speak."

"The Tower Lord has never been wrong, right?"

"...Yes."

Macaron Heijin was born with the bloodline of a witch. Because of this, she had suffered all kinds of humiliation and persecution in the magical world, but it was Kaen and the Sakwol Tower Lord Rudrick who took her in. She used to resent her bloodline, but now she was curious.

Do witches really exist? Is the blood flowing through me truly that of a witch?

Even the Sakwol Tower couldn't clearly identify the existence of witches. As a result, the Myeoramdan could only barely find traces of witches.

But this time, something was different.

"I heard rumors about a 'Witch Restaurant' in Arcanium."

"Yes. They say it appears everywhere?"

Although they didn't know how space magic was handled, witches, who specialized in illusion magic, could use a wide variety of techniques, so they had to keep their possibilities open.

"Honestly, I have no idea how to find it..."

Heijin, with her unusually calm eyes, looked at Arcanium and said.

"But let's give it our best shot!"

Had she ever been this enthusiastic about her work? As far as Kaen could remember, she had never been this motivated since they started working together.

"Yes."

Kaen nodded silently. He didn't say anything unnecessary like 'let's work harder' or 'we can find it.' Just... as always, he would do his best.

Late at night.

Flame visited Baek Yuseol's dormitory as usual. A few days ago, when she first visited his dormitory under the pretext of a hospital visit, she found out that it was quite comfortable and cozy, and even had a lot of snacks. Since then, it had become Flame's haven.

There might be bad rumors if she kept visiting a male student's dormitory every day, but who cares? She didn't care about such things anyway.

Bang, bang, bang!

"I'm here."

She knocked on Baek Yuseol's dormitory door roughly as usual, but there was no response today. Wondering if he was ignoring her, she knocked a few more times, and just then, she made eye contact with Mayuseong, who was passing by the hallway.

"Hello?"

"Oh, Mayuseong. Do you know where Baek Yuseol went?"

"Um... Didn't he go to the library?"

"The library? Does he read books?"

"Yes. He's been going there often lately."

That's strange. Baek Yuseol should have already grasped the truths of this world, so why would he be looking for books now?

'No way...'

The price of manipulating time is all the memories embedded in one's mind. There's no assumption that knowledge wouldn't be lost. So, what kind of book is he looking for?

As Flame pondered, Mayuseong spoke as if he had just remembered something.

"Oh, come to think of it, someone saw him go with a Stella Magic Knight."

"A Stella Knight...?"

That's even more peculiar. What connection could there be between a Stella Knight and Baek Yuseol?

"Hmm... Alright. Thanks."

After waving goodbye to Mayuseong, Flame turned around. She wasn't going back to the dormitory. She had nothing to do at the moment and was bored, so she thought she might as well visit the library.

'I need to find out what book he's so engrossed in.'

If something was happening without her knowledge again, she needed to find out in advance. Since Baek Yuseol would never tell her himself, she had no choice but to find out on her own.
