# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 187

## 42. Isolation (5)

The underground of the Frost Palace. In this secretive and dark space, accessible only to the direct royal family of Adolevit, the sound of footsteps echoed widely. Click! Flames flared up at both ends of the endlessly extending corridor. Emerging from between them was the queen of Adolevit, Hong Seryu. As she took each step forward, the torches on either side ignited. She walked with a facade of calmness, but her steps were filled with anxiety.

Finally, she reached the end of the corridor, where a massive altar stood. Women dressed in pure white nun's habits bowed their heads to the queen without saying a word. 

"Your Majesty, the flames of the Fire Spirit Flower are growing stronger," whispered a courtier quietly to the queen.

"It seems so," she replied.

At the top of the altar's steps was a large jade cup, inside which a single flower was growing. The 'Fire Spirit Flower.' A legendary treasure said to house the 'Incarnation of Fire,' passed down through the Adolevit family for generations. Only the royal family was granted the right to handle it, but no one had ever been able to fully control its power. Upon accepting the Fire Spirit Flower, one would lose all magic and self-control, becoming dominated by the flames and going berserk.

The only ones who had ever managed to handle the Fire Spirit Flower properly were the twelve disciples of the first mage who inherited it, 'Adolevit.' 

"It seems that mixed blood cannot handle it," Hong Seryu thought, snapping her fingers. A silver staff materialized in the air and landed in her hand. As she approached, the Fire Spirit Flower resisted, flaring up violently. She broke into a cold sweat as she struggled to suppress its flames.

Since the day Adolevit first inherited the Fire Spirit Flower, its flames had grown increasingly wild. Each successive king was tasked with suppressing the Fire Spirit Flower upon inheriting the throne, but it seemed that this was the limit for her generation. She had reached a point where she could no longer control its flames. Unless a 9th-class mage proficient in fire magic came, her current level was insufficient.

However, there might be one way. 

"The coast of Levian," she thought. A place where the Incarnation of Ice slumbers, trapping the land in eternal winter. Previous kings had forbidden anyone from touching the coast of Levian, and no one had ever disobeyed, but now she had reached her limit. If she could not suppress the power of the Fire Spirit Flower any longer, a catastrophe unprecedented in history might occur.

Wiping the cold sweat from her brow, Hong Seryu withdrew her hand from the Fire Spirit Flower. "I can't do it with my power alone." Finding the answer from the Incarnation of Ice was essential. "I did not make the wrong choice," she reassured herself, firmly believing in her judgment.

---

Baek Yuseol had been working part-time at the Adolevit Royal Library for about ten days. Nothing much had changed, but if there was one difference, it was the whispers among the people.

"Hey, that's really the princess."

"Yeah, really..."

"Wow, she's so beautiful."

"Shh, your voice is too loud!"

The Royal Library where Baek Yuseol worked had a third-class access restriction, allowing any citizen of Adolevit to enter. If Princess Hong Biyeon started visiting such a place every day, rumors would spread, and the number of visitors would increase rapidly. People often say that seeing cute animals like hamsters or cats, or beautiful and handsome people, is healing. By that logic, Hong Biyeon could be considered a 'healing totem.' Thanks to her sitting quietly in a corner of the Royal Library every day, reading with a fairy-like demeanor, citizens could come and go, refreshing their eyes.

"But why does the princess keep coming to the library all of a sudden?"

"Who knows..."

"I heard she's really temperamental, but she doesn't seem that way."

"Right, she just reads quietly and leaves."

"Last time, someone accidentally bumped into her, and she didn't say anything but handed them a handkerchief."

"Really?"

Baek Yuseol could hear the whispers. They didn't know, but he had a slight idea why Hong Biyeon kept coming here. "She must be lonely," he thought. He didn't know her well, but there was probably no one in the Frost Palace who would side with Hong Biyeon. Queen Hong Seryu must have socially isolated her. In such a situation, how lonely and happy she must have been to meet a familiar face. He thought there was no deeper meaning than that.

Baek Yuseol still remembered that night. The deep night in the library with the lights off. The girl who sat down and cried in the moonlight streaming through the window. But the next day, as if nothing had happened, Hong Biyeon showed the same cold and indifferent demeanor as usual. She spoke bluntly with a cold expression, but something felt subtly different. However, no matter how much he used his ability, he couldn't figure out what it was. It seemed that was the limit of his ability.

"Why does she dress up so much just to come to the library..." he wondered. Her attire always stood out. She often wore what was called a 'princess dress,' adorned with expensive and sparkling jewels. Compared to the ordinary suits of the common citizens, her attire was flashy, but it seemed that people didn't mind because she was so beautiful.

"Phew... I'm so tired today," he sighed. As the day ended and the sun began to set, Hong Biyeon, who had been reading until then, finally stood up. It was about time for Baek Yuseol to finish his shift. After all the visitors had left and the library was filled with silence, Hong Biyeon suddenly spoke to him.

"Commoner."

"Yeah, what?"

"Have you been working here all this time?"

"Yeah, I guess so."

"Then it's meaningless," she thought, speaking up. "Do you have anywhere to go after work?"

"Not really..."

"I'll show you around the castle. Let's go."

"No, I don't really want to..."

"A commoner like you would never set foot in such a place in your lifetime."

"Well, if Princess Hong Biyeon says so, what can a commoner do?" Baek Yuseol finished tidying up the library and approached Hong Biyeon, who was waiting outside. She glanced at him and then walked ahead without saying a word. Baek Yuseol followed her, keeping a slight distance.

A cool breeze blew. While Stella was probably suffering from the midsummer heat, this place was still chilly, perhaps because the Incarnation of Ice was slumbering nearby. It was pleasant in the summer, but in the winter, the extreme cold made it a harsh environment. Before long, they reached an area accessible only to the royal family and their attendants. As they crossed the bridge connecting the castles, Baek Yuseol looked down and felt the majesty of the towering palace anew.

Whoosh... The wind blew, making Hong Biyeon's silver hair flutter. Dozens of white birds flew up. As she walked through them, she looked like a painting, making her seem distant. At that moment, she turned and asked, "How is it?"

"What? What do you mean?"

"What are you spacing out for? Isn't it beautiful?"

Only then did he take in the scenery properly. Standing on the bridge, he could fully appreciate the majesty of the palace towering like a tower. Built on a cliff, it seemed precarious, but that added to its thrilling charm. In that beautiful palace stood Hong Biyeon. She smiled gently, which was unlike her.

"I used to come here often with my sister. So I wanted to show it to you too. This is a place you'll never forget once you see it."

"Yeah, it seems so."

The realistic beauty was incomparable to any game's CG. He stood there, mesmerized, taking in the view of the Frost Cliff Palace. Hong Biyeon watched him. Honestly, since returning to palace life, he was the face she had missed the most. She had thought she would never see him again, so she was incredibly surprised when he suddenly appeared before her. It was so moving that she had cried tears of joy. But that was it. She had to leave the palace. She had accepted that fate. Though they hadn't done much together in the short time they had, just seeing his face was enough. Knowing that he had come to find her was enough to make her happy. So, it was enough. She didn't know how much time she had left, but if she could endure her life by recalling today's happiness, she would find the strength to live.

"Baek Yuseol," she called his name. Perhaps for the first time. "Now, go back."

"What?"

A foolish expression.

"I'm leaving tomorrow. And I won't return to Stella."

"So, if your purpose was to see my face, there's no point in staying here any longer."

Hong Biyeon spoke as if she had chosen this herself. Perhaps she didn't want to show weakness until the end. But Baek Yuseol had no intention of agreeing with her.

"I don't think so."

"What?"

"I know where you're going. The coast of Levian, right? And I know what will happen to you after you go there."

"Of course. You know everything."

She didn't ask how he knew. She just smiled and accepted it. After all, hiding something from Baek Yuseol was probably a foolish thing to do. For someone who had lived through countless repetitions of time, was there anything he didn't know?

"And I think you're mistaken."

He took a step closer to her, closing the distance.

"Do you think I came all the way here just to see your face because I had time to spare?"

"What? No?"

She had thought so. Her heart sank for a moment, but she managed to hold on.

"I came to get you out of here."

Because of his next words, all the emotions piled up in her heart came crashing down.

"Wait..."

She tried to say something, but it got stuck in her throat.

"Do you know what that means?"

"No matter how much you try, it's impossible."

"Don't say foolish things, commoner."

Many sentences passed through her lips, but in the end, all she could manage was one word.

"Why?"

Why? Why indeed.

"Who knows," Baek Yuseol replied with a mischievous smile. He didn't know what to say either.

"So, do you trust me?"

It was a phrase Baek Yuseol often said jokingly. It was so playful and unserious that it was hard to believe, even if one wanted to. But his words had a mysterious power. It felt like anything he said would come true. She had thought it was impossible. She had accepted her fate and despaired, thinking she would live like this forever. She had resolved to endure and persevere, no matter how hard it was, and had steeled herself not to cry, no matter how sad and painful it was. Because there was no hope. Because the future was so bleak. Because she couldn't endure otherwise.

But why could he give her hope so easily?

"I believe you," she replied, as if in a trance, not even understanding what she was doing. But he shook his head.

"No. Actually, the person you should trust isn't me."

"What?"

"I can't get you out of here with my power alone."

"Then..."

"So, you have to save yourself. You might have to risk your life."

She couldn't understand what he was planning. Why would she have to risk her life?

"Do you still want to return to Stella?"

But that question was easy to answer. If she didn't risk her life, she might live in the palace, enjoying luxury for the rest of her life. But if she had to risk her life to return to Stella, the choice was obvious.

"I want to go back."

"Really?"

"Really."

"Then, you have to be prepared."

She bit her lip and clenched her clothes, bowing her head. Baek Yuseol looked at her and burst into laughter again.

"Are you crying again?"

"No."

"It looks like you are."

"No, I'm not."

"Okay, okay, if you say so. Why are you looking at me so fiercely..."

Baek Yuseol took a step back, slightly intimidated by her cold and threatening voice. She looked like a ghost filled with resentment, which was honestly a bit scary.

"I'm going back now."

She walked towards the castle on the other side of the bridge without looking back. Baek Yuseol didn't follow her, and Hong Biyeon didn't return. There was no need for a farewell. They would see each other again today, tomorrow, and the day after.
