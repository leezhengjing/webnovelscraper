### School Competition (3)

The school competition was held in a different location every year. Two years ago, it was at Kaikaren Private Magic School, the year before last at Starflower Magic School, and last year at Molondo Magic School. This year's school competition is being held at Stella Academy. As a result, the students of Stella were extremely busy preparing for the event. Of course, they were not working for free. The students who helped with the preparations were given considerable compensation and benefits, so many commoners chose to stay and work during the summer vacation, calling it a "sweet part-time job." 

However, there were also those who continued with their own tasks, indifferent to such matters.

Boom!

"I brought it."

In the Stella Magic Library, Puleim placed a stack of thick books on the table. Despite her small frame, her strength was astonishing. The other two girls, however, seemed indifferent and each took a book to read.

'The Twelve Divine Moons.'

The existence that Eizel, Hong Biyeon, and Puleim were investigating was the legendary Twelve Divine Moons. After suddenly falling asleep a thousand years ago, they now only existed in the form of faith, and were speculated to be the key to the world's destruction. The twelve lights seen in the Star Library were undoubtedly the remnants left by the Twelve Divine Moons. Additionally, the girls decided to share any information or incidents they knew with each other.

Puleim spoke first.

"...If Baek Yuseol really returned with the power of the 'Silver Eleven Moons,' he wouldn't be able to tell us."

"Why is that?"

"It's similar to being prevented from speaking about the knowledge seen in the Star Library. The moment he reveals future events, he could be erased by the prohibition of 'Heavenly Secrets.'"

No one questioned how Puleim knew this. It was out of respect for each other.

"So, it's impossible to talk directly with Baek Yuseol about this."

"That's right. That man... won't be able to answer anything. He might even avoid us if he realizes we know the secret. If the knowledge of the future leaks to us..."

Eizel, who had experienced it vividly, turned pale.

"...Principal Eltman, who used magic to hear the secrets of the Star Library, collapsed coughing up blood. It was definitely not the right choice."

"To think it was that severe... Even Eltman Eltwin, who is considered the strongest in the world, couldn't withstand it."

The girls' faces darkened.

Next was Hong Biyeon.

"Do you remember the last day of the Familiar Contract Ceremony?"

"Of course."

"We almost died..."

"At that time, I saw something quite strange. After Baek Yuseol defeated Professor Meizen and fainted... one of the Twelve Divine Moons, 'Yeonhongchunsamwol,' was hugging that commoner."

"What, what did you say?"

"The Twelve Divine Moons... appeared directly?"

This shocking revelation made Puleim and Eizel's eyes widen.

"Yes. It was definitely Yeonhongchunsamwol. I didn't know much about that existence, but strangely, I knew the moment I saw it. That was one of the Twelve Divine Moons, the ruler of the power of the mind."

Why was such an existence hugging Baek Yuseol? What kind of relationship did they have?

...If that's the case, is Baek Yuseol really traveling the world to gather the Twelve Divine Moons?

"Come to think of it... he always went out every weekend."

"While handling school schedules, he was traveling the world on weekends."

It was impressive stamina. Or maybe, because of such a tight schedule, he dozed off during class?

"That's true. With his level of knowledge... there's no reason for him to attend the academy."

"Indeed. He should be traveling the world gathering the Twelve Divine Moons, so why maintain school life?"

"There must be a reason. Through countless experiences, he must have found a reason to attend school."

Baek Yuseol's school life was both special and ordinary. He stood out for not using magic, but his grades were always average. This meant that grades were not the reason he attended school.

"Then, the only thing left is... human relationships."

If he intended to solve everything alone in this life, he would have dropped out of school and wandered the world, gathering his strength. But that method was not right. The best choice to prevent the world's destruction was at Stella Academy.

The people he was most interested in after enrolling were...

"...Us?"

Puleim's hollow voice made Eizel and Hong Biyeon press their lips together. It wasn't wrong. Right after enrolling, Baek Yuseol had paid special attention to the three of them.

So that's it... Puleim, who knew the existence of the original novel, could somewhat understand. She was a transmigrator, Eizel was the protagonist of the original, and Hong Biyeon was the top rival with talent equal to the protagonist. 

Moreover, considering that he also paid attention to various other students, including Mayuseong, he might have found some potential in Stella's students.

But the other two girls seemed a bit puzzled.

"Why me?"

They couldn't yet grasp how great a destiny awaited them as grand magicians in the future.

Still...

The fact that Baek Yuseol had been subtly paying attention to them from the beginning made the girls smile faintly.

---

The highest peak of the Primordial Mountain Range. An unnamed ancient castle. 

Aide Orenha came alone to meet their king, Flowerseorin, who ruled over all fairies and elves. Passing through the minimal guard protecting the castle, he knelt at the top, and Flowerseorin made her presence known.

"...You have come, Orenha."

"Yes, Your Majesty."

Her voice was slightly hoarse. It had been a long time since she last spoke. Her voice contained a bewitching power, so she had no choice but to refrain from speaking to avoid enchanting those around her. 

Feeling quite pleased that the only person she could talk to had come, Flowerseorin's footsteps approached the door. However, the door did not open. Orenha had immunity to curses to the extent that he could meet her eyes, but prolonged exposure could still be dangerous.

...Of course, Orenha's "curse immunity" was a blatant lie. He had long been enchanted by Flowerseorin's magic, but he hid that fact completely. Lovesickness? That was a disease for the weak-willed. If one had someone they loved, they should sharpen their abilities and make a thorough plan to win that person over, not suffer alone and die.

Orenha hid all his emotions thoroughly. How many times had he wanted to rush in and confess his love when facing her? If he didn't have the trait [Steel Will], he might have ended up like the others.

"What brings you here?"

Hearing Flowerseorin's excited voice made his heart pound. He spoke as calmly and emotionlessly as possible.

"The school competition starts next week. You don't need to be directly involved, but an invitation has arrived."

"...I see. I cannot go. It's not an important event, just a competition among students. There's no need for the Elf King to appear."

Even without the curse, it wasn't necessary. However, since many prestigious schools participated, it was common for kings or high-ranking nobles to attend. It wasn't strange for the Elf King to go, especially since Eltman Eltwin, who wielded power greater than most kings, would be there.

"I wish to have Your Majesty attend this year's school competition."

"...Is that so?"

When Orenha spoke so firmly, there was always a reason. As her most trusted aide, Flowerseorin did not scold him but asked for the reason.

"Why?"

"I mentioned before that I found traces of the 'Spirit Slayer' Your Majesty has been searching for."

At the mention of the most sensitive term for Flowerseorin, the atmosphere turned cold. The temperature dropped due to the king's power. However, Orenha continued confidently.

"I believe I have found solid evidence."

The school competition is being held at Stella Academy. And... Baek Yuseol is a student there. Orenha had secretly investigated him thoroughly. He even captured a dark mage to interrogate about Baek Yuseol's identity. The conclusion was clear.

"Baek Yuseol is not an ordinary student."

"He has a hidden backer."

He attends school for an extraordinary reason. It was strange for a human to maintain the appearance of a young boy without being a 9th-class grand magician, but that was it.

"He hides dark magic and a corrupted soul... hiding his appearance is not impossible."

He had recently met people who could change their appearance with advanced magic technology. 'The Tower of the Waning Moon.' They operated quietly behind the scenes with overwhelming magical technology, making it possible. The important thing was that appearance alteration was possible.

Baek Yuseol was undoubtedly using such advanced magic technology to hide his true identity while attending Stella. This was not just his own speculation. He had gathered information from numerous dark mage groups, all of whom showed great interest in Baek Yuseol. After absorbing all their information and investigating his actions, he reached this conclusion.

"You cannot deceive me."

Orenha, the greatest high elf in history, still remembered the clear spirit energy he felt from Baek Yuseol. The 'Orb of Souls' he carried had been with him for a month. He could reveal Baek Yuseol's true identity.

This school competition, where the best elite students from around the world gathered, was a very special event. Revealing the truth about Baek Yuseol, who would attract everyone's attention, would not only capture Flowerseorin's heart but also bring significant political, diplomatic, and image benefits.

"...Is that so..."

Flowerseorin, hearing his somewhat vague plan, accepted it with a trembling voice.

"Please... take care of it..."

After saying that, Flowerseorin's voice faded. She was going to spend time alone again to calm her mind. It was pitiful that she had to be alone, but it wasn't the right time yet.

"Soon, you will let me into that room."

Thinking that, Orenha left, and Flowerseorin, now alone, spent time staring blankly out a small window.

'Spirit Slayer... my hatred for him hasn't subsided. I still want to catch the culprit. But... recently, I learned something more important.'

'Iphanel is alive.'

Thanks to someone's grace, Iphanel is still alive. She still couldn't forget. That night when the moonlight shone brightly. The small, young boy in a martial arts uniform. When their eyes, as dark as the universe, met for a moment, it felt like she was being drawn in.

'I must meet him.'

She didn't know his identity or name. But she had to meet him somehow. Beyond the grace of saving Iphanel, he was... completely immune to her curse.

'...Someday, if I can freely go out into the world.'

She would search for him. Thinking that, Flowerseorin closed her eyes. Today... she felt especially tired.
