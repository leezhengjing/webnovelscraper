# Magic School's Teleportation Genius - Chapter 155

## 36. Magic Survival⑺

Boom!!

The brilliant crimson-black flames spread, engulfing everything around them. The soaked hill, the thousand-year-old ancient tree, the pouring rain, and even the thunderstorm were all swallowed by the black flames.

Whoosh...!

Jeliel hastily deployed a shield, but the magic in this virtual world could not properly counter the crimson-black flames that burned everything non-real.

Clang!

With a small shockwave, Jeliel was pushed back and collapsed against the burning ancient tree. She belatedly noticed the black flames spreading to her shoulder and tried to extinguish them, but they wouldn't go out easily.

"This is...!"

These flames couldn't be extinguished by ordinary magic and could burn reality itself. She had read about them in books. The black flames were wielded by one of the strongest bloodlines of the dark mages, the 'Descendants of Iskaram.' The dark mage before her had inherited the blood of Iskaram from ancient times and could freely control the black flames. However, it seemed that he had not inherited the direct bloodline but a derivative, as the flames were murky and mixed with a significant amount of crimson. The destructive power itself was far less than the infamous Iskaram, who was said to have turned an entire city to ashes in an instant.

But could she win?

"...Impossible."

The burning pain from her shoulder confirmed it. These flames could indeed consume and burn her to nothing.

Using the recently acquired level 4 artifact staff to support herself, she struggled to stand and calmly faced the approaching Veroncal. She analyzed her chances of victory and survival, considering the terrain and the items she had acquired to find a way to escape from the enemy. Even with death approaching right before her eyes, Jeliel could think coldly, treating even herself as a pawn.

She did not love herself. To her, her existence was merely a command tower manipulating pawns, and she was willing to use herself as long as it was beneficial.

"What are you thinking so much about? Hm? You look very worried, young lady," Veroncal said, curling his lips as he approached Jeliel. He had already noticed who the girl before him was. A high elf girl, Jeliel, of the highest noble status in the world, born into a blessed family with innate talent. If he burned her here, his name would undoubtedly be recorded as a dark mage who left a significant scar on the magical world.

Thump, thump!

His heart pounded, and the blood flowing through his veins made his head and chest even hotter.

"How should I torment her?"

She must have lived thinking she was the best. He wanted to slowly and artistically ruin that face. He would burn her beautiful face, praised by everyone, so that no one could love it, and he would tear out her hands and tongue so she could never use magic again.

"Haha, I look forward to seeing that cold gaze distort! Women like you are fun to torment!"

Whoosh!

He lightly swung his right arm, sending black flames flying. Jeliel didn't defend but instead threw herself to the side, rolling on the ground. It was dirty and unsightly for a wizard's battle, but it was the best decision.

Jeliel then pointed her staff at Veroncal. Anticipating an incoming spell, Veroncal took a defensive stance, but...

Whoosh...!

Jeliel didn't use magic. Instead, she used the 'Jumping Shooter' artifact to leap high into the air.

"Hah, a petty trick!"

But as if it was nothing, Veroncal snapped his fingers, and flames formed and exploded right in front of Jeliel's nose.

"What...!"

Boom!!

"Ugh...!"

The recoil sent Jeliel crashing back to the ground. Fortunately, she felt little pain from the fall, but the flames had spread to most of her upper body. The pain was so intense that she couldn't even scream, but Jeliel gritted her teeth and tried to understand the cause.

"The range for creating coordinates is unimaginably long."

Ordinary wizards couldn't form 'target' magic at such a long distance. The downside of target magic was that it had a short range and weak destructive power, as it activated instantly in mid-air. This meant that the dark mage before her was optimized for target magic...

"Escaping is impossible."

After making her decision, she rolled backward with all her might, and a mass of flames fell in front of her.

"Haha, you tried to escape? Now that you know it's useless, what will you do? Hm?"

Whoosh! Boom!

Veroncal tossed black flames at Jeliel as if playing with a ball. Each time, she hid behind a tree or threw a shield artifact to somehow offset the attacks, but it was clear she couldn't hold out for long.

"There is a way."

A dark mage estimated to be a level 5 risk. Normally, she wouldn't be able to win, but the stage had many artifacts with special abilities. A plan was already forming in her mind, and she had perfectly designed a route to escape.

Tap, tap...

Jeliel looked down at her burning upper body. It was hot and painful, but strangely, she didn't scream or cry.

"There's not much time."

Soon, the flames would consume her entire upper body and burn her whole body. If she could survive, she could be healed without a single scar. So, she had to survive somehow.

Resolutely, Jeliel pointed her staff at the sky. A green magic circle began to form, and the thousand-year-old tree's branches shook.

Rumble!!

"Spirit Magic, Elpion Summon."

A high elf's highest-level magic that could revive and control the will of plants. Although she was only a 4th class and couldn't summon a powerful spirit, this would be enough.

Boom, rumble!!

-Roar!

The spirit Elpion, entwined with branches, was stronger during the day when it rained. Although it was night and could only receive half the buff, the pouring rain would make Elpion even sturdier.

"Hah, elves know how to use interesting magic?"

Veroncal snapped his fingers lightly, and the black flames that erupted without even a staff burned Elpion's upper body entirely. But Elpion continued to advance towards Veroncal without stopping.

"Haha! Don't you realize it's useless yet?"

Even as he sent flames towards Elpion, Veroncal sharpened his dark mage senses to keep an eye on his surroundings. It would be troublesome if Jeliel escaped. Fortunately for Veroncal, this place was the top of an open hill, and the only place to hide was the thousand-year-old tree. In other words, if he defeated Elpion, Jeliel would have nothing left.

"Is this all you could come up with?"

Each time Veroncal's flames exploded, Elpion's body crumbled. Arms fell, legs collapsed, and the entire body was engulfed in flames, yet Elpion steadfastly walked towards Veroncal.

"Hah... Hitting a puppet is no fun."

Just as he was about to finish off Elpion, he noticed something.

"Hm?"

Crack!!

Roots of the thousand-year-old tree sprouted from all directions. They were meant to create obstacles to block his view.

"Pathetic tricks!"

Veroncal stomped the ground, scattering waves of crimson-black flames in all directions. Most of the roots burned and were cut off, but the thousand-year-old tree continued to grow.

"Is this desperation? I heard you were smart, but that must have been a lie. You're wasting mana on useless things!"

Of course, Jeliel was replenishing her mana with a survival-specific artifact called 'Mana Recovery Potion,' but Veroncal, who didn't know the game's rules, was unaware.

Boom! Boom!!

"Haha! Where are you hiding? Do you think you can escape like this? You're cuter than you look!"

The futile attempt to block his view didn't work. His intense flames burned even the rain, leaving the surroundings wide open, and there was nowhere for Jeliel to hide.

Tap, tap...!

"Hm?"

At that moment, a black orb rolled towards his feet. Realizing it was an artifact, Veroncal enveloped himself in black flames.

Flash!

A bright light burst out, but Veroncal took no damage. Even if he had been hit by the flashbang, he would have quickly recovered, as he had fully unleashed his dark power.

"Your actions are getting cuter."

Using artifacts in such a forced manner meant she was truly cornered. Veroncal leisurely walked towards the ancient tree. Cutting down the roots rushing at him was an easy task.

Beep, beep—Boom!

The landmine-type artifact planted on the ground activated, but he erased it with flames from his feet. The 'Mana Nullification Bomb' artifact fired from the gaps in the tree was also reduced to ashes in mid-air.

A battle between fire and wood. An extreme mismatch. Moreover, the fire was of a higher level.

"Hahaha!"

The thought of toying with the best student of the prestigious Starflower Magic School, the high elf Jeliel, made Veroncal laugh heartily.

"Come out now!"

He summoned a massive ball of flames into the air. Even then, Jeliel only controlled the tree roots without showing herself.

"Stupid girl!"

He didn't intend to kill her, so he adjusted the power. He would burn all the trees but keep Jeliel alive, increasing the size and firing it forward.

...Whoosh, boom!!

A violent explosion covered the world. It wasn't just burning the trees; it was a grotesque power that shattered them into pieces.

"Come out now!"

The black flames didn't even produce smoke, so his view wasn't obstructed. Veroncal shouted loudly as he dug through the gaps in the completely burned tree.

"Where are you? Come out quickly! You might die if you're not careful!"

No response. Jeliel didn't show herself. The roots that had been annoyingly wriggling around fell limply to the ground, and no other presence was felt.

"...Hm? What?"

Veroncal looked around in confusion.

"This can't be... I definitely adjusted the power. It shouldn't have caused significant damage to Jeliel hiding behind. I intended to play with her more..."

"Could she be dead?"

Snap!

He extinguished the flames and focused his senses, searching through the remains of the tree. But there was no place for a person to hide in the completely destroyed tree. He even used mana to detect the ground, thinking she might have used earth magic to dig, but found nothing.

"Is she really... dead? Just like that? Without even playing with her?"

He had intended to play with her to death, but he felt strangely empty. He hadn't fully enjoyed the pleasure. Then, a sudden thought struck him, and Veroncal ran towards Elpion's corpse, shoving his hand inside.

Whoosh! Boom!

"Ugh...!"

Jeliel was flung out from inside Elpion, rolling on the ground. Her entire body was already burned black, teetering on the edge of life and death, but she wasn't dead yet.

"...You. You're truly a crazy woman."

Veroncal's chest turned cold. He hadn't expected her to hide herself inside Elpion, which he thought was just a decoy.

"Did you not think you might burn to death? Stupid woman."

Actually, it was the opposite. Jeliel had been prepared to burn to death, hiding inside Elpion. Because... it was the only way to escape this place. If Veroncal hadn't noticed something suspicious at the last moment, Jeliel would have escaped the arena and chosen to forfeit, receiving treatment. But she had failed.

Jeliel looked up at Veroncal with cold, dead eyes. She had no strength left to move. She was barely breathing.

Even if he wanted to torment her more, he couldn't. How could he play with a toy that would break with a single touch? Veroncal's face twisted like a demon, and he ground his teeth.

"Damn, it's no fun anymore."

The pleasure of tormenting someone who cried and screamed in pain was gone... This woman was truly like a 'doll.' A wind-up doll that moved silently towards its goal without any emotion. Perhaps, even in this moment of death, she was accepting it calmly.

But contrary to Veroncal's thoughts, Jeliel's mind was quite complicated.

"I can't die..."

It wasn't because she had a desire for life. The only reason she lived was for her father, Melian.

"If I die... there will be no one to cure my father..."

Her father, Melian, had been suffering from an incurable disease for a long time. Despite gathering the best doctors from around the world, there was no cure. After decades of searching, no solution was found, and Melian, considering it a waste of his one and only life, had long given up and focused on his business. The reason he had been teaching young Jeliel about management was precisely because of this. He wanted her to live on her own strength after he was gone.

But Jeliel had no intention of letting her father die.

"The ancient ruins of Karmenset."

She was so close to finding a way. She had almost found the traces of the ruins. If she could just enter that place, she could save her father. Did she have to die in vain?

"If I die, no one will find the ruins."

Everyone still considered the ruins of Karmenset a legend. They believed that the immortal life, which even the first wizards couldn't achieve, didn't exist.

"If I go a little further, I can save my father..."

The rain poured down heavily. Even though she knew it was fake rain, Jeliel felt a strange sense of reality. Perhaps it was because death was right before her eyes.

"...I don't like that look in your eyes until the end."

Jeliel's transparent eyes, as if looking at everything in the world dryly, made Veroncal feel uncomfortable. Perhaps she was the type of person dark mages, who lived for pleasure, hated the most.

"There's no point in playing with you anymore."

Even as Veroncal reached out his hand, countless thoughts branched out in Jeliel's mind. How could she escape from here? Would begging for her life make him spare her? Would he enjoy it and torment her even more? Was there another way through artifacts and strategic magic?

...No. No matter how much she thought, there was no way. Even Jeliel's brain, which always found an answer no matter what happened, couldn't come up with any solution this time. Thinking that, she felt she could understand the emotion called 'sadness' a little. Facing death, she felt not fear or anger, but sadness. It was a truly ironic emotion.

"I'm going to die."

Unless a miracle like a lightning bolt from the sky struck. Her last thought was just a vain hope. Facing death, she was becoming like everyone else. Thinking that, a laugh escaped her. So Jeliel laughed. It was the first genuine smile she had ever shown.

Seeing Jeliel laugh, Veroncal reached out his hand.

"Now, die."

Crimson-black flames rose like death. Jeliel quietly closed her eyes as she watched them.

...Flash! Boom!!

Suddenly, a massive lightning bolt struck. Like a miracle.
