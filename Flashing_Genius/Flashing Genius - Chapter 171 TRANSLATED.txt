### Chapter 171: The Seventh Tower (2)

The culprit is actually the protagonist. It might be hard to understand without context, but I felt no need to drag out the story, so I started with the conclusion.

"Baek Yuseol! You have a talent for ghost hunting. I, the world's greatest ghost hunter, guarantee it."

"Will you call me Master Pung Ryujin from now on?"

"No."

"That's unfortunate."

Currently, I am in the haunted village of Malentares for an event. Having successfully met Pung Ryujin, the ghost hunter who is the main character of this side event, the main content is to solve the mysteries occurring in the village.

To summarize, the ghost that was tormenting the villagers was actually Pung Ryujin himself, and he realizes this through the player, leading to his peaceful departure. The direction and story were quite touching and had a twist, so it received some praise, but many found it too predictable, similar to the movie 'The Sixth Sense.'

Moreover, the quest pattern was monotonous: "Oh no, there's a rumor of a ghost! Let's investigate!" Pung Ryujin would rush off, and the player would follow to defeat the monster, repeating endlessly. It was honestly boring.

So, was I dissatisfied? Not at all. Thanks to Pung Ryujin, I could catch powerful monsters that I couldn't handle on my own, making it quite profitable. No wonder this side event is considered a jackpot.

"Your help is invaluable. After this is over, would you consider working as my assistant? You have guts, courage, and great skills."

"Not really..."

"Baek Yuseol, you have everything, but you lack a clear sense of purpose. What is your dream?"

"To prevent the world's destruction."

"Haha! That's absurd, but you need that kind of ambition. I once dreamed of world conquest."

Being a ghost hunter is a job that could starve you to death. Why would I choose it over the promising future of a magic warrior? If the world doesn't end, I'll live well with my magic warrior certification, living in luxury.

"Well, it's a shame. It's about time for me to retire. But even without me, there will still be wandering spirits in the world."

Pung Ryujin looked into the void with a bitter expression.

"This world is filled with spirits who haven't found peace. I believe it's my duty to relieve their grudges. How much regret must they have to remain on this land even after death?"

"Indeed."

What kind of grudges do they have? He puffed on his pipe, occasionally staring blankly into space. No smoke came out of the pipe, which was one of the proofs that Pung Ryujin was a ghost. When I didn't know anything, I thought it was a graphic error.

"Still, I've almost reached the peak. Do you see that mansion? They say a woman cries sorrowfully there every night."

"I see it clearly."

"Tonight, we will infiltrate that place. This time, for sure."

It's been a week since I arrived in Malentares. The story is nearing its end. The crying woman in the mansion is not a ghost. And as everyone might have guessed, she was someone Pung Ryujin loved in life. He died protecting her, and even in death, he wandered nearby to protect her, becoming a vengeful spirit—a heartbreaking story.

When I read the story, I thought it was clichéd and trite, but seeing the person involved right in front of me, I couldn't just laugh it off.

"This time, let's solve the case for sure."

For that reason, while Pung Ryujin set off energetically, my shoulders felt heavy. I already knew what fate awaited him.

"Let's do it."

Despite that, I followed him. Whether fate was predetermined or not, I came here prepared for this situation. Sometimes, knowing the future isn't always a good thing.

"Sigh... What am I thinking?"

Let's not get sentimental. I have to do something more dangerous and possibly more difficult. I need to quickly finish this event and return to Stella to prepare for the black magic erosion with Flame. Time-wise... nothing significant should have happened yet. Even though the future has changed considerably, I hope it remains quiet.

"Let's go!"

With a heavy heart, I chased after Pung Ryujin. There are still too many things to do to get lost in thoughts.

* * *

Most of the ghost stories Angel heard from her father were true.

1. After midnight, when the moonlight shines on the D-3 corridor on the 12th floor of the Fifth Tower, do not look at the grandfather clock in the corner. There is no grandfather clock on the 12th floor. If you find a grandfather clock, leave quickly before it chimes twelve times.

2. Around 3 AM, when entering the basement of the Fourth Tower, always go in pairs. If you go in alone, don't try to find the exit. Quietly go to a corner, close your eyes, and spend the night there. At least you won't end up in a strange place.

Angel's ghost stories were more like urban legends, not particularly scary. They were just one of the ways to reach the Seventh Tower. But not all of them would work. In the original story, Angel tried all the ghost stories and only succeeded in re-entering the Seventh Tower after dozens of attempts. This means the conditions written in the ghost stories don't always apply.

Around that time, strange things started happening at the school.

"Do you know the ghost story of the Seventh Tower? If the water is running in the girls' bathroom at midnight, close your eyes and count to ten."

"Yeah, I know."

"Recently, senior Henetley experienced it."

"What? That's impossible. There's no girls' bathroom there."

"That's what makes it scarier. The senior was so shocked, but remembered the ghost story and immediately closed his eyes and counted to ten. Suddenly, the bathroom disappeared."

"Is it true...?"

"I don't think that serious senior would lie."

It wasn't just once or twice.

"Did you hear about Avex in the Sixth Tower?"

"Of course. He saw a pool of blood on the floor while walking in the early morning."

"That's a lie. He always exaggerates."

"But he was trembling like a madman and was taken to the infirmary. If he was acting, he deserves an award."

Ghost stories started spreading all over Stella. Some students even went back home, and even the diligent students who attended classes regularly stayed in their dorms, not daring to come out. At night, they were too scared to walk alone, so they moved in groups.

"Something... feels off."

It's only been a day since Hong Biyeon went missing. But suddenly, the situation escalated this much.

- The Stella Magic Knights will personally handle the ghost story incidents, so students, please focus on your studies without worry.

Stella announced that they would investigate with full force, but it was useless. The ghost stories only affected students, not the magic knights or professors. It was as if the ghost stories were selective.

This was the scariest part of this episode. Even though incidents were happening within the school, the professors couldn't help at all. By the third day, students started disappearing one by one. Despite the professors patrolling all the corridors of the towers every night, they couldn't stop the students from being drawn into the ghost stories. What kind of magic is this? A mystery that even the world's best magic institution, Stella, couldn't solve.

'Could it be Abelain's magic?'

On a dark night, with only a magic orb for light, Flame walked down the corridor without any fear.

'It's terrifying to experience it firsthand.'

Even in the modern world of science, unexplained mysteries cause fear. The same goes for the magical world of Aether. Mysteries that can't be explained by magic. But this isn't just a mystery or an enigma; it's real magic. It's just that it's 'surreal magic' that surpasses the level of modern magicians.

Even knowing it's magic, it's hard to believe. How much more terrifying must it be for ordinary people? By now, Elteman Eltewin would have realized the nature of this incident. The ghost stories are fragments of reality manipulation magic left by Abelain, who disappeared over half a century ago. But waiting for him to solve it would be too late. The summer vacation is far from over, and the 'ghost story disappearance incident' has already started. Soon, it will escalate to the black magic erosion of the Seventh Tower.

'Before that, I need to enter the Seventh Tower.'

It took a few days, but I finished all the preparations. I gathered various artifacts from outside cities and special items made by Alteisha from the wings of angels I met in my dreams, filling my backpack. I have a good grasp of what will happen inside from the original story, so it should be fine.

"...It's a bit eerie."

Angel, who was following Flame, said. We don't know if we'll experience a ghost story today. The current situation is similar to what happened in the original story. One day, Angel was kidnapped to the Seventh Tower but escaped with the help of Haewonryang. However, when students started disappearing one by one, she decided to use the ghost stories to enter the Seventh Tower to prevent further harm. But the process wasn't easy. Ghost stories don't just happen whenever you want. She wandered all the towers alone every night to make the ghost stories come true.

'At least... it will take a week.'

Like back then, it won't be easy for Flame and Angel to encounter a ghost story. Even more so now, with Anella included, making three people. Ghost stories are more likely to occur when you're alone, so it might take even longer. If there's no sign of a ghost story by the third day, I'll suggest moving separately.

...But then.

"Huh?"

Splash! As I stepped forward, cold water splashed. Looking down the corridor, it was filled with cold water. No doubt, this is also a ghost story.

※ While walking on the 15th floor of the Fourth Tower, if the corridor is filled with water... and so on. The content is something like that. It doesn't matter. The important thing is that we got caught in a ghost story.

"It's... a ghost story."

Angel said nervously, and Flame nodded. But... something feels off.

'On the first try?'

We didn't try multiple times. Just once. Today, we approached a ghost story for the first time and succeeded on the first try. Does this make sense?

'Is it just a coincidence...?'

I wanted to believe that, but I couldn't shake off the uneasy feeling.

"Let's go. According to the ghost story, we shouldn't walk to the end of the corridor, so we should do the opposite."

"Yeah, let's go."

There's no other way. I had a strong suspicion that someone was intentionally leading us, but we had no choice but to go there. Many students were still missing, and more importantly, Hong Biyeon, whom Baek Yuseol had painstakingly saved from evil, was trapped there.

So, without hesitation, we moved forward.

"Wait."

A boy's voice came from behind. Knowing who it was, Flame turned with a stern expression.

"...Jeremy."

"Yeah, Flame."

A boy with golden hair that shone like stars even without starlight, Jeremy Scalven. There was no reason for Jeremy to be here at this hour, so it could only mean he had followed Flame.

"Why did you follow me?"

"...I had no choice. To protect you. Please, don't go any further."

"Why?"

"Can't you feel something strange? This is... luring you."

"Hah, luring? The only ridiculous thing here is your usual nonsense."

I know. Flame knows too, but we have no choice but to go.

"Besides, who would lure me and for what purpose?"

"...I can't say."

"Oh, acting like you know something?"

"Sorry."

Jeremy shook his head firmly but didn't back down from his opinion.

"Don't go any further. It's very... dangerous."

"No. We have to go."

"...Why?"

"Friends are trapped."

"To save them? It's impossible with your power. Even the professors can't find them."

"I know. But we still have to go."

Seeing Flame's unwavering determination, Jeremy smiled bitterly, as if he expected this.

"Then... I'll go with you."

"What?"

"I can't just watch you go there."

"Are you crazy? Suddenly..."

Angel and Anella had already stepped back. They were wary of Jeremy Scalven. So was Flame. He would be a great asset, but he was too burdensome to be with.

"Go back. I have no intention of working with you."

"...Just as you won't listen to me, I'll do as I please. I'll follow you from a distance."

After saying that, Jeremy stepped back ten paces.

"I won't interfere. I'll keep my distance. I won't talk to you. Just let me watch over you from afar. Is that... not okay?"

Honestly, I didn't want to allow even that. Flame hated Jeremy as a person. But knowing that Jeremy wouldn't back down, she turned and walked ahead without a word. Angel and Anella followed, and Jeremy trailed from a distance. Thus, an odd and mismatched group of four began their exploration of the Seventh Tower.
