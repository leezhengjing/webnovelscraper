### Chapter 232: The Start of the Semester (6)

Late at night, a female student sneaking into the male dormitory could easily become a scandal if witnessed, but neither Flame nor Bai Yuseol cared about such things.

“What’s going on?” Bai Yuseol asked with a tired face as Flame squeezed into his dorm room.

Flame flopped onto his bed, flailing her limbs. “Is this an S-Class bed?”

“You’re in S-Class too.”

“I share a dorm with F-Class students. Didn’t you know that?”

“How would I know?”

“Well, I’ve borrowed beds in A-Class and D-Class dorms before, but this is the best. I’ve never used an S-Class bed.”

Bai Yuseol stirred the porridge Flame had brought. Many students had visited him, some even bringing homemade dishes, but Flame had brought cheap instant porridge from a convenience store.

“…Why?”

“I never get a chance to enter the S-Class dorms. The girls are all nasty, and entering the boys’ dorms is a big deal. Besides, A-Class has double rooms, but S-Class has singles.”

“Isn’t this a big deal for me?”

Though he had no appetite, Bai Yuseol decided the porridge was worth eating and put it in the dorm’s microwave. However, he didn’t know how to use it. Unlike modern 21st-century microwaves, the machines in the Aether World were operated with magic circles and runes, making them quite complex. While the average Aetherian was familiar with these, Bai Yuseol was not, having never used one in the dorm.

‘Woodpecker glasses…’ He fumbled in his pockets, but Flame came over and pressed the magic circles with her fingers, operating it for him.

“By the way, are you sick?”

“Yeah.”

“Why?”

“I’ve been through a lot recently.”

“Hmm… Is it related to the Starcloud Trading Company issue?”

After returning to Stella, Flame had read about the dramatic return of the missing chairman of the Starcloud Trading Company, with Bai Yuseol prominently mentioned.

“Well, it’s a bit different.”

“…Really?”

Beep! Beep! Beep! The microwave signaled. Bai Yuseol took out the porridge and began eating it slowly with a plastic spoon. Flame, lying with her legs crossed, reached out with her foot to nudge the bread and snacks piled on the table.

“Aren’t you going to eat the cotton cookies?”

“You can have them.”

“Thanks!”

As Flame picked up a candy box with her toes, Bai Yuseol looked at her in disbelief, then resumed eating his porridge, thinking she was always like this.

“By the way,” Flame said, sucking on a candy, “aren’t you overdoing it lately?”

“…What do you mean?”

“You’ve never stayed still in Stella throughout the summer vacation.”

As soon as summer vacation started, he left somewhere, returned immediately to resolve the Seventh Tower ghost story incident, then left for Adolevit. He intervened in the royal succession battle, stopped a disaster on the Levian coast, and resolved the Starcloud chairman’s disappearance in the Hawol Plains. A normal student would be busy juggling homework and study, but he was involved in major incidents worldwide. How could he not be exhausted?

Moreover, ‘I probably don’t know everything…’ Even the time travel incident with Angel showed that if she hadn’t had the chance to interfere with the past, she would never have known what Bai Yuseol was doing. He must have experienced countless incidents worldwide that she didn’t know about.

“If you burn out your stamina too quickly, you might really collapse later,” she said lightly, trying to make it a joke, but Bai Yuseol stopped eating.

“…What, why?”

Feeling awkward, Flame replied, and Bai Yuseol chuckled. “It’s just… that’s not something you should be saying.”

“Huh?”

Bai Yuseol had played Aether World Online and knew the character Flame. Many male protagonists had been involved with her, and she had always tried to solve everything on her own. The line the male protagonists commonly said to ‘Character Flame’ was eerily similar to what the real Flame just said, making him feel strange.

‘Come to think of it, I’ve been living a busy life.’ In his past life on Earth, he had never worked hard at anything and considered himself a lazy, ordinary person. If the old Bai Yuseol saw his current self, desperately striving for something, what would he think?

“You’re right,” he said dryly, then resumed eating his porridge. Flame licked her candy-stained lips and said casually, “Next time, if something happens, I’ll help a bit. Don’t do it all alone.”

Bai Yuseol just smiled. Whether it was a positive or negative response, Flame couldn’t tell, feeling frustrated. Probably, it was closer to a negative response. Why? Was there a reason he couldn’t accept her help?

‘Is it because of our relationship before the regression?’ In another timeline, Bai Yuseol must have experienced countless incidents with ‘another Flame.’ She didn’t want to think about it, but maybe she had been seriously injured or killed in the process. Or perhaps her involvement led to the worst outcomes. Otherwise, there was no reason for him to refuse all help and act alone.

…Probably. Flame wanted to think so.

A week had passed since the start of the semester. It was time for practical training to begin. Bai Yuseol, who had spent the first week lying in his dorm bed, had to start attending classes.

‘I’m so tired…’ Despite resting all week, he still felt exhausted. It wasn’t just because of the subspace engraved in his heart but also the hardships he endured throughout the summer vacation. The accumulated fatigue hit him all at once as he finally relaxed.

“From now on, you will train to find the ‘Black Mage’s Hideout,’” Instructor Lihanwol explained to the S-Class students gathered in the transformed Stella Dome, now a dense forest.

“Black Mages hide all over the world, making it difficult for us wizards to find them. If they hide, we must train to find them.”

One of the mandatory subjects in the first semester was ‘Black Mage Psychology.’ Why do Black Mages act the way they do? How do we fight them? Where do they hide? After studying these theories for half a year, it was time to put them to use.

“Students from other classes are also training to find the Black Mage’s hideout somewhere in this area. But as S-Class, the same training would be meaningless.”

Higher than A-Class, S-Class always received differentiated education, and this time was no exception.

“You will find a special Black Mage’s hideout.”

Just as wizards are divided into various attributes like lightning, fire, and curses, Black Mages also have numerous factions. Among them are those who were rejected by the wizarding world and turned to black magic, such as Black Sorcerers, Necromancers, Witches, and Cursers. Unlike typical Black Mages who directly contract with the otherworld, these individuals only accept black mana and have no direct connection to the otherworld. This makes them irregular beings, rejected by both the wizarding world and Black Mages.

“Witches are said to be extinct, and most Necromancers have hidden, so there’s no need to train for them. However, 12 years ago, a witch’s hideout was discovered, causing a stir.”

Though the students were only five years old at the time, it was a famous story, and they all nodded. Witches, though few in number, are extremely dangerous. Ordinary wizards can’t handle them, and there were special hunting teams just for witch hunts. However, witches had completely disappeared from the world decades ago, and it was believed to be safe now… until a witch’s hideout was suddenly discovered.

“Thus, the wizarding world concluded that a few witches must still be hiding somewhere in the world.”

Therefore, the magic schools still include witch-related education in their curriculum. No one knows when or where someone might encounter a witch.

“From F-Class to A-Class, students form teams, but you will work individually and target special Black Mage hideouts.”

As expected, Lihanwol’s story wasn’t just for show. It was clear that S-Class would be tasked with finding a special Black Mage’s hideout.

“The results of this practical training will be reflected in your performance evaluation. Do your best. That’s all.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Lihanwol’s figure blurred and disappeared. Silence fell over the forest. The S-Class students glanced at each other and began to scatter in all directions without a word.

Mayuseong, with an intrigued look, followed Haewonryang, who had set off first. Angel and Heungbiyun exchanged glances, then quickly turned away and entered the forest in opposite directions. Pung Harang stayed behind, observing the students’ movements. He wanted to remember the positions of the fastest students to decide his search route, as overlapping routes wouldn’t be beneficial.

He glanced at Flame, who seemed deep in thought, unable to move easily. Then she ran to Bai Yuseol, who was yawning, and whispered something in his ear. Pung Harang tried to ignore it, focusing on analyzing the terrain, sensing mana, and thinking of the best hiding spots for Black Mages. He needed to find the hideout faster than anyone else…

“…Really?” Bai Yuseol’s voice.

“Yeah, really!” Flame’s excited voice.

The two soon disappeared into the forest, and Pung Harang, unable to resist, started walking in their direction.

‘…This direction is the most efficient. I’m going this way because it’s the best route to find the Black Mage’s hideout. There are only seven possible routes, and I just happened to choose the same one.’

Pung Harang kept repeating this to himself as he quietly but quickly followed the path Bai Yuseol and Flame had taken. He didn’t understand why he was doing it.
