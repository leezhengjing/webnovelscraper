# I Became a Genius in the Magic School 247

## 49. Witch (14)

The night sky, tinged with dawn, was closer to a violet hue rather than pitch-black darkness, making it less dark and fearsome than one might think. Under the purple sky, in the center of the floating Arcanium, Kaen, who was gazing at the massive glass shard rising from the center, spoke softly.

"Success."

Immediately, the 'Illusion World' began to crack like a spider web and gradually started to shatter into pieces.

"Wow, that's really amazing. Right, Hyeijin? As an illusion mage, you must understand how incredible that idea is."

"…Don't talk to me. I'm exhausted."

Hyeijin, sprawled on the rooftop of a building, was struggling to catch her breath. Next to her, Angel, who was also exhausted and nearly unconscious, seemed unable to open her eyes properly due to mana depletion.

"But, well… it was impressive, wasn't it? Those kids."

Angel, too tired to hear, and Flame, who had jumped directly into the Illusion World, couldn't hear, but Hyeijin expressed pure admiration.

"You have to overlay your illusion on that barrier."

A girl named Flame had proposed a very unique idea. It was something that no one would have thought of, and even if they had, it was so close to impossible that they wouldn't have attempted it. Normally, one cannot cast illusion magic on objects. Most would think so and give up, but the girl chose to bypass the impossible.

"Use the Atrax Core."

"What? How do you know about that…?"

The Tower of Sakwol had a variety of artifacts, including legendary items that were historically lost and thought to have disappeared. The 'Atrax Core' was one of them. In modern times, there were no mages who could use it, and its existence was so veiled that finding a mage who knew about it was difficult. It was quite shocking to hear such a word come out of the mouth of a mere seventeen-year-old girl.

"There’s no time to explain. We will use the Atrax Core to overlay magic on reality."

"But if we do that…"

"The mana in the air will be contaminated. But we don't have to worry about that. The space we will overlay with magic is not the Arcanium… it's the Illusion Barrier."

At that moment, Hyeijin instantly grasped Flame's intention. Her illusion magic couldn't be cast on objects. However, the Atrax Core was a unique artifact that could imbue reality with breath, giving objects a will. Normally, this function was useless, but for Hyeijin, it worked a bit differently.

"You're thinking of casting an illusion on the Illusion Barrier itself and pulling it into reality…?"

"That's right."

She broke into a cold sweat, contemplating. Casting an illusion on that massive barrier could result in not just fainting but outright death. But there was no need to worry.

"I'll help you."

This time, Angel stepped forward and began drawing a magic circle on the ground. There was no need to ask what she was doing. Just by looking, it was clear. It was a reconstruction of illusion magic for Hyeijin. When a mage draws a magic circle, they bear the full burden themselves. Every line, dot, pattern, and rune in the magic circle. However, Angel chose a very unique method, using 'mana stones' as the medium.

Of course, anyone can use mana stones as a medium. It is the most basic method when drawing installation-type magic circles. All everyday mechanical devices, including fluorescent lights, fans, and air conditioners, use these mana stones. But that's only for supplying low-output mana steadily, like a 'battery,' and is not suitable for practical magic that requires 'generation.' Such an auxiliary method is not only unhelpful but can also be dangerous, as the mana stone could shatter immediately upon casting, posing a risk to the caster.

That is, if one thinks normally.

"The buildings of Arcanium are all designed and planned."

Until she heard Angel's calm words.

"No way."

Hyeijin immediately looked up at the sky of Arcanium. Buildings rising to the same height at regular intervals. Some buildings were 50 stories, some 70, and some 79. All different heights, but when expanded across the entire Arcanium, they strictly adhered to the rule of height in the form of a 'circle.'

"We will use the buildings of Arcanium to create a very large three-dimensional magic circle."

And so, back to the present.

Crash-!!!

The Illusion Barrier crumbled, proving the success of the two girls' collaboration.

"Amazing… truly."

Even Metra, who rarely praised, was impressed, and Kaen couldn't hide his surprise.

"Ugh…"

Hyeijin forced herself to stand up and leaned against the building's railing.

"The witch… The reason we went through all this trouble was to find the witch."

She tried to look down at the ground with a pale face, but Kaen shook his head.

"It's too late."

Immediately, the scene before her eyes.

Thud!!

Baek Yuseol's sword pierced the witch's heart.

"…Ah."

Watching the witch fall powerlessly, Hyeijin sighed in frustration.

"Ahhh… my fate… Is it really going to end like this…?"

After all the hardships, the witch died without even meeting her.

"It can't be helped."

"Yeah, Kaen is right. There must be a reason for killing the witch."

Shortly after, Baek Yuseol also collapsed with a pale face, and Flame ran to catch him. Soon, the Arcanium's guardian magic warriors broke through the barrier and entered. Watching them, Metra whistled.

"Whistle~ This time, it's something amazing. Is that… the body of a witch hunter?"

"A witch hunter?"

"Oh, Kaen can't see it. When a witch hunter dies, they leave traces of mana instead of a body."

"Another witch hunter's body."

"Did the witch kill him too?"

"Who knows. Anyway, witch hunters are harmful to the world, so it's better if they're gone. Whether Baek Yuseol killed him or the witch did, it doesn't matter, right?"

He's not wrong. Witches are harmful to the world. But witch hunters, who kill witches, are even more harmful and dangerous. The story of a witch hunter who destroyed an entire kingdom's capital to catch a single witch is still famous, and the hatred and anger towards them are no less than those towards witches.

"It's a pity Hyeijin couldn't meet the witch, but at least we confirmed that both the witch and the witch hunter are dead. The world will be noisy for a while again. A witch, thought to have disappeared, suddenly appeared and attacked the Arcanium."

Ignoring Metra's chatter, Kaen turned to look at the fallen Angel. Those two girls know too much. It's dangerous. If it were the usual Kaen, and if those girls were ordinary people… he might have chosen to kill them without hesitation. But those girls are special. Not only did the Tower Lord and Metra personally instruct not to touch them… they were born with 'destiny.'

"Let's go back."

"Huh? Already? I'm tired…"

Hyeijin grumbled, but Kaen, seemingly unconcerned, disappeared into the air with light steps.

"Sigh, my fate. I partnered with the wrong person and went through all this trouble…"

She glanced regretfully at the spot where Baek Yuseol had fallen, shook her head, and cleared her mind. It was a pity she couldn't meet and talk to the witch directly… but discovering that witches exist in the world was a significant gain.

"Well, good things are good."

Hyeijin smiled brightly and followed Kaen, disappearing into the air.

"Ugh…"

Now, only the exhausted and drained Angel remained.

* * *

It was a dark, damp, yet cozy space. The entire space was filled with green fireflies, and a full moon, larger than Earth's, greeted me through the open sky. The path of the Milky Way, stretching to the end of the world and seemingly connected to another world, beautifully illuminated the flower field. The space, filled with light and mystery, was full of warmth and happiness, and in the midst of it… there was a woman.

"Come to me…"

She beckoned to me. Her name, more radiant than the moonlight and more sparkling than the Milky Way, was… Iphanel.

Huh? As soon as I recognized her, the colors of the world suddenly reversed. No, to be precise, the world… turned black. The flower field withered. The sky died. The garden was painted black. And Iphanel, writhing in agony, shrouded in black energy.

"Come to me…"

I instantly woke up.

"Gasp!"

I fumbled for my chest and touched my head, feeling my hair warmed by the sunlight. My muscles cramped as I hastily straightened my back. Holding my throbbing head and bowing quietly, a nurse entered with a click.

"Oh, you're awake."

Perhaps feeling guilty for not knocking, she made an apologetic face and went somewhere, asking me to wait a moment.

"Was it a hospital?"

For some reason, it was hard to think clearly due to the headache that had been bothering me since I woke up. It felt like there was a hole in my chest. Or something was stiflingly blocked.

"Iphanel… Was her turning black in the dream just a dream, or is it happening now?"

I became anxious.

"Do I need to go immediately…?"

As my mind raced, cold sweat flowed, and my heart began to pound. Just then, the door opened again, and someone entered. I thought it was a doctor, but the voice was familiar.

"Commoner. You don't look well."

…It was Princess Hong Biyeon. When I barely managed to meet her eyes, she, with her usual sullen expression, slightly furrowed her face.

"Did something happen to you?"

"No, nothing happened."

"…Then that's good."

Perhaps as a get-well gift, she placed a very realistic and inefficiently common fruit basket on the desk and approached me.

"You hunted the witch, didn't you?"

"…Is that so?"

In the end, we won, so yes, we did hunt her. If Flame hadn't helped at the last moment, I would have been trapped in that hellish world, writhing in agony and endless despair…

"Commoner."

"Huh? Yes."

She, who had been staring at me silently, suddenly approached and grabbed my chin, lifting it. Then, she stared into my eyes from a distance close enough to feel her breath. Still… in her red eyes, full of dissatisfaction, my haggard appearance was reflected.

"Ah…"

Even though I had just woken up, did I always look like this? Could this appearance be explained with just the excuse of having just woken up? After a while, Hong Biyeon, who had let go of my chin, took a few steps back and spoke.

"You did something great again this time. I don't know what you went through, but shake it off quickly."

She said that and left the hospital room, leaving me alone to stare blankly at the white-painted wall.

"What happened?"

Nothing happened. This time, no one died, and no one was injured. I also came out unscathed. But somehow, it felt like my heart was wounded. I didn't know why.

"Because I witnessed despair?"

For the first time in my life, I experienced a situation so dark that I couldn't see the way forward. Really, this had never happened before. So I lost, despaired, and tried to give up. Because I was… just an ordinary person. A person who couldn't even use magic. Negative emotions, including depression, anxiety, and despair, kept creeping up in my heart.

"Did I try to save the world?"

As soon as such thoughts crossed my mind.

Slap!

I slapped my cheek. This was… a habit. During my school days on Earth, when I had lost everything and could no longer dream, I made a promise to myself.

"Look at the world positively."

At that time, I was already in a desperate situation with no hope in sight… but I thought that if I let my thoughts become negative, I really wouldn't be able to do anything. So I straightened my mind, will, and thoughts firmly. But what about now? Isn't my mental state even more tattered than back then? Even with the blessing of Yeonhongchunsamwol…

"Huh?"

Wait. Something's strange. Suddenly, all the negative and positive emotions disappeared. As if they were implanted emotions. I tried to think as calmly as possible.

"Why am I like this despite having the blessing of Yeonhongchunsamwol?"

Even in the final moments of the battle with the witch. I gave up, despaired, and tried to submit to the witch. Was that… really me? Even before I had the blessing of Yeonhongchunsamwol, I had never given up. Yes, it's a great blessing, but… I can confidently say that my mental strength is already great. I just added another layer of iron armor called Yeonhongchunsamwol.

"What is this?"

A strange feeling as if my mind is empty and my emotions are being shaken. I immediately opened my status and checked the skill window, but there was no problem with the blessing of Yeonhongchunsamwol. Something was trying to seep into my mind again, but I could block it by closing my eyes and concentrating.

"There's a problem."

I was sure. This wasn't a problem with me. It was a problem with Iphanel, who was connected to my mind, or Yeonhongchunsamwol, or Flowerseorin. One of the three had a problem. This wasn't in the original episode, but I could think calmly without panicking. I could think about the possibility and cause.

"Ordinary person?"

I kept trying to belittle myself as an ordinary person, but that was wrong. I was… the only player who saw the end of Aether World Online, so I could have pride as the greatest among ordinary people.

"I need to check it myself."

No one would say anything if I missed a few classes after the witch incident. I immediately got out of bed, changed into my Stella uniform, and left the hospital room. If I had a bad feeling, I just had to find out and solve it myself. Thinking that, I opened the door of the hospital room.

"Huh?"

As soon as I opened the door, I met eyes with someone standing there. It was the head of the Stella Knights, Arain. He looked at me with cold eyes, but there was one question that came to mind first.

"What are you doing here…?"

If he came for a visit, he should have knocked. What was he doing standing here awkwardly? Arain was silent for a while, then finally spoke.

"I was going to. I just couldn't find the right moment."

"…Oh. Okay."

Anyway, he's a peculiar person.

"Let's have a talk."

Arain said that and entered the hospital room, so I had no choice but to return. Urgent matters aside, the post-processing of the previous incident was also important.
