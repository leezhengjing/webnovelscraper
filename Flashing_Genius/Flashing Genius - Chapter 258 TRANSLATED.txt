# I Became a Genius in Front of the Magic School 258

## 50. Noble Soul (8)

Meanwhile, at the point where the president of the Magic Society, Aryumun, and the elder of Namuhwa Lan, Suhaksan, met. A small clearing at the end of the World Tree. Chirp! Chirp! Sparrows chirped, and the leaves rustled gently in this clearing, which was so secluded that people rarely found it.

“Ugh...”

In a secluded corner of such a clearing, someone lay sprawled on an old, worn-out bench, completely drunk. Covered with just a single sheet of newspaper, the figure was in a daze, looking quite pitiful.

“Mister.”

It seemed that someone had found this place, as a girl with pointed ears passed by and couldn't just leave him alone.

“Ugh...”

But there was no answer.

“Mister!”

“Ugh!”

When the girl shouted again, the newspaper fell to the ground, revealing the man's face. His patchy beard, like pepper sprinkled here and there, and his curly, tangled hair gave him the typical appearance of a bum. His round ears indicated he was human, and his shabby clothes proved he was a beggar.

“What...”

He scratched his head with dark circles under his eyes and sat up. The girl pinched her nose and stepped back.

“Ugh, you smell like alcohol...”

“Hmm. Who are you?”

“And who are you, mister?”

“Me? I am...”

The man raised his hand. It was still covered in a blue-stained liquid.

“What is that?”

“Blood...”

“Blood? Blood is red.”

“For you elves, maybe.”

“Humans have red blood too. You're human, aren't you?”

“Me? Do I look human?”

When the girl nodded, the man burst into laughter. Did this innocent girl know that the blue blood on his hand was actually the blood of a mad black magician who had been slaughtering virgins for over ten years?

‘Well... he deserved to die.’

His name was Cheoliban, the Black Magician Slayer. Although Cheoliban was a black magician, he was on the run from other black magicians. Was it because he was the Black Magician Slayer? No, that was just a hobby. It was natural for weak black magicians to be weeded out, so it wasn't a big deal. However...

He had challenged the 'Black Magic King' a long time ago and lost, which is why he was currently a fugitive. A black magician who challenges the king cannot return alive. He had arrogantly aimed for the throne of the strong despite being weak, and the price for that was death. But he had shamefully fled, so it was only natural that he couldn't show his face and had to live in hiding.

“Hmm, it's quiet here.”

He was slightly tired from the fierce battle earlier, but fortunately, there were no pursuers here. He was tired of getting his hands bloody, so he wanted to rest for a while.

“It's always quiet here.”

“Well... that's not what I meant. But it is quiet. You don't have any friends, do you?”

When Cheoliban asked with a sly smile, the girl shouted back.

“I do have friends!”

“Who?”

“Chi... Chico...”

“Is that the name of your dog?”

“It's a cat!”

“Puhaha! A cat as a friend? You're a funny kid. Elves live for hundreds of years, but you'll be playing alone your whole life...”

Shiver-!

As Cheoliban was laughing and talking to the girl, his senses suddenly sharpened.

Crack!

At that moment, a huge stone wall rose from the ground, forming a dome around Cheoliban and the girl.

“Whoa?!”

As the sunlight was blocked, the girl fell to the ground in surprise.

“Did you do this, mister...?”

“Well... yes.”

It was indeed Cheoliban's ability, but it wasn't his will that caused it. The earth, sensing a threat, had acted on its own to protect him.

‘This is... Earth Projection.’

It was a very unique type of technique used by only a few magicians in Aither. It wasn't exactly magic, as it had no spells, but it wasn't not magic either, as it had calculations.

‘A projection that covers the entire World Tree.’

Cheoliban stretched his stiff neck as he withdrew the stone wall.

‘...It seems someone formidable has come, knowing I'm here.’

He had a good idea of who it was, and his eyes narrowed.

‘Aryumun Blushun. What a nuisance.’

The thought that the persistent magician had chased him all the way here made his head throb.

“Sigh, I really need a drink.”

Moreover, Aryumun wasn't the only problem he had to worry about.

‘Where is that guy...?’

He had chased a black magician all the way to the Namuhwa Lan orchard, but the signal had suddenly cut off, and he hadn't been able to find him for days. Given that he had stayed here for so long, it was only natural that a high-level pursuer like Aryumun would come.

He had never stayed in one place for more than a day in his decades of life as a fugitive.

“Hmm, I think I know where he is... but I wonder if I can fight him.”

Cheoliban looked up at the sky. The lush, green tree that covered the entire sky. The giant World Tree that pierced through even the clouds had a will of its own, making Cheoliban hesitant to act recklessly here.

‘It's unsettling that the World Tree is so quiet... but there's no harm in being cautious.’

“...Mister.”

“Hmm?”

When he lowered his gaze, the girl from earlier was looking up at him with curious eyes.

“Are you... loved by the earth?”

“What? What nonsense is that?”

“I've never seen a magician who controls the earth like you. I can hear it. The earth likes you. It moved on its own will.”

“Stop talking nonsense.”

“It's true.”

“Enough, get lost.”

“Huh?”

When Cheoliban waved his hand dismissively and started walking somewhere, the girl reached out in panic. Even though it was a clearing, it was still the trunk of the World Tree. If he took a wrong turn, he might fall.

“That's a cliff...!”

The girl shouted as she chased after him, but it was too late.

“Huh?”

She thought it was too late. But then, a thick pillar of earth was summoned from the tree trunk, creating a path for Cheoliban to walk on. The rough, twisted, dirt-colored pillar seemed to have been created by nature itself, not by human will.

“Wow...”

The girl watched Cheoliban's disappearing figure with sparkling eyes. If there really was a spirit of the earth... she imagined it would look like that.

* * *

After that day, I stayed in the garden of Yiphanell for three more days, and then I suddenly realized I had forgotten something. It was something very important yet trivial.

‘Attendance!’

Today was Monday. A school day. I was meditating in the garden of Yiphanell when I hurriedly ran out of the garden, and at that moment, a white owl circling the sky wobbled and flew into my head.

-Screech!

“Ugh!”

I screamed at the same time as the owl and grabbed its ankle as it struggled to fall to the ground.

“Ugh, my head...”

It was my first time seeing it in person, but I knew what it was.

‘Stella Safety Management System.’

If a Stella student goes out for a mission or other reasons and doesn't return, a magical owl follows the tracking device attached to the uniform. These owls are equipped with stealth magic and space-penetrating magic of at least 7th class, allowing them to move instantly over long distances and remain undetected in most situations.

The fact that I could see this owl... might be because my senses had become too sharp, but it could also be because this owl was just dumb.

-Coo... Coo...

The owl made a strange sound, lifted its head, and looked straight at me, speaking in a deep voice.

-Baek Yuseol! Student Baek Yuseol! You have not returned by Sunday without a special reason, so you will be penalized!

No, there's a reason for this...

-However! If you are currently in danger, press 111! If you are in a special situation where you cannot return, press 112!

“Where do I press?”

The owl spread its wings. Flap! There was a number pad, similar to a phone dial, attached there. After a moment of hesitation, I pressed the 112 dial, and with a click, the owl flew high into the sky and headed somewhere. It would probably return to Stella Academy and report that I couldn't return.

“...Is this okay?”

It's a good system, but it's still inconvenient. I hope Alterisha develops a convenient device like a cell phone soon.

‘...But for that, we might need to develop satellites or transmission towers first.’

Barely catching my breath, I sat down on the ground. Sigh... The blowing wind seemed to awaken every cell in my body. Just three days. Only three days had passed, but I felt like a completely different person from before.

I hadn't gained superhuman strength dramatically. But all my abilities had grown evenly, so I could feel proud.

‘This is the true value of Yeonhongchunsamwol.’

Thinking back, I was really stupid. In the game, I couldn't utilize the blessings of the Twelve Months, so I thought of them as just 'additional attribute effects.' The blessing of Cheongdongshiwol only increased resistance to ice attributes, and Yeonhongchunsamwol only increased mental power.

But... hadn't I felt it many times before? The blessing of Yeonhongchunsamwol, which I had received excessively, gave Kkotseorin the ability to charm everyone, and I also gained the ability to read others' minds by utilizing it.

I had been wasting the limitless potential of the Twelve Months' abilities.

‘...The first thing I need to utilize now is Eunsaeshibilwol.’

In the game, it was one of the most mysterious abilities, with no player ever reaching the highest level to unlock its true power. But it might not be that difficult for me. The game character could only grow through simple grinding, but I could feel and use it with my real body.

* Sensory increase by 40%
* Mental power increase by 12%
* Ability not unlocked.

‘Tick-tock, the flowing silver time.’

What a funny skill. Despite being the most special blessing among the Twelve Months, with the power of time, it only gave a slight increase in stats. In the original game, it was just such a blessing, so I didn't pay much attention to it. If I had thought a little deeper, I would have tried to unlock the hidden ability.

How? The question briefly crossed my mind, but it didn't seem as difficult as I thought. With the blessing of Yeonhongchunsamwol with me, self-reflection wasn't that hard.

‘...Just a little longer.’

Kkotseorin was probably discussing future plans with Elder Suhaksan by now. Since they found out the cause was Yiphanell, they might be preparing magic to purify this place. So what should I do?

‘Since I've already skipped school, one more day should be fine.’

There's a mysterious phenomenon where if you're about to be late for school, you feel rushed, but once you're already late, you feel more relaxed. That's exactly how I feel now. Maybe because I skipped a whole day, I feel like I've let go of everything.

So just one more day. Just one more day, I decided to stay in the garden of Yiphanell. Two days should be fine, right?
