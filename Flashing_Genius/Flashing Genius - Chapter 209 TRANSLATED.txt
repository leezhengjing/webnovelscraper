# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 209

## 46. Old Story (5)

After the disappearance of Melian, countless wizards tried to find his whereabouts by detecting mana flow or tracking his soul. Their methods were not wrong. The problem was that they couldn't keep up with the ancient technology of Karmenset. Therefore, the dungeon backtracking proposed by Baek Yuseol was not particularly creative, but it was quite groundbreaking. This was because this technology was scheduled to be developed five years in the future.

"How is this possible...?"

There was no trace left where Melian disappeared. Not even a trace of magic or Melian's soul. However, it was common sense that if a great will called 'wish' was involved, there would be some trace left. They just couldn't detect it.

"I feel a bit sorry for stealing the technology, but it can't be helped."

Baek Yuseol commanded the Black Search Team of the Full Moon Tower indifferently. To be precise, it was more of a request than a command.

"From now on, we don't need the Spirit Rate. If it's okay, could you switch to the beta version? I need to adjust the waves."

Even though he had taken over the command, he was still a student and had only been given temporary authority, so he was as polite as possible. The Black Team did not refuse his request. At first, they didn't believe Baek Yuseol's words, but at this point, he was the only wizard showing results. They might have followed even if it was a command rather than a request.

"...It seems to be progressing smoothly."

Haeseongwol, the master of the Full Moon Tower, was watching the scene from a distance without missing a moment.

"An unusual child."

Stella cadet Baek Yuseol. Stories about him had been continuously heard since the beginning of the year. Even excluding the trivial stories that happened within the school, his actions so far were too peculiar. In the distant past, he walked a path similar to the great wizards who left a mark in history. As a fellow wizard, he even felt a slight sense of respect. Before long, the existence of Baek Yuseol would undoubtedly rise to the ranks of great wizards like himself.

But...

That was a separate matter.

"He's too outstanding."

It was bizarre. In every incident, Baek Yuseol always came up with the right answer. Haeseongwol, who was quick with information, was well aware of the recent incident at the coast of Levian.

"The one who took down the Pirate King Black Belize in one blow... was actually Baek Yuseol."

Indeed, it was true that legendary wizards in history left great marks and departed. But no one had shown such a unique path as Baek Yuseol.

"That child is like..."

Following the countless streams of knowledge swirling in his mind, Haeseongwol suddenly thought of a certain possibility and quickly came to his senses.

"...What am I thinking?"

Maybe it was because he read too many fantasy magic novels as a child, but whenever he faced something impossible, he kept thinking of impossible possibilities. Thanks to that, he made numerous discoveries and realizations, reaching his current position, but this was not it.

While Haeseongwol was shaking his head, trying to erase the absurd possibility from his mind, he heard someone's scream.

"Uwaaaaaa!!"

"I-I found it! I found it!"

It was not a scream, but a cheer.

"What? Really?"

"Already found it?"

At the place where Melian disappeared, not only the wizards of the Full Moon Tower but also wizards from other affiliations were gathered, and all their eyes were focused.

"What?"

The news was surprising and even chilling to Haeseongwol. He thought he should ask something and slowly moved his steps, but someone passed by him first. It was Jelliel.

"Ah...!"

She hurriedly ran and looked at the strange machine Baek Yuseol was operating, then collapsed to the ground. Seeing some bodyguards of Starcloud quickly approaching to support her, Haeseongwol decided to step back for a moment. He could figure out the true nature of the constant sense of incongruity he felt from Baek Yuseol later.

Loss.

The experience of losing something familiar is not pleasant for anyone. Whether it's a lover or family who was always with you, or the legs that allowed you to walk freely, or the arms that made daily life convenient.

Loss is part of our daily life, and we can feel it at any time. Therefore, the thrill of finding something lost is indescribable.

"Haa..."

On a certain mountain peak, above a certain cloud, Eunsesibilwol took a deep breath and opened his eyes. The silver light passed through his eyes.

"...Good."

The fullness of regaining a part of time after a long time could not be expressed in the clumsy language created by humans.

"Now I can see... If I were to describe this feeling in human terms... it would be like regaining lost sight."

The future, branching out in countless directions, was now clearly visible. He didn't miss even the smallest variables.

And.

"...Hmm?"

Something strange was detected in the 'future,' causing Eunsesibilwol's expression to harden.

"This is... Ugh!"

Perhaps because he foresaw too many futures while still not having regained the power of the past, a tremendous headache struck him. It was difficult to exert his full power unless the past, present, and future were balanced. He hurriedly got up and headed to the cabin built on the cloud. He found an old magnifying glass in the drawer of the cabin filled with the smell of wood and tried to look into the future again, but...

"...Who is outside?"

He couldn't do it because he detected an unpleasant aura outside the cabin. Eunsesibilwol put his hands behind his back and slowly came out of the cabin. There, a human woman and a dwarf youth were kneeling and bowing their heads towards Eunsesibilwol. They might seem like ordinary humans and dwarves at first glance, but they couldn't deceive Eunsesibilwol's eyes. They were dark magicians, and not just any dark magicians, but the highest-ranking ones.

"The last clan of Costalin and the filthy cannibals."

Their names were Azmic Costalin and Calavan. They were the ones who swore loyalty to the legendary dark magician Blackkingdon, who single-handedly destroyed the Valkamic royal family. It was not a common sight for them to kneel to someone else. However, it was natural for even dark magicians to respect the Twelve New Moons. In fact, dark magicians respected the Twelve New Moons even more than wizards. They believed that those who handled the twelve elements would lead them to salvation.

"How did you find this place?"

Eunsesibilwol treated the dark magicians in front of him no differently than he treated Baek Yuseol. Azmic of the Costalin clan slightly raised his head and spoke.

"We felt your aura while passing by and came to find you."

Usually, he lived hiding his aura thoroughly, but when absorbing the power of the 'divine object,' he couldn't prevent it from leaking out. It couldn't be helped. He had expected someone to come. It was fortunate that 'Sakwol Tower Master Ludrick' didn't come.

"I see. The reason you were passing by... must be because of Baek Yuseol."

Azmic and Calavan had previously been tasked with hunting Baek Yuseol but failed. Did they hold a grudge? No, that wasn't it. Rather... it was curiosity. Everyone was paying attention to that boy, who was just a first-year cadet at Stella. From the Sakwol Tower Master and the principal of Stella to even Black Kingdon. And now, even the Twelve New Moons, Eunsesibilwol, were watching that boy.

"I want to ask you something."

"Speak."

"That boy... what is his true identity?"

Eunsesibilwol burst into laughter.

"I can't answer that."

Azmic bowed his head. He thought there was a secret he didn't know and shouldn't know, so he wasn't being told. But it was the opposite.

"I don't know either."

Eunsesibilwol closed his eyes and looked into the future for a moment. The events that would happen in the future stretched out like a panorama. And in every moment of that future, Baek Yuseol existed. It was an unbelievable story. In the future, countless events would occur. When a great disaster threatened the safety of the world, when a demon sealed in hell awakened and lifted an entire continent, when the heavenly realm, which had disappeared, reappeared in the world, when the legendary ruins submerged in the sea emerged. In every significant event in the world, Baek Yuseol was involved.

"Why does he go to such lengths?"

He was so self-sacrificing that it was hard to understand. If he had lived through countless times, he should have learned to give up by now. Like himself. But he hadn't learned to give up. Or maybe he had learned but forgot as soon as he started the next life.

"Shinwol."

"Speak."

"...The request from that time is still valid. We are still waiting for you."

The request from that time. It was over 50 years ago, so his memory was vague. He hadn't paid attention to it in the first place.

"Are you talking about the request from your leader?"

"Not the leader, the king."

"Yes, the dark leader."

Who else could dare to call the Dark King such a vulgar term? Despite their king being insulted, the two dark magicians bowed their heads.

"Tell him to stop talking nonsense. Your 'paradise' is a lie. I have no intention of helping with a misguided choice."

Then.

"No."

With a voice completely different from before, Azmic spoke, exuding a chilling aura.

"You are wrong, and we are right. The 'paradise' that will save all life in this world was right there! How could you not notice it when you were the closest to paradise?"

"Haha."

Feeling like he was watching a child's antics, Eunsesibilwol just laughed. He knew it was useless to explain. There was nothing more foolish than arguing with a fool.

"Go back."

"...You will regret it. When the time comes, it will be too late."

After Azmic and Calavan disappeared, Eunsesibilwol walked slowly and sat in front of the Go board. The game he had been playing with someone until just now was... unfinished. He picked up a stone.

Plop!

He placed a white stone, then a black stone. There is no Go game that doesn't end. There are only unfinished games. Then, he looked up and stared at the empty space.

"This is...!"

He suddenly sensed the aura of 'time reversal,' which only he could feel in this universe. He quickly realized what was happening and who was causing it. The 'divine object of the past,' which had branched off from him, gained will, and was hiding somewhere in the world, had started to act again. The rewound clock... was about 10 years. It wasn't a long time.

"...That wretched woman is playing tricks again."

Plop!

He placed a white stone. He felt someone slowly taking a step forward to meet their sad fate. Unfortunately... there was nothing a powerless old man who couldn't interfere with time could do. He just waited quietly.

Plop!

The old man played Go silently. In the pavilion above the clouds, filled with silence, only the sound of Go stones clashing echoed.
