# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 255

## 50. Noble Soul (8)

"I'm sorry. The application period has already ended. If you give up your player qualification here, you will receive a significant penalty... Are you okay with that?"

It was a statement that plunged Flame into despair. She couldn't give up her qualification as a player in the League of Spirits. Forced to participate due to Jeremy's scheming, she couldn't even choose her team freely.

"What? I can't even change my team? Why?"

"Well... When you apply, you have to decide your affiliation in advance. Miss Flame is definitely affiliated with the 'Scalven Team.'"

"No, I don't want that."

"Pardon?"

Though it was childish to be unreasonable, Flame was in no position to care about appearances.

"Please. Sister, can't you change my team somehow, as if you're saving a person's life?"

"Well... All the other teams have already confirmed their five players."

"But there might be a way. Please. I'm begging you."

As Flame clasped her hands tightly and sent a desperate look, the League of Spirits player manager felt her heart thump.

'So cute...'

Usually, her personality was so fierce and dog-like that it was a problem, but when she made a calm expression, she was this cute.

"Ahem, then let's do this."

The manager composed herself and cleared her throat. It wasn't right to be swayed by a single student, but with such a desperate plea, how could she not grant at least one request?

"There will be an additional selection tournament soon. Gather four players from there and form a team. Then, it might be possible to transfer teams."

"Really?"

"Honestly, I'd like to make the team for you, but that's beyond my authority. Can you gather four people?"

Flame nodded vigorously at her words. She had no idea how to gather four people immediately, but it was a million times better than participating with Jeremy as part of Scalven.

Flame clasped the manager's hands tightly and sent a sparkling look.

"Thank you! I will never forget this favor!"

"...I don't think I'll ever forget this scene either."

If it had been another student's request, it might have been a bothersome additional task, but for Flame, she could compose herself because she had received a definite reward. In fact, thanks to that reward, it felt like all her fatigue had been washed away, so it could be seen as a gain.

"Make sure to gather four people."

"Yes!"

Watching Flame run off excitedly like a child, the manager sighed deeply.

"By the way... Most of the additional applicants already have affiliations. Can she really gather them...?"

Though she was quite worried, there was nothing more she could do, so she decided to watch quietly. After all, with Flame's level of popularity, gathering four people should be a piece of cake.

"...Right?"

### Evening After Class

When students who didn't live in the dormitory went home, Mayuseong would occasionally go for a walk to Arcanium with them. While the goal was to strengthen relationships with friends, the most important thing was to secretly communicate with the outside world.

Meeting his contact within Stella was dangerous. No matter how perfect his disguise as a black mage was, as long as Stella's vice principal, Akihayden, was watching, he had to be cautious.

Akihayden was a servant of the Black Mage King, but he was far from loyal. Since it was impossible to know what schemes he might be plotting with his insidious mind, it was best to move quietly, avoiding his gaze.

"Raven. Are you there?"

When Mayuseong spoke into the empty alley, a shadow split, revealing a figure in a black robe.

"You called, Your Highness."

"I want to deliver this to my father. Is it possible?"

"Of course. If it's Your Highness's command, anything is possible."

Raven took Mayuseong's letter, feeling puzzled. Was the mature prince the type to write letters to his father? If anything, he would avoid conversation, making this a truly strange occurrence. But it was not his place to question. He was a loyal servant, meant to follow orders.

"Oh, did you find out what I asked last time?"

When Mayuseong asked, Raven swallowed hard. The young prince wanted only one piece of information: to find the Earth Contractor, Cheolribeon. Rumor had it that he had made a contract with one of the Twelve Zodiac, Damgaltwoiwol, and gained an invincible body, but no one knew for sure. Since the day the rumor spread, he had completely hidden his presence.

"For now... I found him."

"And?"

"Yes. Recently, he was briefly spotted at the Frostfall Garrison... but by the time our agent arrived, everyone at the scene had been killed."

"Hmm. That's unfortunate."

Mayuseong frowned slightly. Cheolribeon must have realized someone was tracking him but couldn't pinpoint the exact location of the agent. He didn't have such keen senses. So, he chose to kill everyone at the scene to leave no loose ends.

"Still as ruthless as ever."

"All traces were completely erased, making further pursuit impossible."

"Take a break for now. If another massacre happens, it will be tiring for both of us."

Despite saying that, Mayuseong couldn't hide his disappointment. Cheolribeon. If that man could help him achieve what he wanted... Why was he living in hiding, giving up on everything without even trying? With such power, was there a need to hide?

Mayuseong couldn't understand at all.

"Oh, and recently, there have been suspicious movements at the Black Tower. They seem to be preparing for the 'Black Night Succession Ceremony.'"

"Hmm..."

In the world of black mages, the strong ruled. It was a society where the strong trampled the weak to rise. The Black Mage King became the 'king' because he possessed the most powerful strength and had held that position firmly for decades without any intention of stepping down.

How many black mages had challenged him and shed tears of blood since he took power? Now, everyone knew. The Black Mage King was undoubtedly the strongest, and his rule had to be acknowledged.

But... there was one problem. Rumors had spread that the Black Mage King was once part of the 'Light Mage Corps.' Though it no longer existed, that special organization created by Stella Academy was designed to exterminate black mages and had driven them into hiding for a terrifying year.

A mage from the Light Mage Corps now ruling as a fallen black mage king? Though he was the strongest, he couldn't be accepted as a king. Riding on that public opinion, the black mage alliance's underworld was plotting to overthrow the Black Mage King.

"Such pointless actions."

Mayuseong laughed emotionlessly. Though he deeply despised his father, he knew one thing. His father's power was beyond what could be handled with mere tricks. That's why Mayuseong was desperately searching for Cheolribeon. He was the only black mage who had survived a confrontation with his father.

"A black mage blessed by the Twelve Zodiac... Such a unique case must be one of a kind in the world."

"Have you confirmed his last known destination?"

When asked with a sense of regret, Raven nodded reluctantly.

"Yes. Though the tracking magic was cut off, predicting his route was easy. He's a simple man..."

"Really?"

"Most likely, he is heading to the orchard of the Third World Tree, Namuhwaran. It's the only major city in that area."

"It's best not to provoke the elves. He won't cause trouble, will he?"

"Probably not. If he angers the World Tree and the Elf King, even Cheolribeon will struggle."

"Then I'm relieved. He's not a man without foresight."

Mayuseong smiled and said, "Good job. You can go back now. It's not good to be exposed for too long."

"Thank you for your consideration, Your Highness."

Raven left a short bow and disappeared back into the shadows, while Mayuseong looked up at the increasingly darkening sky.

"The sky is dark today..."

It was a particularly cloudy day.

* * *

Bang!

"What! Why are you telling me this now!"

Magic Society, Central Sky Tower. The Star of Valliereki. In the conference room where over a hundred grand mages who had published at least seven-class spells gathered, Vice President Kaladen shouted.

"The Frostfall Garrison was annihilated...?"

The Frostfall Garrison, formed to exterminate the beasts inhabiting the Frostfall Plateau, was composed of veteran magic warriors and boasted an impenetrable defense. It had been deemed impossible to exterminate the beasts for ten years, so they had focused on preventing invasions. But now, annihilation?

"...Calm down, Kaladen."

The vice president was about to shout again, but a calm voice from behind made him close his mouth and turn around. The head of the Sky Tower and the head of the Mage Union, a young man in his twenties named Aryumun, was over 150 years old. Kaladen's excitement over this situation was rather annoying to him.

"Explain step by step. Did an unexpected high-level beast appear?"

"No... That's not it. After sending a search party to investigate, there were no signs of a battle with beasts."

"Then, it must be a black mage?"

"Yes... It seems to be a black mage who uses magic."

"Hmm."

Black mages who use magic are rare. Most lose their intelligence or mana upon becoming black mages, making it impossible to use magic. However, some black mages use their 'traits' and racial inheritance abilities to use magic, making them the most dangerous and troublesome type.

"The target seems to use earth-based magic. Though not particularly cautious, all traces on the ground were completely erased."

"Really?"

A black mage who could single-handedly destroy the Frostfall Garrison and used earth-based magic. Only one person came to mind.

"After ten years, you show yourself again, Cheolribeon."

But why now? After living quietly, why suddenly become active? Did someone provoke him? Was there a need? Many questions arose, but the immediate thought was...

"...It seems the Black Night Succession Ceremony is about to begin. They must be planning to make him the new king. After all, he is a pure-blood black mage."

"A pure-blood black mage...?"

It seemed like a foreign term to the other mages, who expressed their curiosity. To mages, a black mage was just a black mage, so distinguishing their lineage was unfamiliar.

"Yes. They're strange... They even divide themselves by origin. They're not like humans..."

Aryumun joked in a soft tone, causing the mages to hesitate, unsure how to react. Finding their foolish reactions amusing, Aryumun chuckled and shook his head.

"Have you confirmed his location?"

"Though the pursuit was cut off, the only place he could go from there was one."

"Then..."

"Yes. The orchard of the Third World Tree, Namuhwaran."

"Hoo..."

Of all places, why would that rampaging locomotive head to the peaceful city of elves?

"I hope he stays quiet there... For now, discreetly send the 'Black Mage Extermination Squad.'"

"Understood."

The elite group with the best black mage response capabilities, the Black Mage Extermination Squad, might reduce some damage. But the best outcome would be for Cheolribeon to move to another area without causing any trouble.

"Another troublesome matter... Why do so many tiring things happen in my old age?"

Aryumun sighed deeply.

"Tell them I'll go myself."

"Y-You, the president, will go personally...?"

"Yes. No need for long explanations."

He said that and stood up. Though he was old, sick, and tired, he still had to do his duty.
