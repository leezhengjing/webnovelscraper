### Chapter 172: The Seventh Tower (3)

The sub-event in Malentires proceeded smoothly. Step by step, following the predetermined future, Feng Liuzhen reached the final destination quickly. Finally, he learned the whole truth.

"Ah, Liuzhen..."

Looking at the woman who had collapsed on the ground, crying, Feng Liuzhen stared at his own hands. Through his translucent hands, he could see the pattern engraved on the floor. For some reason, his reflection did not appear in the mirror.

"Ah..."

At that moment, his memories returned. The fact that he was dead. The reason he died, and the woman he loved, who was now sitting in front of him, crying. He remembered everything.

"I... am already dead..."

Even in death, unable to rest in peace, Feng Liuzhen wandered the netherworld, hunting ghosts to protect his beloved. He finally realized that all these events originated from him. He approached the woman and whispered quietly.

"Go and give him a hug."

"Ah..."

Despite her tears, she stood up and approached the ghostly Feng Liuzhen. They embraced warmly and exchanged words of love. As time passed, Feng Liuzhen's body became more transparent, and when the woman finally confessed, "I loved you," he ascended and disappeared into light.

"Ah..."

And so, the story ended. Leaving the sobbing woman behind, I stepped outside the mansion and leaned against the wall. In the world of Aether, there are countless 'sub-events.' Each event has a protagonist at its center, and the player jumps into the causal relationship to help resolve the incident.

However...

It's impossible to jump into every sub-event. Even at this moment, incidents and accidents are happening all over the world, and as a player, I called them 'events,' but they were real stories. Experiencing it firsthand made it even more real. I realized how insignificant my influence on this world was. I thought the stories of the protagonists at Stella Academy were the most important, but outside the small school's boundaries, countless stories sparkled like stars.

"Sigh..."

I picked up Feng Liuzhen's pipe. A drop of water fell on it. Drip! Drip! Suddenly, a downpour started. It's not unusual for it to rain in summer, but the timing felt peculiar. Come to think of it, didn't it rain after events in the game too? I didn't bring an umbrella. Unlike other mages, I couldn't deploy a mana shield, so I had no choice but to get soaked. I took out Stella's coat, modified with Alterisha's technology, and put it on. It was somewhat waterproof. I walked the streets of Malentires one last time. With the powerful ghostly aura of Feng Liuzhen gone, the atmosphere of the town felt much clearer, despite the overcast weather.

Ah, right. The final line of this event was that. I fiddled with the rain-soaked pipe. Feng Liuzhen always told me. He would retire after this. He said he would spend the rest of his life farming in a small hut in the countryside. I didn't respond. I knew it was an unattainable dream. In the end, he was destined to leave, leaving only this pipe behind.

...And this pipe was the 'Spirit's Soul Talisman,' which would be very helpful in the episode [Demonic Erosion]. The artifact 'Resentful Branch' I used on Meizen Tiren was useful for offensive purposes in boss battles, but the Spirit's Soul Talisman would be a great help for survival throughout the episode.

"It's best if I don't have to use this... Anyway, I have insurance, so I'm relieved. Next, I'll head to the 'villa' Feng Liuzhen always mentioned, clear the hidden dungeon buried in the ruins, and return to Stella. The dungeon has no monsters, just quizzes and traps to clear, and there's a strategy guide, so it should be very easy."

"...Shall we go?"

Crossing the deserted, rain-soaked streets, I quickly moved my steps.

Talking to a mirror is not a pleasant feeling. It might even evoke a creepy, mad atmosphere. However, for dark mages, talking to a mirror is not that strange or unusual. The world inside the mirror is completely reversed. Right is left. Left is right. A completely opposite world. So, for dark mages, the mirror was a gateway to the 'reverse world.'

In a dark hall. There was no one, and nothing, except for a full-length mirror. Professor Raiden spoke to the mirror.

"...The Star Child is heading there now."

Professor Raiden's reflection did not appear in the mirror. Naturally. It was a world different from reality. The mirror did not respond immediately but then spoke to Raiden.

– You are... a useful errand boy.

"Is that so."

– Yes. Along with the Star Child, you sent the descendants of the other twelve disciples...

The voice's owner seemed quite pleased.

"What do you plan to do with that child?"

– I will devour them. Naturally.

...But, you will fail.

For the first time, the voice's owner spoke negatively.

– I am merely a fragment of a shattered soul, so I cannot absorb the Star Child...

A shattered soul. Truly a sorrowful term.

"Then why make such a choice?"

– Even if I absorb a part of that child to suppress it, they will not awaken the abilities of their 'previous life.'

The voice fell silent for a moment. It seemed to be deep in thought.

* * *

"You plan to die yourself."

– ...Though I will perish here, the true 'me' still lives. Under the name of the king.

"Indeed."

– That is enough.

Professor Raiden closed his eyes. The being in the mirror could not even maintain its form, nor did it have any memories of its past life. It was merely a fragment of someone's soul, a counterfeit. But despite that, the clear will it had in life remained steadfast, continuing even after half a century. It spoke unwaveringly.

– Remember. Constellatio does not wish for the world's destruction.

"...Yes. I know."

– To correct the wrong choice of the progenitor mage, this is an unavoidable choice...

The conversation ended there. The presence in the mirror completely disappeared. Now, only Professor Raiden, with a complicated expression, stood in front of the mirror. He stared at the mirror for a long time, then turned and left the hall. And shortly after...

...Crash!!

The mirror shattered into countless pieces and scattered into dust. It would never reflect anything again.

* * *

"Isn't this the right way?"

"No. It's this way."

"I think it's the other way."

People often use the phrase 'possessed by a ghost.' But how many of those who use it have actually been possessed by a ghost? Even geniuses like Flame and Angel, and even Anella, who lived as a dark mage, had never been possessed by a ghost. So, while following the ghost story, no one knew exactly where or how to go.

Whoosh...

A cold wind brushed past their ears.

– Heehee...!

– Hahaha...!

Somewhere, the laughter of children echoed like a reverberation. At the same time, the girls stopped walking. They didn't say anything, but they held each other's hands tightly and walked. No matter how brave the girls were, ghosts were scary.

'Cute...'

Jeremy, who was following a few steps behind, felt a certain thirst looking at Flame. A thirst born of possessiveness. He knew the pleasure of 'conquest.' The thrill that comes when you obtain something you can't have or is hard to get. Those who haven't felt it can never understand. Jeremy even felt a kind of competitive spirit towards Flame. He wondered how it would feel to make her body and heart, which always rejected him, completely his own. Having never experienced such a situation before, Jeremy felt a strange excitement.

'Hmm...'

However, recently, a rather annoying group had appeared at the school. It wasn't just about Baek Yuseol. Jeremy was curious about Flame's every move, wanting to know everything she did and where she went, so he had his minions watch her from afar. Recently, he noticed some movements that bothered him. There were others besides him watching Flame from a distance. Those watching Flame were diverse, from old janitors to lab managers and even faculty members, with no commonality to be found. But he could tell they didn't look at Flame with kind eyes. He didn't like it. To be honest, it made him feel bad. The idea that other insignificant beings were targeting his chosen prey was ridiculous and absurd. But regardless of his feelings, Jeremy analyzed the situation calmly.

'The reason they are watching Flame.'

Recently, she had been investigating ghost stories around the school. Was that the reason? No, there were many students like that. Even the 'Mystery Club,' which was quite large at Stella, caused a lot of commotion trying to uncover the ghost story of the Seventh Tower. But... Flame was investigating in a slightly different way. Instead of uncovering the ghost story itself, she was looking for the person who spread the ghost story. It was a fact Jeremy easily found out, so the faculty must have noticed too. They must have been quite bothered by Flame's investigation.

'So they watched Flame?'

There was no need to watch her for that reason. It would be a noticeable action. So, he had to think the opposite. They intended to use Flame, who was digging into their secrets. '...They want to involve Flame in the ghost story.' This was the conclusion Jeremy reached. So he followed her secretly when she left the dormitory at dawn and came here. He wouldn't let anyone else protect Flame. This time, he would do it himself.

"...Huh?"

"What... is this..."

The girls walking ahead suddenly stopped. No one noticed, but the surroundings had changed. "Wait. Did we really come in? Really?" "Yes. From now on, it could be really dangerous, so let's be careful." "I'll go first."

While the girls made a fuss, Jeremy quietly looked out the window. The black moon shone down on the world, and the sky was entirely white. It was late dawn just before they entered. Not only that, but everything outside the window was completely reversed in color. As if to make it clear that this was another world.

'...Beautiful.'

A reversed world. Jeremy found it quite beautiful. If possible, he wanted to take this world and display it. But more than that, the movements that kept bothering him prevented him from fully enjoying the scenery. The walls rippled, and the corridor swayed. The space itself moved slowly, pressing in as if it had flexibility. Jeremy realized. This place was already within the range of an unknown enemy's design. Any resistance would be meaningless. But to protect Flame, he was willing to do anything.

Swoosh.

Golden blades rose from the floor, spinning around Jeremy's body, protecting him. The gold climbed the walls, slowly devouring the black that covered the corridor. Bit by bit. It devoured the black.

'...Weak.'

It was still not enough. Jeremy objectively assessed his level. At best, he was at the 4th class level. Still far too weak compared to the magic skills of his 'brothers.' But the reason he survived after killing all his brothers was not because of his magic skills.

'Cruelty.'

No matter what was in front of him, he could cut it down without hesitation. Shadows flickered and rose before him. They slowly encroached on the space, heading towards Flame and the girls. Slash! The golden blade cut through the air, splitting the shadow in half and collapsing it.

'...Manageable.'

Jeremy drew more mana, summoning more golden blades and walls. He had studied a lot to win the heart of a girl for the first time in his life, and he realized one thing.

'Women fall for reliable men who can protect them.'

It was a common theme in most romance books, so it must be true. And Jeremy had the power and authority to protect someone. Even here, it would be no different.

...So he thought.

Flash!

Suddenly, the world turned white. Jeremy instinctively closed his eyes, then quickly summoned a golden shield. But when he opened his eyes again... all the shadows had already melted into dust. The light still spread vividly around, and at its center stood a girl, Flame. She spun her staff high and struck it on the ground.

"Is everyone okay?"

"Yes, yes..."

"Amazing..."

"Good. Let's go again."

Flame glanced at Jeremy's position to check if he was safe, then turned and led the way. Watching her walk confidently, Jeremy felt a subtle emotion. She had melted all those dark masses with a single spell, something he couldn't even cut through in one go. Was it possible for a first-year student to use such magic? No. A fundamental question arose.

'Can I really protect her?'

Not because he was weak. The girl was too strong... so there was no need to protect her.

"Haha..."

He laughed for the first time in a while. Someone might think he was laughing out of frustration, but no. He laughed because he was happy. It was a new experience, something he had never felt before.

'Interesting, fun... and attractive.'

Flame, who always showed more than Jeremy imagined... The more he saw her, the more he wanted her.
