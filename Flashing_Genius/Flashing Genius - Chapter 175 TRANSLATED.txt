# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 175

## 40. The Seventh Tower (6)

The schedule outside of Stella was finally over. I had found a solution to the curse of the Flower Frost, discovered the existence of the Divine Artifact, obtained an artifact in Malentires that would greatly aid in the Black Magic Erosion, and successfully retrieved the Divine Artifact by exploring the ruins at Fengliu Jin's residence.

I wanted to return to Flower Frost immediately to lift the curse, but I had no choice but to return to Stella as the introduction of the Black Magic Erosion was in full swing. I planned to boast about the 'Soul Talisman of the Dead' to Flame right away. With this, I would be very confident in the Seventh Tower where the Black Magic Erosion episode was taking place.

However, upon arrival, I realized something was amiss.

"Flame...? Come to think of it, he said he was going to find out about the ghost story himself... Where did he go?"

"What the hell?"

I sensed that the situation was going terribly wrong. The episode was progressing unusually fast, and the ghost story of the Seventh Tower had already started its full activity.

'Damn it...'

Cold sweat dripped down my body. It wasn't that I hadn't anticipated this. There had been several changes in the episodes so far, and each time, I had struggled. I had a vague feeling it would be like this. I just hoped it wouldn't be.

'No matter how much the episodes change at will, this is too much.'

Professor Meizen Tiren, the main subject of the Black Magic Erosion, had disappeared and been replaced by someone else... It couldn't be helped. Still, I was relieved that it wasn't too late. Flame's party had only entered the Seventh Tower a few hours ago.

I quickly prepared and headed to the Seventh Tower. This episode was unique in that the player had to find the entrance to the dungeon themselves. Unlike usual quests where the guide map would say 'head here,' this episode required the player to uncover the mysteries and ghost stories directly.

At first, many people were confused and couldn't progress the episode properly. I was one of those fools, but who are the veterans? They eventually figured out all the dungeon entrances, all the mysteries of the ghost stories, all the routes, all the shortcuts, and various clearing methods, and posted the final summary on the community. There's no other way to describe them but as madmen.

Thanks to them, I was grateful. Because of their efforts, I had no obstacles on my way to the Seventh Tower. However, there was one concern.

'I hope Flame doesn't overdo it until I get there...'

In the original game, Flame had a tendency to explode with all his might whenever an incident occurred, so I couldn't help but worry. Moreover, there was one more thing I couldn't tell Flame due to a lack of [Narrative Power].

[Newbies, be careful when clearing the Seventh Tower dungeon with the Flame character]
[There's a full-length mirror behind the boss, don't approach it]
[For some reason, if Flame touches the full-length mirror, the character dies instantly]
[It seems to be a bug since it doesn't affect other characters??]

It was a bug that was never fixed or explained. If it wasn't a bug but had some reason behind it?

'...I don't know. I have to get there quickly before anything happens.'

Squelch!

A feeling of piercing through space enveloped me, and I was instantly sucked into another world. A world where all colors were inverted. There, I chose the most efficient and fastest route and sprinted towards Flame with all my might.

* * *

The reason why the final boss of this story, Meizen Tiren, was dangerous was that he could handle the magic of all the students who entered the Seventh Tower. In the original novel, Meizen pressured Angel with infinite mana and various magics instead of the abilities of a black magician. At that time, Haewonryang could identify the enemy's weaknesses with amazing insight even in extreme situations.

Even during the battle, Professor Meizen Tiren hardly used the unique physical abilities of a black magician, staying in the same spot as if protecting something. I realized it immediately.

'The full-length mirror is the weakness.'

With that one sentence from Haewonryang in the original novel, Meizen Tiren was startled, and Haewonryang, gaining confidence from that reaction, approached the mirror and shattered it with a close-range spell.

'I can win.'

Whoosh! Boom!

Blocking the incoming giant flame with a shield of light, Flame looked at the mirror standing behind Checkiren. That ominous mirror emitting a gloomy aura was the object causing this ghost story incident and the core artifact maintaining the Seventh Tower.

"Hiyaah!"

As Anella let out a cute battle cry and punched, the earth wall protecting Professor Checkiren was half-destroyed. Through the gap, Angel shot a lightning bolt, but the scattered stone fragments in the air blocked all the attacks.

Crackle!

However, defying the laws of science, Angel's blue lightning chained through the earth and struck Professor Checkiren directly.

Crack-!

"Ugh...!"

The shield protecting Professor Checkiren didn't break, but it cracked like a spider web.

"For a first-year, that's impressive."

But the cracked shield quickly recovered. It was much faster than the time it took other students to recover their shields. Indeed, even though he was a black magician, he wasn't a professor for nothing.

At first glance, it seemed like there was no chance of winning. Even in a normal magic battle, we were at a disadvantage, and the opponent could exert even stronger power.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

"Argh!"

The half-destroyed stone fragments floated into the air and then fell at a terrifying speed, causing Anella to jump around in fright.

"Ha!"

As Flame struck the ground with his staff, pillars of light rose and shattered the falling stone fragments. But the attack didn't end there.

Boom! Boom!

A giant lightning bolt pierced through the dome from the sky! Its power was at least 5th class, and if hit, the shield wouldn't hold.

"Dodge it!"

Crackle!!

Sensing the lightning in advance, Anella quickly threw herself, and Angel cast an ice shield towards the ceiling.

"Huff...!"

However, it wasn't enough to completely block the lightning. Some of the lightning fragments wrapped around Angel's body.

"Damn it, really..."

Flame hurriedly placed his hand on the ground, summoning green tree vines to wrap around Angel's body like armor. The lightning quickly dissipated and disappeared.

'How do I approach the mirror?'

I had already explained the plan. If there was a core to create this kind of space, I would destroy it, so they should buy me time. But Professor Checkiren fought much better than expected, making it impossible to approach.

'Any magic I cast from afar will be blocked... Coordinate creation magic is too weak to break the mirror, and if I cast magic from afar, its power will be halved, and Checkiren will notice and defend. He won't leave his vital part unprotected.'

'This is driving me crazy.'

In the original novel, Professor Meizen was an alchemist. He was forced to switch to alchemy due to his lack of magical talent, so he couldn't handle magic of this scale properly. Thanks to that, Haewonryang found a chance to break the mirror.

But Professor Checkiren was a professor of elemental magic, so he was skilled in combat. Honestly, he had abilities far superior to most combat magicians despite being a black magician. Because of that, even with Anella joining, we couldn't approach with three people.

'No, there is a way.'

Flame looked at Anella, who was jumping around like a frog. She had awakened her physical abilities, showing incredible speed and power beyond imagination.

'She might not be as good as Uncle or Mayuseong... but I can use her as a knight.'

As soon as he thought that, Flame shouted loudly.

"Anella! I just found out that the mirror behind that bastard is the weak point! Go and break it!"

"Huh, what?!"

Anella's eyes widened in surprise. Her expression seemed to say, 'Was it okay to say that?'

Of course, we had already discussed targeting the mirror before arriving here. But the basic strategy was to keep the opponent unaware of our target. Yet, he just blurted it out?

"Ah... got it!"

But what could she do? Thinking there must be a reason, Anella charged towards the mirror as Flame instructed.

"Where do you think you're going?!"

Crack! Boom!

Anella's sudden leap wasn't as fast as a power jump, but it was still quite fast, so Checkiren focused on her. He gathered debris to form a giant boulder and rolled it, ignited flames in the air, and shot lightning bolts and ice shards to block Anella's path.

"Aaah!"

No matter how she thought about it, this was wrong. She was really going to die! Seeing the magic flying at her with no gaps to dodge, tears welled up in Anella's eyes.

'Ah, I'm going to die at forty, without even having a romance.'

But at that moment, a golden magic circle spun around Anella's body, summoning dozens of chains that deflected all the incoming magic. The lightning dissipated along the chains, the boulder was stopped by the chains, and the ice shards were deflected by the chains wielded like whips.

'This is...!'

It was undoubtedly Flame's magic. Each chain was only at the 4th class level, but having dozens of them meant... Flame was overexerting himself to protect Anella with this magic.

'Damn it, then I can't stop either!'

Not relying entirely on the chains, Anella used her dynamic vision and leg strength to the fullest. She dodged and blocked as much magic as she could with her fists, conserving Flame's mana as she advanced.

"A traitor being protected by a magician, how amusing!"

Checkiren gritted his teeth and clenched his fist. A giant golden wall rose from the ground to trap Anella, but...

Drip!

"Ugh!"

The gold didn't solidify and melted back into the ground. 'Why?'

A student possessed by the ghosts and shadows of the Seventh Tower would have all their magic absorbed by Checkiren. Jeremy Scalven must have been completely possessed by the ghost. He should have absorbed all his magic...

'Damn it!'

Now wasn't the time to think about that. The magic he had prepared to trap her had failed, and Anella was getting closer.

'It's okay to kill one of them, right?'

The magic absorbed through the ghosts and shadows was hard to fully accept. To absorb Angel and Flame's magic at high purity, he had to subdue them without killing them, so he was holding back his power. But Anella could be killed. She was a black magician, so there was nothing to absorb from her.

"Stop being a nuisance and die."

Swoosh!

A black aura coiled around Checkiren's wrist like a snake, forming a small sphere. It wasn't absorbed magic, but Checkiren's original ability as a black magician. As it was completed and aimed at Anella...

...Crack!

Something cold pricked Checkiren's senses.

'Danger.'

His instincts screamed. If he didn't defend quickly, something terrible would happen. He stopped casting the spell and turned his gaze, only to see Flame, who had approached with a light cluster at the tip of his staff, running towards the mirror.

'Ah.'

The power of that magic was undoubtedly above 4th class. Although he had placed some defensive magic around the mirror, it was uncertain if it could fully block the light magic.

'I have to stop it...!'

Checkiren gritted his teeth and calculated the magic to stop Flame. He could stop him without killing him. That was his judgment, but...

-Do not stop him.

"...What?"

The 'voice' that had been silent throughout the battle suddenly gave an order. It was so unexpected that Checkiren made a dumbfounded face, and by then, Flame had already reached the full-length mirror.

"Hiyaah!"

With a battle cry, Flame thrust the tip of his staff into the mirror. Flash-!

An enormous light burst out momentarily, but... it was soon covered by the black aura emanating from the mirror.

"...Huh?"

Sensing something was wrong, Flame tried to pull back, but it was too late.

-Child of the stars, do not resent me.

The black shadow swallowed Flame whole.

-This too is fate.
