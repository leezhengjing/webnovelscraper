# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 201: A Gamble with Time (4)

A typical magician must reach the level of a 3rd-class mage to finally obtain the qualification of a 'Magic Warrior.' If those with average talent work diligently, they can achieve 3rd-class in their late twenties to early thirties. However, the path to becoming a Magic Warrior is not as easy as it seems.

Becoming an official Magic Warrior is not the end. One must continuously study and train while accumulating experience through missions to barely reach the 4th-class. By then, several years would have passed, and they would receive some recognition within the Magic Tower or guild.

In other words, achieving 4th-class 'normally' requires tremendous effort and a lot of time.

"Ah, I'm telling you the truth! Can't you believe me?"

"Huh, these kids..."

Gerwin, the branch manager of the Steel Pine Adventurer Guild in the city of Lahendark, couldn't hide his troubled expression as he looked at the two girls in front of him.

"So, you're saying both of you are 4th-class mages and want to join the Karakorn Mountain expedition?"

"Ugh, it's hard to believe..."

Other adventurers waiting in the Steel Pine Guild office also glanced at the two girls. The girl with hair as refreshing as a flowing blue waterfall and the girl with short black hair had such beautiful appearances that even adults couldn't help but turn their heads.

Just standing still, they attracted attention from all directions, and claiming to be 4th-class mages only drew more eyes.

"Can't you see the Stella uniform? Look at this. It's Stella. I even have a pocket watch."

When the black-haired girl, Flame, spoke clearly and showed the Stella pocket watch, Gerwin reluctantly took it and examined it with wide eyes.

"This is... real."

"Right? You can recognize that, right?"

"Yes, I understand that you're from Stella. But... it's hard to believe that you're 4th-class mages in just your first year."

Although Flame and Angel had appeared in newspapers a few times, not everyone memorized all the faces that appeared in the news. Moreover, while official mages receive updated certifications with each class they achieve, students do not receive formal certifications, making it difficult for Flame and Angel to prove their abilities.

It was understandable since it was extremely rare for teenagers to achieve 3rd-class, and even then, it was usually from prestigious magic schools like Stella, which was not legally regulated.

"Ah, seriously, this frustrating old man!"

Feeling stifled, Flame pounded her chest. It was good that they had confidently left Stella to find the relic of the Silver Eleven Moon. However, despite being 4th-class mages, Flame and Angel were still young and inexperienced. Traveling alone in dangerous areas was inefficient, so they decided to join an expedition team.

Fortunately, there was an expedition team with a similar purpose that had been organized for several years. However, Flame overlooked the fact that society was not as accommodating to young mages as she thought.

"Ugh, even if it's true, you're too young. Stella students sometimes come out on missions, but they are at least in their second year."

By this point, Flame had somewhat realized that Gerwin was reluctant to include high-profile Stella students in the expedition. If an accident occurred, it could cause unnecessary trouble. Although there was a clause stating that Stella students were responsible for their own injuries, it still made him uneasy.

"Ah, seriously..."

As Flame bit her pink lips and swallowed her frustration, a tanned woman who had been drinking strong liquor alone at a distant table stood up and spoke.

"Gerwin, just take them along."

"Kyla... what are you saying all of a sudden?"

"I'm interested in those kids. I'll take responsibility. Okay?"

"You'll take responsibility?"

Gerwin alternated his gaze between Kyla and Flame, then sighed deeply and nodded.

"Well, if you say so... Actually, if they're 4th-class Magic Warriors, they could be a great help even without experience..."

"Wise choice, branch manager!"

Thwack!

"Ouch!"

Kyla, who had slapped Gerwin's back hard, approached the two girls and put her arms around their shoulders, bringing her face close.

"Alright, to celebrate our new comrades, shall we go for a drink?"

"...We're minors."

"Eh, who cares about that!"

Angel felt uneasy about this woman named Kyla, but Flame smiled brightly and grabbed her hands, shaking them up and down.

"Let's have a drink together, sister!"

"Yes, you get along well with me!"

"Of course!"

And the next morning...

"Ugh..."

Angel sighed deeply as she looked at Flame, who had drunk heavily despite being a minor and was now passed out.

"If we get caught, we'll be suspended... I warned you."

Flame had nonsensically claimed that she was an adult at heart and drank recklessly. Judging by her behavior, it seemed she had drunk before and was likely a delinquent student.

"Sigh."

After straightening Flame, who was sleeping in a half-hanging position on the bed, Angel left the room to take a shower. Outside the inn, Kyla, who had drunk heavily with Flame the previous night, was squatting in front of the main building, smoking a cigarette with a grim expression.

"Oh, cutie. You're up."

"Yes. How's your stomach?"

"Terrible. Feels like I'm dying."

"...We're leaving today. Why did you overdo it?"

"Oh, are you worried about me?"

"Not really..."

Kyla took a deep drag on her cigarette, exhaled a large puff of smoke, and stood up.

"Kid, do you know why I decided to take you along?"

"Huh? I don't know..."

"I've seen your faces in the newspaper a few times. Those ignorant guys probably don't even read the newspaper properly."

"Oh, I see..."

"Yes. So I was curious. I wanted to see how the famous Stella students would fare in the Karakorn Mountains. Do you know why we're going on this expedition?"

"Of course."

The Karakorn Mountains were known for their mysterious phenomena. Adventurers would disappear entirely, only to reappear in the same place ten years later without having aged a day. A child's diary, written three years in the future, would be found discarded on the ground. Objects falling from the sky would stop mid-air for years before suddenly dropping and causing accidents. Ancient artifacts, presumed to be from long ago, would be found looking brand new. The place was full of mysteries.

Many adventurers had tried to uncover the secrets of the Karakorn Mountains, but most returned empty-handed. As a result, expeditions had become less frequent recently, as there was little to gain.

"Well... if it weren't for the recent disappearance case, we wouldn't be doing this pointless task."

The reason for organizing such expeditions was obvious. When the children of high-ranking officials or wealthy individuals went missing, they would hire adventurers out of desperation.

Magic Warriors and adventuring mages are distinctly different. While Magic Warriors break through Persona Gates and hunt dark beings, adventurers specialize in solving mysterious cases. Even those adventurers had given up on the mysteries of the Karakorn Mountains.

"Pointless task...?"

"Yes, exactly. It's obvious we'll come back empty-handed."

She flicked her cigarette.

"I've been a mercenary for twelve years, and this is my fifth time in the Karakorn Mountains. But it's always a waste of time. There's nothing to find."

Although adventurers might not know, Angel was aware that the mysterious phenomena in the Karakorn Mountains were likely caused by the relic of the Silver Eleven Moon. However, knowing that didn't change much. Just because they knew something was there didn't guarantee they could find it.

"So, this time, I thought I'd take you along."

"...What?"

"I figured if you're Stella students, you'd be smart. Plus, there's a lot of talk about you two being geniuses who appear once in a thousand years."

"That's an exaggeration."

"Haha, don't be shy. Anyway, I'm counting on you for this expedition."

With that, Kyla went back into the inn.

"Sigh..."

Angel was relieved to have someone in the unfamiliar expedition team who treated them well. But she couldn't shake off a strange, uneasy feeling.

'Why do I feel so uneasy... What is this strange and ambiguous feeling? I still don't know.'

In conclusion, Huaseorin's judgment was correct. Just spending time together in the city at night, rather than fighting, was enough to draw out the resonance of the relic. As a result, I successfully absorbed part of Huaseorin's power.

The moon set, and the sun rose. In the early morning, when everyone was asleep, Huaseorin secretly removed her veil and embraced the warm sunlight. Watching her spread her arms as if to hug the sun, I felt a sense of pride.

However, not everything was good. I had reached my limit. I hadn't fully absorbed Huaseorin's curse, but I had received so much of the blessing of Yeonhongchun Samwol that I couldn't handle the mana leakage delay.

Fortunately, another blessing of the Twelve Divine Moons prevented the excessive energy from overflowing, but it wasn't enough. I would need to receive Huaseorin's blessing at least twice more, and it would take me several years to grow enough to handle it.

'How did Flame manage this?'

In the original game, the character Flame was known to have resolved Huaseorin's curse in one go. Perhaps, just a guess, Flame might have completely won over Huaseorin's heart with the power of love, overcoming the curse with intense emotions.

Does that sound ridiculous? Don't expect too much from a romance fantasy game. The word 'romance' itself is already a fantasy, and adding 'fantasy' again makes this world full of absurdities.

"Are you alright?"

"Yes... I'm fine... It's wonderful..."

Huaseorin smiled as she embraced the warm sunlight. I couldn't possibly steal her heart. So, I had to resolve her curse in my own way.

I needed to grow. Explosive growth that could handle Huaseorin's curse. But growth takes time and patience. The only remaining method was to accept the power of another Twelve Divine Moons.

I've already met two of the Twelve Divine Moons and accepted their power. Is it too soon? Absolutely not. I believe the Twelve Divine Moons are the key to guiding this world in the right direction. So, I plan to meet as many of them as possible before graduation.

Even if I can't receive their blessings immediately, just meeting them and raising their favorability would be enough for now. So, the next Twelve Divine Moon to meet is...

'Eunse Eleven Moon.'

A very special being who controls the silver time, hiding all their power and living among people. I've decided to meet that person.
