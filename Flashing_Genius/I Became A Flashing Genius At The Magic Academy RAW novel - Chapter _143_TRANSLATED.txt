# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 143

## 35. School Competition (1)

Occasionally, even the most trivial stories can make it into the news and become a topic of conversation. Such was the case with the story of Anella, who collapsed immediately after meeting the famous young magician Baek Yuseol from Stella. 

A considerable number of paparazzi were waiting at the caf√© Baek Yuseol frequented, and the moment Anella handed him a piece of paper for an autograph, she fainted, and the scene was vividly captured on camera.

---

Anella opened her eyes slowly, grimacing at the splitting headache. The voices of chattering girls echoed softly.

"Hey, Anella is awake."

"Oh? Really?"

"O~ The princess has awakened~"

As she slowly opened her eyes and turned her head, she recognized the girls sitting around her as familiar faces. She suddenly remembered that she had infiltrated Stella as an exchange student and activated 'Nightmare's Return' on Baek Yuseol... "Gasp!"

She quickly sat up, causing her head to throb painfully, but she didn't care.

"Wh-where am I...?"

"Whoa, you don't need to get up so quickly."

"Yeah, you should rest a bit more."

"Hehe, do you remember why you fainted?"

Her friends looked at her with mischievous and playful eyes, whispering quietly.

"Your wish came true? Your beloved is waiting for you?"

"What...?"

Anella shivered at those words and slowly turned her creaking head. This was a hospital room, a rather spacious one at that. In the corner, Baek Yuseol was sitting on a chair, reading a book. 

Noticing that she had woken up, Baek Yuseol closed his book and looked at her intently. Anella felt an overwhelming sense of fear and helplessness from him.

"I-I'm going to die..."

"Do you like him that much?"

"Baek Yuseol is sweeter than I thought."

"Yeah, he didn't leave your side all day, waiting for you to wake up."

"W-what...?"

Around that time, Anella's complexion began to turn pale, but no one noticed. While others might see him as sweet, to her, he felt like a predator slowly tightening its grip on its prey.

When Baek Yuseol stood up, the girls made a fuss and quickly fled the room.

"Good luck!"

They even made playful gestures with their fists, but Anella, who usually found them annoying, wanted to scream for them not to leave at this moment.

"Click."

As Baek Yuseol approached the bed and sat down on a chair, Anella let out an involuntary shriek.

"...Anella di Polance."

"Y-yes..."

"You're a student at Hanalea Magic School in the Kingdom of Severun, currently here as an exchange student at Stella."

"Yes..."

"And you're a dark magician."

Her whole body shivered. What should she do? Unlike other skilled dark magicians, she couldn't unseal her dark magic on her own. Moreover, her abilities didn't work on him...

'W-what is this...'

She couldn't feel any mana in her body at all. It was as if she was paralyzed. She had never felt such helplessness before. Even if she had mana, could she have resisted him?

"Ugh..."

As Anella trembled without saying a word, Baek Yuseol sighed. He had intended to threaten her, but he didn't expect her to be so terrified.

'Anella di Polance...'

He didn't know much about her name, but his glasses had recorded information about her.

[An occasional helper NPC who appears if you're lucky]

[Appears as an enemy, but can be a great help if successfully influenced]

Anella was a hidden NPC in 'Aether World Online,' whose appearance depended on the player's choices. While the exact conditions for her appearance were unknown, it was noted that she appeared with a certain probability when the player gradually conquered the 'Castle of Mayu.'

In other words, Anella had infiltrated to monitor the changes in the Castle of Mayu. His glasses also recorded that she had infiltrated Stella under the orders of the 'Black King,' the right hand of the Dark Magic King.

Regardless of her circumstances, she had tried to break his spirit by triggering his trauma, and he had no intention of letting that slide.

"Anella."

"...Yes?"

"Why did you try to kill me?"

But first, it was best to extract as much information as possible. When Baek Yuseol asked calmly, Anella swallowed hard.

"That is..."

"If you don't speak clearly, I might really have to kill you right here."

"I don't want to do that, so please tell me properly."

Anella, who had been hesitating with her head down, slowly prioritized her thoughts. She had failed all her missions, including monitoring the Castle of Mayu and eliminating Baek Yuseol. If she returned like this... she would die. Even if she didn't, she wouldn't be treated well.

But she couldn't betray them either. She couldn't unseal the dark magic bound to her heart on her own.

'What should I do...'

If she betrayed the Black King, she would have to live with a half-crippled body forever.

"Speak."

But she didn't have enough loyalty to the Black King to keep her mouth shut in front of Baek Yuseol, so she decided to tell the truth to save her life. She confessed that she had infiltrated Stella under the Black King's orders and had been ordered to kill him.

"As expected..."

Baek Yuseol nodded, having already understood everything from that alone.

'So the dark magicians are also paying attention to my existence.'

That was the situation Baek Yuseol had least wanted. If the dark magicians started moving in earnest, he wouldn't be able to stop them with his current weak body. He had wanted to move quietly in the shadows, but he had become so famous that he couldn't escape their attention.

"...That's enough for now."

"Yes..."

He was more curious about Anella's ability, 'Nightmare's Return,' than information about the dark magicians.

"I want to know about your ability, 'Nightmare's Return.'"

"My ability..."

"Yes. What exactly does it do? It shows the trauma I experienced in the past, right?"

Nod, nod, nod.

That's why Anella feared Baek Yuseol. What kind of past had he experienced to have so many 'deaths' buried in his trauma?

The experience was so shocking that she couldn't remember it in detail, but it was probably the most horrific experience of her life. 

Even so, she had a thought. Anella had always believed that she lived the most miserable, painful, and sorrowful life. She had a valid reason for thinking so. Her ability, 'Nightmare's Return,' allowed her to peek into others' traumas and see who was more unfortunate.

But until now, not a single person had a trauma that could impact Anella. Others' traumas were just slightly painful and sad stories to her.

But after experiencing Baek Yuseol's past, she had to reconsider. His trauma was a continuous series of pain that was hard to accept with her mental strength. Death, followed by death, and more death.

So, even while being threatened by Baek Yuseol, she couldn't help but ask.

"Who... what are you?"

But Baek Yuseol didn't answer. He just looked at her quietly and then stood up.

"I'll let you go, so take care of yourself from now on."

"...What?"

"Go back. If you can."

"Th-that..."

Knowing that she had lost all will to fight, there was no point in threatening her further. He had already obtained information from his glasses that she was harmless even if left alive, and he knew that Anella was inherently weak-willed.

She had never properly killed or devoured a human, and she had barely survived by occasionally drinking blood. Her only useful ability, 'Nightmare's Return,' allowed her to infiltrate others' minds and extract information, so she wouldn't die even if she returned.

'I'm not sure if she has the guts to give up her mission to monitor the Castle of Mayu and return...'

Thinking that, Baek Yuseol left the hospital room.

'...Go back if you can?'

Left alone, Anella clutched her pounding heart. It sounded like he was saying, 'Try going back, and you'll really die.'

'If I try to leave now... he'll punish me immediately, right...?'

Trembling all over, Anella swallowed hard. It seemed she couldn't leave Stella until she completed all her courses and received official permission to return...

## [Magic Survival Acceptance Notification]

A few days later, the results of the screening were announced. As expected, none of the main characters participated in this sub-event. 

It was an event that occasionally included Mayuseong, Flame, Hong Biyeon, and Angel, and sometimes even Haewonryang or Jeremy participated.

There was only one name on the list of first-year qualifiers.

### [First Year]

"Did you hear? A first-year student is participating this year."

"Yeah, it's Baek Yuseol."

"He's got an impressive win rate against seniors."

"Well, he's faced dark magicians several times, so he has real combat experience."

Stories about Baek Yuseol spread throughout the school. His name shone even brighter as the only first-year participant.

Baek Yuseol found it absurd. The main characters had unexpectedly not participated, so he suddenly received all the attention.

'Should I call this a windfall...'

He didn't feel good about it. The strongest contender for the championship, Mayuseong, had dropped out, so Stella's victory was practically out of reach.

'The reward for winning is quite useful in the next episode...'

It was unfortunate, but there was nothing he could do. He had to make do without it. Knowing that he couldn't win with his current strength, Baek Yuseol was making a different plan.

"Um, excuse me..."

"Huh?"

While he was quietly looking at the class bulletin board, a small voice came from beside him.

"Why again?"

"I was wondering if there's anything I can help with..."

It was Anella. Her face was full of tears, and she was glancing at Baek Yuseol nervously. He found her pitiful but also absurd.

'I told her to go back, so what's she doing here?'

Or had she been abandoned by her headquarters? He had no intention of working with someone who had tried to kill him. But he didn't want to kill Anella, who had become a dark magician due to circumstances and was inherently weak, so he had let her go.

But she kept clinging to him, and he didn't know what to do.

"Go back to the dormitory and do nothing."

"Yes!"

Anella really seemed to be heading back to the dormitory to do nothing.

"...Wait, hey, hold on."

"Yes?"

"I'll allow you to hang out with your friends..."

"Yes!"

What a unique character, he thought. In the original game, she was described as a loyal subordinate. If he raised her favorability a bit more, he could extract important information or use her as a double agent against the dark magicians. So, it might be better to leave her as she was.

"Baek Yuseol."

"Huh?"

When he looked to the side, wondering who it was this time, he saw Hong Biyeon leaning against the wall, looking at him. She had a displeased expression.

"You seem to be having fun."

Her voice seemed to imply, 'I'm struggling, and you're having fun?'

'What did I do wrong?'

He was curious about where she had disappeared to and why she had just shown up, but it was awkward to ask.

"Who was that girl?"

"Uh? Oh..."

Something felt off. He felt like he had to explain quickly, or something bad would happen.

"Just, a bread... shuttle..."

Whether she heard him or not, she silently stared at Baek Yuseol.

"Baek Yuseol."

"Yes... please speak."

Something felt different. Although it wasn't their first conversation, it felt like she was a different Hong Biyeon from before. She seemed more mature and closer than before.

'What is this...'

Was it possible that the future Hong Biyeon had returned and taken over her mind? He was having such wild thoughts when she approached him softly, pushing him against the wall with her palm.

Then, without saying a word, she just stared into his eyes, as if she could read his thoughts.

He felt suffocated. No matter how much of an adult Baek Yuseol was, it was overwhelming to have Hong Biyeon, with her fairy-like mysterious appearance, so close.

'Ugh.'

In the end, Baek Yuseol declared defeat by looking away first. Hong Biyeon took two steps back and spoke in a low voice, as if driving a nail into his chest.

"Don't think about going anywhere alone."

Then, she disappeared into the sunlight streaming through the corridor.

"What the heck..."

He touched his chest, still feeling Hong Biyeon's warmth, and looked at the corridor where she had disappeared.

'Why is everyone acting like this...'

The original characters had changed so much that he felt he knew less about them now than he did before.
