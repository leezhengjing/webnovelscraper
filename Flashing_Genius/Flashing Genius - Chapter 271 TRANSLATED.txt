A crimson, oval-shaped barrier, vast enough to touch the very edge of the sky, spread out with Isaac Morph’s body at its center. Hong Biyeon, while constructing the Fire Spirit Formation, simultaneously activated the compass of memory she held within her heart. Mana does not leak out. No one notices.

“Dual Casting,” the act of casting two or more spells at once, might be a daunting task for a 4th-Class mage, but her concentration was exceptional. Considering that Eizel, at the 3rd-Class level, had used “Transcendental Superimposed Resonance,” a spell that was impossible for anyone below the 6th-Class, Hong Biyeon already using Dual Casting wasn’t particularly strange. Their talents and efforts were boundless, reaching for the heavens.

*Woo-woo-wooong!!* The compass of memory, indicating the direction of time, began to spin. One year and four months ago, nine years and seven months ago, 71 years ago, 34 years ago, three years and six months ago. The time it was pointing to was all jumbled up. It was her fault for not being able to control the compass properly. Perhaps these times were all events that left a mark on history, etched into the memories of this place.

“I need to find the exact time.” She was cold to herself. This compass wasn’t a simple artifact that a mere 4th-Class mage could easily handle. If she accidentally looked through the memories of a distant past, she might not be able to return.

“It’s okay. My calculations are accurate.” She had prepared thoroughly for this moment. She lightly detached her hand from her staff and effortlessly unraveled the Fire Spirit Formation. With the construction perfectly finished, it would sustain itself with Hong Biyeon’s mana until the purification ritual ended, even without her interference. From now on, she would look back into the past.

*Huup!* *Charr-r-r-r!!* As she poured mana with all her might, the compass’s spin became increasingly rough, and when its speed finally surpassed the critical point…

…*Bang!* In that instant, a blinding white light flashed before her eyes.

*Ah.* When she opened her eyes again, the wind blew. A cold and dry autumn wind. But it was different from the wind in the present. Hong Biyeon slowly lowered her head and looked down at the ground. Where the grand altar had been just moments ago, there was nothing.

“…I’ve arrived.” There was no time to waste. The time she could spend glancing through the memories of the past was extremely short. Having consumed a considerable amount of mana and mental strength for the Fire Spirit Formation’s construction and the evasion of the magic prohibition, she could only stay for about an hour at most.

“I have to hurry.” During the process of browsing through memories, she could not move by foot. Since this was a process of looking through past “memories,” she needed to adjust the coordinates to observe other locations.

*Thung!* With a slight expenditure of mana to move to an adjacent location, a barrack, presumably an outpost, appeared before her.

“This is… the Morph Magic Corps’ command barrack?” Turning her head to scan the area, she immediately saw the outpost of Adolerebit, the mage tower, and the Magic Academy’s tents.

“So it is.” The Magic Assembly back then had formed an alliance to eradicate the dark mage Isaac Morph, hadn’t they? But… something was strange.

“Your Highness, please do not worry and rest.”

“It’s settled. I must see the final preparations with my own eyes. The battle will commence tomorrow, and I cannot rest easy.”

*Uh…?* Clearly, the forces gathered at this location were intended to eliminate Isaac Morph, but why was the target himself walking confidently amongst the allied forces?

*What in the world…*

“Your Highness.”

“…Why?”

“You appear troubled.”

“Yes. I am worried about facing the White Tiger Spirit, Hwalyeong, and I still wonder why Adolerebit’s princess is so fixated on that beast.”

“He, he. In my opinion…”

Isaac, talking to his aide, vanished into the distance towards the command barrack, and Hong Biyeon remained in place, pondering their conversation.

*The White Tiger Spirit, Hwalyeong…?* That’s right, wasn’t the true goal of Hong Sihwa to awaken the White Tiger Spirit, Hwalyeong, and hunt it?

*Where is that woman?* She had only a few dozen minutes left. Hong Biyeon quickly moved between the barracks by coordinate manipulation and soon found the place she was looking for.

Her detestable second sister. The barrack of Princess Hong Sihwa.

“It’s all done.” Hong Sihwa, with her top half undressed, was receiving an injection of a crimson, ominous liquid. Even though she couldn’t open her magic core to analyze the composition, it was obvious at a glance that it was no ordinary solution.

“…Yes.” Hong Sihwa, drenched in sweat, looked frail to anyone. This was the first time she’d seen her usual, annoyingly smug second sister looking so weak, and it was both unfamiliar and perplexing to Hong Biyeon.

“The pain won’t subside yet.”

“…I don’t care about the pain. As long as I don’t die, that’s all that matters.” Then she blurted out these words.

“I don’t want to be like my older sister.” Hong Biyeon’s expression hardened instantly. Mentioning her elder sister, Hong Erin, with that repulsive face was akin to a vital point for her. But the current Hong Biyeon was no longer a child. The time for her to be rash and heated by every word Hong Sihwa spoke was over.

*She doesn’t want to be like her older sister…* Her elder sister, Hong Erin, had been blessed with the flame so strongly that it had become a curse instead, and she had perished at a young age, losing her pitiful life. Hong Sihwa and Hong Biyeon would soon share the same fate.

“Princess Hong Sihwa, do you truly believe that you can find a way to “break the curse of the Adolerebit brand” from the White Tiger Spirit, Hwalyeong?”

As the doctor’s words reached her ears, Hong Biyeon finally understood why she was committing this reckless act.

*She wants to find a chance to break the curse by taking down the White Tiger Spirit, Hwalyeong?* Yes, that much was fine.

*But she failed.* She knew this because she had secretly stolen Hong Sihwa’s diary earlier. Hong Sihwa had failed, and Isaac Morph would fall into corruption.

Suddenly, she recalled Isaac’s troubled expression from earlier, and immediately shifted coordinates. She arrived at Isaac’s private barrack.

“I don’t know… Is it truly right to release the White Tiger Spirit’s seal just to ensure the princess’s safety?”

“Your Highness, we can completely subdue the White Tiger. Don’t worry. Princess Hong Sihwa wouldn’t have come without a plan.”

“That’s… that’s right. Even her guts, daring to blackmail the Duke at such a young age, shows she’s definitely up to something shady. If she stays here for five years, no, ten years… she’ll become an even more terrifying mage.”

Blackmail. She definitely said that. Come to think of it, Hong Sihwa herself had written in her diary that she had “blackmailed Duke Morph.”

*What happens after this…* This story of the White Tiger Spirit’s unsealing was something she’d never heard of before. She had no knowledge of how the incident was resolved.

*There’s no time for this. I’ve gathered most of the information I could here.* Hong Biyeon hastily manipulated the compass of memory, adjusting the history she could glimpse to 12 hours later.

…*Thung-kung!*

*Ugh?!*  An immediate, full-body shock nearly caused Hong Biyeon to lose her balance. Even though her body didn’t exist because she was just looking at the past, the shock was so intense that it made her feel like she was about to fall.

…Raising her head, Hong Biyeon let out a sigh. The world was completely bathed in white. Warriors lay broken. The royal family and the Duke’s army were kneeling.

*How arrogant of you, descendants of Adolerebit…* It was higher than mountains, steeper than cliffs, bluer than the sky, lighter than clouds. Seeing “it,” Hong Biyeon felt a sense of awe.

One who had awakened the ultimate flame. One who had gazed at the end of flames. Its heart burned hotter than the sun, radiating the purest white light, as if to erase everything in the world.

Knowing it was wrong, Hong Biyeon couldn’t help but admire it. She wanted to burn like that. She wanted to be enveloped in those white flames. Even if she couldn’t bear it and perished, if she could become the flame itself…

*…Ugh!*  Suddenly feeling nauseous, Hong Biyeon quickly shook her head to regain her senses.

*No way…*  She belatedly realized the situation. Even the 8th-Class mages had all fallen, the knights were wiped out. The remaining forces were countable on one hand, and even they were incapacitated. It was hopeless.

*Since I’ve opened my eyes again, I will cover the world in my flames, as promised. Sit there and understand, Adolerebit. The White Tiger Spirit, Hwalyeong, will…*

The White Tiger Spirit uttered unfathomable words and began to move with graceful strides. Every step it took would engulf the world in white flames, returning it to a blank slate.

Even Hong Biyeon, who was simply observing the memories, was overwhelmed by its imposing aura and couldn’t move. Then, someone stood in its path. Isaac Morph.

“You… cannot pass through here.”  Although half of his body was melted by the flames, he did not fall. But with such a body, what could he possibly do?

That thought crossed her mind.

“I am not a descendant of Morph.”  Isaac Morph raised his unknown black sword and declared.

“From today… I will become a dark mage.”

The fight was truly intense. Or rather, could it even be called a fight? How could the spectacle of calamity clashing against calamity be expressed in human language?

Ice and flames covered the world, shattering and erasing all life in this land. At the end of the battle… Isaac Morph stood alone.

Was it a blessing or a curse? He seemed to retain a bit of reason, as his eyes shone with sadness. But if he was left alone, he would surely lose his reason soon after and escape the forest to turn the city into a wasteland.

*Such a record… does not exist in history.* But the Magic Corps was wiped out. If the miracle of Isaac Morph stopping himself were to occur, then perhaps there would be no one left to stop him…

*No. No, there was one.*  She desperately tried to recall Hong Sihwa’s diary.

*[When I woke up again, both the White Tiger Spirit, Hwalyeong, and the rampaging Duke Isaac Morph were down.]*

The moment she remembered that, a brilliant golden light suddenly burst forth from the void, and a giant wheel appeared, spinning rapidly.

*What… is that?*  Hong Biyeon, seeing this never-before-seen summoning, stared wide-eyed, only to belatedly notice the man in black who appeared with the wheel.

*Huh?* But his clothes were strange. He was wearing a white mask, and his attire was strangely similar to Stella’s uniform. Even without the distinctive patterns and designs, it was recognizable at a glance.  It was too similar to be simply a resemblance.

More importantly, he looked familiar, even though she had definitely never seen him before.

*Wait, could that unidentified man be…!*

*Whi-ee-ee-ee!!* A vortex of magic raged around them. Isaac slowly turned his head, looking behind him at the man, and opened his mouth.

“You are Baek Yuseol. You have come… to stop me?”

*Yes.*  She realized. That familiar voice. That familiar silhouette. That familiar scent of mana.

*Baek Yuseol…?*  She had never lost sight of Baek Yuseol’s unique characteristics, even in her imagination. It was impossible for her to mistake those traits, only he possessed them.

“I am in a very dangerous state now, so… are you sure it’s okay?”

“Didn’t I promise?” Baek Yuseol, pointing his sword at Isaac, said.

“To protect Eizel.”

“…That’s right. That’s right.” What in the world was going on? Why was Baek Yuseol in the past, 10 years ago, and what did he mean by protecting Eizel?

*He’s not just a simple time-traveler…?*

Isaac, with sad eyes, met Baek Yuseol’s gaze and spoke.

“Then, please stop me.”

With that, Isaac and Baek Yuseol clashed. It was… not the Baek Yuseol that Hong Biyeon knew. An overwhelming power, at least 8th-Class, or perhaps even higher. He stood toe to toe with Isaac, who was like a calamity, and finally, he melted the eternally enduring frozen earth of Isaac’s ice.

It was a mysterious event. The ice didn’t harm Baek Yuseol. It was as if he were protected by ice.

Baek Yuseol aimed his sword at his heart, and Isaac closed his eyes. If he simply pierced his heart with the sword, everything would be over.

Hong Biyeon sighed. The cause of Eizel’s collapse, the event that brought destruction, had been caused directly by Baek Yuseol’s hand.

*Puuk!*  Ignoring Isaac’s feeble resistance, Baek Yuseol mercilessly pierced his heart without hesitation.

Unable to bear the sight of that gruesome scene, she tried to turn her head, but Baek Yuseol abruptly withdrew his sword before finishing the deed.

*Huh?* Why didn’t he finish him off?

*Dududududu!!*  The sound of hooves echoed from all directions. The Magic Corps, sensing the dark magic surge, was charging towards this location.

*Oh…*

…and far off in the distance, Hong Sihwa’s awakening reflected in Hong Biyeon’s pupils.

*What is she going to do…?*

Baek Yuseol addressed Isaac.

“History cannot be changed.”

Hearing that, Hong Biyeon had a hunch. The Baek Yuseol she was seeing now was not standing here through ordinary means. He had gone back in time through some extraordinary method.

“People will remember it like this. The dark mage Isaac Morph went on a rampage, but Hong Sihwa Adolerebit stopped him.”

*That’s right, what in the…*

Baek Yuseol stretched out his hand towards Isaac, and the golden wheel began to spin violently.

“But the truth is… you will go on a journey. This is a secret that only you and I know.”

A mysterious thing happened. A pristine, unblemished soul escaped from Isaac’s body and was absorbed into the wheel. In other words, Isaac’s soul was still alive, wandering somewhere in this world.

Having finished his task, Baek Yuseol turned his head.  Why would Hong Biyeon be standing there, of all places? Was it a coincidence? Or could he sense her very existence, merely observing memories?

Hong Biyeon felt as if she had made eye contact with Baek Yuseol. But he didn’t say a word, vanished, leaving only an afterimage behind. When the Magic Corps finally arrived, Isaac Morph was already a cold corpse.

Thus, the “Legend of Princess Hong Sihwa, Ten Years Ago” was complete. The one who truly caused the calamity was Hong Sihwa. The hero who defeated it was Isaac. And the one who stopped that hero’s rampage was Baek Yuseol. All the credit went to Hong Sihwa.

*The remaining time…*  The time she could glimpse memories was now running out. But she couldn’t go back just yet. She hadn’t solved the final mystery.

She advanced time, day by day.

*“Duke Isaac Morph is dead.”*

*“But why does such a chilling coldness emanate from his body? He must be alive!”*

*“You fool! He’s biologically dead! The magic he holds has research value!”*

A day passed, and the mages began to argue among themselves.

*“We can’t dispose of the body.”*

*“If it’s the flame of Adolerebit, we can easily burn it.”*

*“If Her Majesty the Queen comes…!”*

A day passed, and Queen Hong Seryu arrived. Until it was burned, Isaac’s body was temporarily sealed.

*“The White Tiger Spirit met its end, and Duke Isaac has been sealed.”*

*“Even so, white flames and blue ice still linger in the forest, disrupting it…”*

*“We must restore the forest’s magic.”*

Another day passed, and the forest began to be cleaned up. Quickly flipping through a week’s worth of memories, she finally found the scene she was looking for.

“We stand before the brightest flame under the heavens!”

“Your Majesty the Queen!”

The Magic Knights, clad in red armor, all knelt down at once, welcoming Adolerebit’s great queen.

Queen Hong Seryu, riding a white steed, scanned the chaotic Morph Forest with languid eyes. Then, she gracefully dismounted.

*Szaak!!*  Without hesitation, she slapped Hong Sihwa’s cheek.  The princess’s cheek turned sharply, and she staggered, but she didn’t fall. She raised her head again to face the queen.

“You have come, Your Majesty.”

“Do you know what you’ve done?”

*Yes.*

“You’re quick on the uptake. Princess Hong Sihwa, immediately restrain her magic, then throw her into the dungeons. The fact that I’m not killing you right now is a final act of mercy as a king. Remember that.”

Hong Seryu, as always, was decisive and had no hesitation about making instant judgments.  She knew that pulling her second daughter, Hong Sihwa, into this would only result in the throne going to Hong Biyeon, whom she hated, but it didn’t matter. The guilty must be punished. If this leads to Hong Biyeon becoming queen, so be it. That, too, was her fate.

“Before you leave, may I speak?”  Even though her fate was decided, Hong Sihwa, with lifeless eyes, met the queen’s gaze directly.

“So you want to make excuses. Very well, speak.”

“You may restrain my magic. You may end my life here. But please, grant me one request.”

“Audacious.”

*Wuji-g-g-g-g-g-n!!* *Hwar-r-r-r-r-r-k!!* The ground suddenly cracked, and nearby trees started to burn.  It was the result of mana radiating from Hong Seryu’s mere glance.  Hong Sihwa’s clothes also began to burn fiercely, peeling off, but she continued to speak, ignoring the pain.

“He is the one with the strongest Morph bloodline.”

“What does that have to do with anything?”

“He, too, like us, is a descendant of the Morph family, burdened with the “curse of ice.” However, they, unlike us, overcame that curse long ago.”

Curse. Blessing. Sensitive words caused Hong Seryu’s mana to gradually subside.

“And even in death, he doesn’t truly die, as endless coldness continuously emanates from his body.”

“Get to the point.”

“He is still alive. If you dispose of his body now, you will surely regret it.”

“What if he resurrects as a dark mage?”

“Seal him with the Fire Spirit Formation.  That way, Isaac’s body will be preserved, we will obtain the Eternal Cold, and he will have the chance to revive anytime.”

The Fire Spirit Formation seemed to be a wise decision. If Isaac Morph were to resurrect as a dark mage, it was the only spell that could immediately counter him.

Queen Hong Seryu pondered for a long time and reached a conclusion.

“You want me to trust your distorted judgment again? Take her away.”

*Cheol-geo-duk!*  The knights put heavy magic shackles on Hong Seryu’s neck, arms, and ankles, then dragged her away, but she continued to convey her opinion to the queen until the end.

“It’s inevitable that you won’t believe my words, as I have no credibility. But please remember my lifelong wish.”

“We, our descendants, are destined to be born as descendants of Adolerebit, burdened with the curse, and have no choice but to suffer a short life in the flames. Your Majesty, do you truly believe this is right?”

“Can’t you just be quiet?!”  One of the knights, unable to bear it any longer, harshly pulled the shackles around Hong Sihwa’s neck to cut her off, but she wouldn’t stop. Until the end, she wished with all her heart that Hong Seryu would grant her request.

“Just being born as a descendant of Adolerebit, burdened by a curse, and having no choice but to face a short life in the pain of being burned, this wretched fate… if I can break it by soiling my hands… I’ll go to hell if I have to, I’ll become a devil.”

*Puk!*  Hong Sihwa finally fainted in the knight’s hand, leaving only the final words.  Hong Seryu, left alone, stared blankly at the distant horizon.

“The weather is quite foul…”  It was a clear day, with not a single cloud in the sky.
