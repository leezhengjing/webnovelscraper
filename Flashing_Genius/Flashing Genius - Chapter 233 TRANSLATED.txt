I Became a Genius at the Magic School's Frontline 233

48. The Start of the Semester (7)

No matter how often Stella's practical classes are attacked, not every episode is like that. This practical class, too, was not particularly significant, even in the original work. However, this episode served as a turning point in the original game, where traces of villains who would mainly appear in the second semester could be found. Dark magicians, necromancers, witches, and so on. These dark beings, characterized by their magical affiliations, each have unique hideouts. Dark magicians have the 'Black Tower.' Necromancers have 'Cemeteries or Dungeons.' Witches have 'Huts.' Of course, these characteristics are not absolute. There have been cases where witches built towers together, and dark magicians often create dungeons. However, their hideouts always have evidence that distinguishes their unique traits.

"Near the dungeon of a dark magician, you will often find decayed plants or animal carcasses, beasts driven mad by insanity..."

Baek Yuseol glanced around the environment with sleepy eyes, then turned his head to look at Flame, who was crouching in a corner, rummaging through something.

"What are you doing?"

"I found it. The dungeon entrance."

"Congratulations."

"Why is your reaction so lukewarm?"

Swoosh! The wind blew, rustling the leaves. It was unusually quiet. There were no common mountain bird sounds, no small animals rustling through the bushes, and even the insects had hidden away. How could it not be suspicious?

"The problem is too easy."

"Well, that's true."

A real dark magician wouldn't make it so obviously suspicious, so it was clear that the atmosphere was set up to match the students' level. But are all hideouts like that? Of course not. The hideouts targeting Class S would be hidden as thoroughly as possible, making them impossible to find. Naturally, Baek Yuseol had no intention of finding such things. Haewonryang would probably strive to get the highest score, Mayuseong would follow him around looking for something interesting, and Eisel and Hong Biyeon would fend for themselves. No, wait. Depending on the specific episode, Eisel might find something interesting in this practical class. But even that wouldn't lead to any immediate major events.

'...Boring.'

Nothing happened. It was just an ordinary practical class. Thinking that way, he felt a sudden release of tension. He never intended to take school classes seriously, but he still needed to earn his grades. It wasn't about getting expelled from Stella. What if he saved the world from destruction? If everything became peaceful and Baek Yuseol himself lived an ordinary life?

'When that time comes, how do you want to live, and with whom?'

Last night. Flame had casually asked that question. It was something Baek Yuseol had been thinking about consistently, but hearing it directly from someone else made his mind quite complicated.

"Come on, follow me. I'll make sure you get your share next time."

"Uh... okay."

For that reason, Flame was currently following Baek Yuseol around. She was helping him so that he wouldn't have to struggle alone at least in school, as he usually bore everything by himself.

"Come this way. The forest with the red maple leaves is out of sight of the professors. I'll find it for you, so just follow me."

A kind of system error. In the original romance novel, there was a setting called 'system error' to prevent the professors from catching Eisel and another sub-male lead having a sweet date during this practical class.

"...Is that so."

The swaying maple leaves in the wind had something that strangely stimulated people's emotions, but to Baek Yuseol, whose emotions had already dried up, they were just annoying leaves. He yawned widely and looked at Flame, who was walking ahead. She was smiling brightly, walking around as if she loved the maple leaves. He thought she was really young and full of energy.

'Hmm?'

Baek Yuseol, who was blankly staring at Flame's back, turned his head slightly at the presence he felt from behind. The presence quickly disappeared, but it couldn't fool Baek Yuseol's intuition.

'What now?'

Although the person had briefly exposed their presence, indicating they weren't a professional, the fact that he was being followed was enough to irritate Baek Yuseol.

'Originally, nothing should happen...'

He glanced at Flame. Yes, this episode should have nothing happen. That's normal. But has any 'episode' ever proceeded normally? They always twisted, distorted, and advanced, catching him off guard. This time could be the same.

'I was too complacent.'

Baek Yuseol quickened his pace to join Flame and spoke in a low voice.

"Someone's following us."

"...Really?"

She closed her mouth for a moment.

"That felt like a bodyguard scene from a spy movie, and it was a bit exciting."

"Stop talking nonsense."

He didn't know what was bothering him, but he had no intention of leaving the follower alone now that he had detected them.

"Go ahead. I'll check it out."

"No, I'll help this time. After all, this is Stella Dome."

"What if it's a dark magician? They can attack even in Stella Dome, you know?"

"I'll just shoot light from behind!"

"...Do as you please."

Thinking it wasn't a particularly dangerous opponent, Baek Yuseol nodded half-heartedly and took out his Terriphone. The Terriphone, which had been broken before, was repaired sturdily by Alterisha, so there was no problem using it. Baek Yuseol leaned close enough to Flame that his breath touched her ear and whispered quietly.

"Act like you haven't noticed the follower."

"Uh, okay. But, um..."

"What? Is there a problem?"

"No, it's not that..."

"Quiet. They're getting closer."

The wind stopped. The presence suddenly became clear, and as Baek Yuseol activated his Terriphone and turned around, considering it a signal to attack.

"You two. What are you doing?"

"...Huh?"

"...What?"

There stood not an enemy, but Pung Harang, with a stiff expression.

"What, what is this..."

Baek Yuseol, who hurriedly put away his Terriphone, asked in confusion, and Pung Harang's expression hardened even more.

"Why are you flustered?"

"Huh? No, I thought an enemy had appeared."

"Stella Dome is safe. Didn't the professors say they had thoroughly reinforced the system this time?"

"Well... I guess so."

Though the bug that prevented the scene of the red maple leaves from being transmitted to the professors seemed to remain.

"Just answer my question. Class S is supposed to act individually. But you two seem to be teaming up..."

Flame and Baek Yuseol looked at each other. They couldn't refute because it was true, so they just shrugged. If they let it go, Pung Harang would definitely report it to the professors, and they would receive a huge penalty.

"Sigh..."

As Baek Yuseol sighed, thinking about the penalty he would receive, Flame had no choice but to step forward and make an excuse.

"Hey, there seems to be a misunderstanding. It's not like that."

"...Not like that?"

"Yeah. Be honest. Who am I?"

"...Flame."

"It's me. The second in the grade, Flame. Do you think I would cheat?"

"Not you, but..."

"Then who is this?"

She pointed her thumb at Baek Yuseol. Without needing an answer, it was Baek Yuseol, so Pung Harang closed his mouth. Although his grades were not very high, being in the middle ranks... Baek Yuseol's name alone was enough to prove his worth. How many times had his name appeared in newspaper articles as a first-year student at Stella, and how many dark magicians had he hunted? Baek Yuseol, who had achieved greater feats than most magic warriors in actual combat... cheating?

"That doesn't make sense. Don't you think so?"

Reluctantly, Pung Harang nodded slowly, realizing he had to acknowledge it. He had to admit it. But there was still one last question. He didn't want to ask it, but he had to.

"Then... why were you together?"

At that, Flame glanced at Baek Yuseol and, thinking she had no choice but to use this excuse, blurted it out.

"Can't you see? We're secretly dating under the maple tree, you clueless guy."

"...Is that so."

"Yeah. So go your way. Do we look like we would cheat just to get some points?"

Baek Yuseol felt a pang of guilt, but Flame's brazen attitude made him maintain his own brazen demeanor.

"You're right. I apologize."

Admitting his mistake, Pung Harang slightly bowed his head in apology and disappeared among the maple trees. Why did his retreating figure feel so heavy and bitter?

* * *

The practical class ended. Haewonryang took first place with an overwhelming score. He found the 'Ancient Dungeon of the Dark Magician' that the professors had hidden, intending for it not to be found. Eisel took second place. She found the 'Witch's Hut,' which was also hidden to be hard to find, and reported something strange to the professors, but they dismissed it lightly. And third place went to... Pung Harang. Desperately searching for the dark beings' hideouts, he finally found the necromancer's hidden cemetery and detected the black mana, purifying the graves haunted by the spirits of the dead, earning a very high score. But why did he feel so unsatisfied?

'...Dating, huh.'

If Flame said it herself, it must be true. Baek Yuseol didn't deny it either. Moreover, as she said, those two didn't have the skills to cheat. They probably had better search abilities than him, yet their grades were just mediocre, barely in the top ten. Why was that? Naturally, because they didn't take the practical class seriously. He understood why they were like that. There had been rumors about Flame and Baek Yuseol dating in the first semester. But why did his emotions fluctuate this time when he hadn't cared much back then?

'Let it go.'

He understood his feelings clearly. The day he saw Flame flying with angel wings, he fell in love with her at first sight. He had tried to deny that feeling out of pride, but it was foolish and stubborn. It was true. He had a crush on her. But his father had said. Coveting a woman who already has a partner is the act of a scoundrel. Although his father hadn't achieved great things, he was the most respected person in Pung Harang's heart, and he had never gone against his father's will. Baek Yuseol and Flame had secretly reconciled and kept it a secret because they didn't want it to be known. If that was their wish, Pung Harang would respect it. He watched Flame and Baek Yuseol from a distance. While everyone else was gathered around the scoreboard checking their ranks, those two didn't seem to care about their scores and were just chatting.

"Hey, want to grab a meal after this?"

"You pay."

"You have a lot of money. Treat me."

"Beggar."

"Sigh, this sister will pay."

For now, he would give up because Baek Yuseol, a huge and overwhelming rival, was by her side. But if Baek Yuseol ever showed a gap and he got a chance... He wouldn't hesitate to seize it.
