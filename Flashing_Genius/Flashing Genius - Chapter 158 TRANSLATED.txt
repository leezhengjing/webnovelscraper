# I Became a Genius at Magic Academy
## Chapter 158: Orb of Souls (2)

The competition was reaching its climax, and the survival game, known as the 'TOP10', which was as tense as the finals of a tournament, had begun. The audience, caught up in the heated atmosphere, cheered loudly to support the top ten players. The players, in turn, had to showcase all their skills and magic to meet the expectations. However, unfortunately, this year's top ten players were not receiving any attention at all. 

All the audience's attention was focused on the battle between Bai Yuseol and the Black Demon. In fact, most of the screens installed in the stadium were broadcasting the battle between Bai Yuseol and the Black Demon instead of the top ten players' fights. The viewership was overwhelming. Had there ever been a battle that received this much attention?

- Boom! Boom!

Every time the black flames exploded on the screen, some people sighed, and others closed their eyes tightly. No one cheered. By now, everyone had realized that the fierce fight unfolding on the stage was real. For some reason, the match was not stopped, and the host was at a loss for words. It was an extremely unfair fight. It was possible for one side to inflict damage unilaterally. Moreover, the Black Demon seemed to be quite skilled, making it look like Bai Yuseol was slightly at a disadvantage. It seemed hopeless. Bai Yuseol, who was gradually being pushed back, seemed to be trying to respond by mobilizing artifacts, but effective hits were still impossible.

- Whoosh, Boom!

A fierce battle that traversed the earth and sky. The Black Demon had superior physical abilities compared to humans, allowing for agile movements, while Bai Yuseol freely traversed the 4-dimensional space using his teleportation technique. Although everyone was silent, they couldn't help but think that this was the most thrilling and exciting match they had ever seen. Other magic battles with powerful single strikes were certainly fun, but the fight between these two was far more interesting. Their battle, unrestricted by terrain and flying through space itself, was a rare sight that couldn't be seen anywhere else. Despite the dangerous situation where their lives could be at risk, the audience couldn't help but reach for their popcorn with sweaty hands.

The two fought in a highly three-dimensional manner, and the location kept changing. It seemed that Bai Yuseol, who could only be attacked unilaterally, was the first to get tired and tried to escape, but there were limits to that as well. Unfortunately, the place he arrived at was the edge of a cliff.

"Ah..."

"Damn it, why aren't they stopping the match immediately?"

"Isn't that really dangerous...?"

Around that time, people began to express their dissatisfaction directly. The player they were cheering for was really in danger of dying. The audience threw eggs, popcorn, and trash at the Stella officials, but the staff could only silently endure it without any reaction. Then, suddenly, the booing subsided.

"...Huh? Wait a minute."

"What's that...?"

Inside the stage, something like a white radiance was spreading high into the sky. Upon closer inspection, it was a thunderbolt. However, it was not just one, but hundreds... thousands of thunderbolts striking down. Every year, different natural disasters appeared in the competition, but the 'Curse of Hailges' had never appeared before, so the audience was overwhelmed by its tremendous majesty and overwhelming presentation. Even from a distance, just watching it made their legs tremble, but Bai Yuseol, with his back to the disaster, stood at the edge of the cliff and smiled at the Black Demon.

- Boom!!

A deafening roar and then silence. The disaster that occurred on the stage was so massive that it couldn't be conveyed to the audience, leaving only a screen that had turned completely white like a blank sheet of paper.

"Ah..."

Even though it was a moment when cheers should have erupted for successfully defeating the Black Demon, no one could speak for a long time. Truly, for a long time.

* * *

When the thought that the white color had covered the whole world suddenly came to mind, Berenkal closed his eyes tightly. It was a kind of instinct. To protect his corneas from the intensely burning light that seemed to scorch the entire world. To escape from the downpour of lightning that seemed to tear apart everything on the ground. When everything under the sky was covered in white, and he opened his eyes again.

"Ah...?"

He had been transported to the waiting room where the eliminated players of the survival game gathered. Berenkal looked around with dazed eyes.

"Black Demon Berenkal. You are surrounded."

Dozens of elite Stella magic warriors were pointing their staffs at him, looking at him with hostile eyes.

"Ah, damn..."

He tried to retreat, but there were also wizards behind him.

"Berenkal. You have no rights, no authority, and no right to speak."

"If you resist, you will die painfully. If you don't resist, you will die less painfully. The choice is yours, so make a wise decision."

"W-wait a minute... There seems to be some misunderstanding..."

Before becoming a Black Demon, Berenkal was actually an elite student. Although he was blocked by the wall of the 4th class and couldn't grow any further, he had always lived a life of being treated well wherever he went. He tried to use the prestige of his prestigious school to get out of the situation.

"Misunderstanding? I've never seen such a foolish Black Demon. Do you not realize your current state?"

"Ah...?"

Only then did Berenkal touch his forehead. The horn protruding sharply was clear evidence that he had chosen to become a Black Demon himself. If one was forcibly turned into a Black Demon, they could be purified and returned to society. However, a wizard who chose to become a Black Demon by contracting with the underworld was inevitably sentenced to death.

"Did you enjoy facing students in the Magic Survival? Then how about... enjoying it with us?"

The Stella magic warrior said, pointing his staff at Berenkal's neck.

The tumultuous school competition had ended. Naturally, Stella received tremendous protests. How could a Black Demon intrude during the match? This incident shattered Stella's pride. The main event of the school competition, which was like the biggest festival, was ruined by a Black Demon. Nevertheless, the award ceremony was held.

- Magic Survival, Winner: Raymel.
- Magic Survival, Runner-up: Samaran.

Great wizards from the Magic Association, including Stella's principal, Elteman Eltewin, the Elf King, and the Dwarf King, who were honored just to stand in front of, personally participated in the award ceremony. However, the expressions of the players receiving medals and trophies were not very bright. Despite winning, they received almost no attention. Throughout the Magic Survival, Bai Yuseol's one-man show unfolded, and he even defeated the Black Demon. Bai Yuseol could have escaped if he wanted to. But knowing that other players would surely be harmed, he held out until the end and finally chose to be eliminated together, allowing the other players to finish the match safely. Despite being the overwhelming favorite to win, he abandoned everything and fulfilled his duty as a magic warrior! It was no wonder that people said Bai Yuseol was the true winner of this competition.

Thus, when all the award ceremonies were over, his name was also called.

- Stella Cadet Bai Yuseol, Special Award.

At Elteman Eltewin's direct call, Bai Yuseol raised his head. He looked quite fine, having almost no aftereffects from the battle, and was able to attend the award ceremony immediately. However, his inner thoughts were different.

'Ugh, this is annoying...'

In fact, he had planned to use this incident as an excuse to be hospitalized for about a week. But since it happened in a virtual world, there were no injuries left. He was discharged immediately for the award ceremony and ended up receiving an unwanted award. Bai Yuseol had participated in the Magic Survival because he was interested in the rewards for the top ten. But unfortunately, he was recorded as exactly 11th place when he was eliminated simultaneously with Berenkal, so he couldn't even dream of the top ten rewards. Of course, a special award was prepared for him, but what was the point if he didn't get the reward he wanted?

"Sigh."

Receiving the attention of tens of thousands of spectators and hundreds of elites from thirty prestigious schools, Bai Yuseol trudged up to the podium. The podium, crafted from transparent magic glass, was unnecessarily beautiful, contrasting with Bai Yuseol's gloomy mood.

'Well, at least I saved a lot of people...'

Positive mindset. Positive mindset. Trying to think as positively as possible, he finally reached the podium, where Elteman Eltewin was waiting with a slightly sad but bright expression.

"Well done, Bai Yuseol. Thanks to you, it didn't turn into a big accident."

"I just did what I had to do."

At first glance, it seemed like a typical exchange of words, but at least for the two of them, it was sincere. Bai Yuseol genuinely didn't want other students to be harmed, and Elteman was truly grateful to him for preventing the incident from escalating. It was Elteman who hastily created the special award as an excuse for the audience. Of course, the process of creating the special award was not smooth. Although he defeated a Black Demon, which was a duty of a magic warrior, the association was somewhat reluctant. However, for some reason, the Elf King's aide, Orenha, actively supported Elteman's opinion, allowing the special award to be granted.

"Even though you're just a first-year, you've done better than I expected. I'm glad I met you that day."

The 'that day' Elteman referred to was probably the meeting with the 'past Bai Yuseol', not the current Bai Yuseol. Although the memories of that time kept trying to resurface in his mind, he tried to suppress them. He didn't want to recall the memories of another Bai Yuseol who wasn't himself.

"Please continue to do well."

After saying this in a small voice, Elteman then loudly declared with mana.

- The pride and glory of all wizards, and the place where magic is tested, was invaded by a Black Demon! However, our magic warriors did not yield and fought bravely in an unfair situation, proving their spirit as wizards!

Then all the spectators stood up, cheering and applauding. As the association said, it was natural for a magic warrior to defeat a Black Demon. But the situation was special. In the middle of the festival, Bai Yuseol sacrificed his own match to ensure the safety of his competitors, even though he could have escaped. Moreover, he was the youngest participant in the Magic Survival. If this wasn't special, what was?

- Therefore, I will award a special prize to Cadet Bai Yuseol! Everyone, stand up and welcome him with applause!

The cheers were even louder than during the winner's award ceremony, and the expressions of the students receiving medals hardened as if they had chewed on something bitter. Bai Yuseol, who had been receiving the award with an indifferent expression, was surprised by the outpouring of cheers. He hadn't expected such an intense reaction. For someone who had lived an ordinary life, this kind of reaction was quite unfamiliar and awkward.

'Hmm... well, it's not a bad feeling.'

The hospitality itself wasn't a bad feeling. He waved his hand to the audience in response, and the cheers grew even louder. Finally, as Elteman was about to place the medal around his neck.

"...Wait."

Someone who had approached Elteman's side at some point stopped him. It was Orenha, the Elf King's aide. Seeing his face, Elteman Eltewin stopped his hand with a hardened expression, and as the situation began to take a strange turn, the cheers gradually subsided. Orenha glanced around the audience and then fixed his gaze on Bai Yuseol. Then he spoke abruptly.

"Today, Cadet Bai Yuseol's achievements were undoubtedly remarkable. Despite his young age, he showed the spirit of a magic warrior, making me admire Stella's excellent educational policy once again."

After a brief pause, he continued, addressing Eltewin.

"However, our elf race questions his identity."

As soon as those words were spoken, most wizards anticipated what Orenha would say next. But Elteman, trying to remain as calm as possible, asked in a composed tone.

"...Question? Did you say question?"

"Yes! I wonder why wizards do not question his identity. Because, from him..."

Orenha snapped his fingers, and a light orb formed in the air, followed by small, translucent fairies that began to circle around. The fairies sprinkled white powder on Bai Yuseol, and the powder that touched his body turned golden and spread brilliantly. At first glance, it looked like fireworks for celebration, but the golden powder signified the 'aura of a divine beast'. Only then did some wizards realize the meaning of Orenha's words and were shocked.

"No way..."

"With such a strong aura of a divine beast..."

"Is he a divine beast slayer...?"

Humans could never possess such a dense aura of a divine beast. Even if they contracted with a high-ranking divine beast, they couldn't erase the unique scent of human magic. But there was one way. 'Consuming the heart of a divine beast.' Although it came with the curse of being a divine beast slayer, the wizard who consumed the heart would gain immense longevity and the abilities of the divine beast.

"What the..."

Realizing this, Elteman shouted in bewilderment.

"Stop! There's no evidence yet! A divine beast slayer would have a tainted soul with an aura comparable to a Black Demon, so how could it go unnoticed?"

Orenha smirked.

"That's... didn't you see it too, Principal? Black Demons can now hide their magic, and their skills are advanced enough to deceive even you."

Elteman, who had been hit where it hurt, widened his eyes. He glared at Orenha with his mana, but he couldn't stop him from speaking. Doing so would only increase the controversy surrounding Bai Yuseol. Orenha subtly turned his head to look at his king. 'Why...!' Hwaserin was looking at this place with both hands covering her mouth in great surprise. This wasn't the development she wanted, but it couldn't be helped. Stella needed to be suppressed politically at least once. Besides, Elteman Eltewin was not to her liking. That disgusting human dared to approach his woman under the guise of friendly diplomacy and often had private meetings with her, which was very annoying. 'Elves are enough for elves.' It would be better if they could cut ties with humans and live in harmony among themselves in the forest again.

"Really? Bai Yuseol is a divine beast slayer?"

"I can't believe it..."

"But wasn't it a bit strange?"

"Yeah. He had too many achievements for his age. It's like an old person pretending to be young..."

"I personally think it's true. This is a chance to reveal his identity."

As the audience and wizards began to murmur, Orenha paused for a moment. It was to fuel their suspicions. And when it reached its peak, Elteman spoke urgently.

"This won't do any good. As I said earlier, it's not just me but also the elves who can't distinguish Black Demons. On what grounds are you accusing a cadet of being a Black Demon?"

Accusing a wizard of being a Black Demon without reason was a serious act that greatly damaged the person's honor and was strictly prohibited. Therefore, Elteman couldn't understand Orenha's reckless behavior at all. At that moment, something suddenly came to his mind. 'No way...!' And as if to confirm his suspicion, Orenha smiled and shouted.

"Grounds. That's a good point. Unlike human wizards, elves have a special ability to discern the soul of a target. And we have implanted the treasure 'Orb of Souls' in Cadet Bai Yuseol's body."

At that point, Elteman could no longer say anything. Meanwhile, Orenha, who was still looking at Bai Yuseol without any excuses, spoke.

"If you are innocent as Principal Elteman said... the Orb of Souls will emit a clear light. Conversely, if you have a tainted soul, it will be deeply stained."

He pointed his index finger at Bai Yuseol's chest.

"Now... why don't you take out that pendant around your neck?"

Bai Yuseol silently lowered his head, took off his necklace, and opened the pendant. Click! He opened it, revealing the item inside.

"See! You are indeed a Black... huh?"

Orenha, who was about to shout with a triumphant expression, stopped speaking at the sight of the light bursting out. The light was so dazzling that ordinary people had to raise their hands to shield their eyes. It was proof that Bai Yuseol possessed a pure and white soul, similar to that of a divine being or an angel.
