## Chapter 286: Shadows Cast By the Wind (7)

The capital of the Wind Empire, Taiyu Mountain. Even in this place, where people rarely tread, a swirling vortex of air manifested in a shadowy alleyway, spewing forth over ten boys and girls. They were the first-year students of Stella, fresh from returning through the Persona Gate.

“Whew, this field trip was crazy…,” Pan Diyan, finally relaxing after exiting the gate, shook her hair loose and fanned herself with her hand. The sweat dripping down her neck revealed the tension she'd been under. She turned around to check the headcount of the first-year students, making sure everyone had made it out safely. 

“Total of 12 students, all present. ‘I thought something terrible had happened… The mission itself was extremely ordinary, just a 3-risk Persona Gate. There were no variables, and it was actually on the easier side of 3-risk gates. But the ending was the problem.’  ‘A human…’, ” Pan Diyan thought to herself.

One of the girls was asleep, being carried on Bai Yueshu's back. She looked like a middle school student, cute and innocent. This girl was actually a real person discovered inside the Persona Gate and, incredibly, was acquainted with Bai Yueshu. It was shocking enough to find a real person as the boss monster within the Persona Gate, but it was even more surprising that they knew each other.

“Uh, Senior,” a first-year student stammered, approaching Pan Diyan with a trembling voice.

“Yes, what is it?”

“We… we almost killed a real person…”

Pan Diyan softened her expression and approached the student.

“It's okay, calm down and listen.”

“Yes?”

“It's not your fault. This isn't just a comforting word.”

“That… ”

“To be honest, I was a little surprised too, but this isn't unheard of.” 

“What?”

It wasn't included in the textbooks, so they wouldn't know, but this type of situation wasn't unheard of.  Pan Diyan thought,  ‘While I've never heard of a case where someone who wasn't even inside the gate was found, there have been stories of teammates becoming fully consumed by Personas and appearing as boss monsters.’  Every time, the mages had to shed tears of blood and kill their own teammates with their own hands, leaving deep scars on their hearts.

“Persona Gates are notoriously difficult to conquer, but they're famous for their enormous rewards. Besides, the Mage Association gives the most credit for them. Do you know why?”

“I… I don't know, Senior.” 

“It's because of the mental stress. Monster hunting and Dark Mage hunting are never easy, but why does the Association acknowledge Persona Gates?  Why do senior mages avoid them despite such high rewards? Ever thought about it?”

When the junior shook their head, Pan Diyan patted their shoulder and said, “It's because it's not your body that's suffering, it's your mind.”

“...Is it a frequent occurrence?”

Pan Diyan shook her head. “Not really. But besides this, there are many more elements in Persona Gates that torture us mentally, in various ways. That's why it's so difficult.”

Persona Gates forced mages to directly enter a ‘story’ with artificial content, become characters, and move within it. Countless mages suffered injuries and mental stress, even quitting because of this. It was not for nothing that there was a separate position called ‘Persona Hunter’. 

“I'm going to the hospital first.”

“Okay. I'll take care of the grading.  Go ahead.”

Pan Diyan watched as Bai Yueshu, carrying Annella, rushed towards an unknown destination.  It was unfortunate that she hadn't seen him move properly during this mission. But, perhaps, it was a good thing.  Whenever Bai Yueshu really started moving, it meant something serious had happened.

“Something seems off.”

“What? What’s off?” Liuderick said, frowning.

“That guy is not ordinary. I kept following him at a distance, but he was moving at a speed exceeding a professional Persona Hunter. I still don't know why he kept circling back instead of going to the final destination, but he's a curious fellow.”

Pan Diyan snorted at Liuderick, who was speaking as if he had discovered some profound secret. 

“Of course he is.”

“...Are you questioning my judgment? That guy is absolutely not an ordinary first-year-”

“Yeah, you're right.”

“Hey!”

Pan Diyan, having responded vaguely, led the first-year students out of the alley.  The mission had ended three days earlier than expected, unlike the anticipated week, so spending a day or two sightseeing wouldn't hurt.

The scent of blooming flowers carried by the gentle breeze on the hilltop.  Annella caught her swaying hair with one hand, savoring the fragrance. In the distance, she could see her mother in a white dress, waving her hand.  “Annella, come eat.”

In her childhood, their home was small and shabby, but a happy family nonetheless.  Although her father wasn't around, her mother was a strong woman who faced the world alone.  The villagers loved her, too. 

‘The Valkamik Kingdom’  A kingdom established by one of the descendants of the twelve disciples of the founding mage.  It was said to have flourished immensely in the distant past, but now it was just a small country tucked away in a corner. 

But what did it matter whether the country was big or small?  Yesterday’s self was happy, today’s self is happy, and tomorrow’s self will be happy too.  Annella had never doubted that she would live this way forever.  Holding her mother's hand, she would live a beautiful life without lacking anything, even if it wasn't opulent.  She believed that she would grow up like that.

‘Mom, M-……?’

The whole world was painted red.  Even the sky screamed that night.  The small house that protected Annella and her mother’s happiness was engulfed in flames, crumbling completely.  It was no longer a place of happiness.  Instead, it became a shackle, inviting her mother’s misfortune.

‘Annella…’.

Had an old pillar broken and fallen?  Her mother, half her body trapped under the rubble, groaned in pain and reached out to Annella.

‘Annella, remember this. Run, and don't look back.’ 

‘Mom, Mom is…!’

‘Mom will follow soon, so hurry!’

‘U, Ugh…!’

It was the first time Annella had ever seen her mother screaming.  She got up abruptly from her spot, tears welling up in her eyes. 

‘Hurry, hurry and run away…’.

Stupidly, Annella must have been holding back tears that day.  She can't remember her mother's final plea. Her blurred vision, stained with tears, makes it impossible to tell if her mother was smiling or crying at that moment.

Annella turned and ran away. 

The invasion of the Dark Mage, Black Kingdun.  The collapse of the Valkamik Royal Family. 

She ran and ran.  To be a good child who obeyed her mother's last words until the very end.  …To survive.

When Annella opened her eyes again, tears glistened in their corners.  Why did the memory of that day suddenly resurface?  After becoming a Dark Mage, she had completely forgotten, buried it deep inside.  She had sealed it away with her powers, determined to never recall it.

“Ah…”, she whispered.

A pure white ceiling.  The lighting, dimmed to avoid glare, flickered slightly.  The sunlight outside swayed gently.  Annella closed and reopened her eyes several times, then cautiously strained her upper body. Her waist was severely strained, making it impossible for her to get up.  Moving was uncomfortable, as if she hadn't used her muscles in a long time.

“Ugh…”

A wave of weakness washed over her entire body, and she fell back onto the bed, sprawled out in a large ‘X’. Annella felt an immediate sense of unease. ‘Huh? A bed?’

When was the last time she slept in a bed?  It was during her summer infiltration as a Stella exchange student, the first and last time.  Although not as plush as the bed in the Stella exchange student dormitory, this one was comfortable enough.  Perhaps it was even more reassuring than the one back then.

“Uuuugh…”

Confused by the situation, Annella hastily tried to get up.  She pushed with all her might, but managed to only sit up. With great effort, she managed to swing her legs over the side and stand.

Thud!

The door creaked open, and a nurse came in.

“Ah, patient! You're not supposed to be walking around yet! You've got magic exhaustion, so lie down!”

“Huh? Magic exhaustion? Ugh!” Annella, who had finally gotten up, was cruelly shoved back onto the bed by the nurse.  She had spent all her strength getting up, so she felt like she would never be able to move again.

Annella, who was becoming increasingly gloomy, buried her face in the pillow. The nurse approached her, raising her arm to take her temperature, then attached some kind of device to her forehead to send signals.  She just wouldn’t stop bothering Annella, so she finally lifted her head.

“What’s going on…?”  She was about to shout, but when her eyes met the nurse's terrifying gaze, her heart shrank.

“What’s going on? Don't you remember fainting? Your friends said you overexerted yourself with magic and suffered magic exhaustion. You can't do that.  What if you permanently lose your ability to use magic?”

“...What's magic exhaustion?”

“You call yourself a magic warrior and don't even know that? It happens when you completely deplete your mana, even the minimal amount needed to move your body. It's dangerous, so be careful.”

“Wait, wait a minute.”

This was ridiculous.  Annella was not a mage. She was a Dark Mage, so she shouldn't have magic exhaustion.  No matter how much she used Dark Mage Control, she couldn't artificially manipulate something as detailed as magic exhaustion, a phenomenon that only affects mages.  But… This nurse was talking as if she assumed Annella was a human mage.

“Magic exhaustion, in my body?”

“Yes.”

“That's a lie.”

The nurse pursed her lips and shook her head. “The director himself examined you. It's no use even if you say it's a lie.  Do you think the doctors at Fengling University Hospital are wrong?” 

“Huh?  Feng, Fengling University?  Could it be…?”

“That's right. Fengling University Hospital.”

“Holy crap…”

Fengling University was undoubtedly one of the most prestigious medical schools in the world.  Not to mention, Annella couldn't even afford to be anywhere near it.  Fengling University Hospital was the best in the Wind Empire. The director's statement was highly unlikely to be wrong.

“If it was another patient, the director wouldn't just let it go.  You're a special guest of the Star Cloud Trading Company, so… Well, it’s possible.”

Annella was completely lost.  Why was the Star Cloud Trading Company's name being mentioned here?

“Now, stay put.”

The nurse attached various things to Annella's body, such as bandages and electrodes, to perform various tests before finally leaving the room.  Annella stared at the closed door with a dazed expression, then suddenly placed her hand on her chest.

Thump, thump!

‘…Huh?’

It was gone.  The Black Kingdun's dark magic that had been constricting her heart.  Whenever it wanted, it could have exploded and shattered Annella’s heart, the seed of the Dark Mage.  … It was gone, completely gone.

‘How is this possible?!’

She couldn’t feel any dark magic in her body.  Even her unique ability, which usually burrowed into people's hearts and triggered their trauma, wasn't activating.  She clenched and unclenched her fists, punching the air, but there was no terrifying power, just the weak flailing of a delicate teenage girl.

Her powers, her strength, had completely disappeared.  Instead…

All the black mana that had been suppressing her freedom was gone, and pure blue mana flowed in her heart.

“I, I really…”

Thud!

As Annella stared blankly at the air with trembling eyes, the door to the ward opened again. This time, it wasn't the nurse, but Bai Yueshu.  He held something like a chart in one hand, and he was smiling brightly, seemingly in a good mood. 

“You’re awake.”

“B, Bai Yueshu…”

“I skimmed through it, and you’re completely human now. All the complex suppression and control techniques engraved in your heart have been lifted.  Naturally, the seed is gone.”

“It’s… gone…?”

“Your body age is about sixteen to seventeen.  I don't know your real age, but it's good news. You've gotten younger.”

“S, Sixteen? I'm not that young…”

“It's just your physical age. You need to exercise.  Your muscles are in bad shape.  Your mana is almost at the level of a normal person.  You won't need to start from scratch. You can quickly master white magic by using your experience of freely manipulating dark magic as a foundation. Consider yourself lucky.  Because you became a Dark Mage and then became human again, your body has been blessed with [Mana Blessings].  And also…”

Bai Yueshu started explaining various things as he flipped through the chart, but Annella couldn't hear him properly. 

‘Human, I’m human…?, Is this real?  Am I dreaming?  It's such a blissful dream that Black Kingdun is going to wake me up right now, threaten to strangle my heart, and kill me? ’

A sudden fear welled up within her, and she slapped her cheek hard.

Smack!

“Ouch!”  It hurt.  Tears welled up in her eyes.  But that wasn’t enough. She raised her other arm and tried to slap herself again, but her hand trembled with fear of the pain.

“...What are you doing? Want me to hit you instead?”

Bai Yueshu looked at her as if she were an idiot, and Annella nodded vigorously.  She closed her eyes tightly as he chuckled and approached, anticipating the impact on her cheek.  But instead of swinging his hand, he placed his palm on her head.  Not gently stroking her, but placing it on her head like he was putting down an object.

“Huh?”

“It's not a dream.”  Bai Yueshu grabbed Annella's head like a basketball and gently shook it from side to side.  “Congratulations.  You're truly human now.”

“Th, Thank you.  Thanks to you…”

“No, I didn't do anything.  I just talked a big game, but in the end, you’re the one who made this happen. You’re the one who hardened your heart.”

“Still…”

“You're completely free from Black Kingdun now.  You're free. How do you feel?”

Annella turned her head and stared out the window, silently pondering Bai Yueshu’s question.  “Ah…  It must be the same scenery as yesterday, but the sky seems exceptionally clear and bright today.  Something beautiful is standing out more than usual, and even the smallest details look pretty. This is the human perspective on the world.  A warm feeling I haven't felt in a long time.”

“Happy…”, she murmured involuntarily.

Bai Yueshu, hearing her words, smiled.  “I'm glad.  You’re happy.”

Then, before Annella could fully bask in her happiness, he pulled a manila envelope from his bag.

“If you're happy, you’ll have to suffer a bit now.”

“Huh?  What?”

“It’s a special application form for Stella.  They don't just give them out to anyone.  This opportunity only arose once, but… You have to become a Stella student now.  Or, you have to gain the ability to be worthy of it.”

“W, Why?”

“Are you going to stay like this?  You've become human.  You can't just live the same way as before.  And your boss won’t leave you alone. It's best to be under Stella's protection for now. Well, it does have holes here and there.”

Annella stared blankly at the application form handed to her.

“Can I… really do that?”

“What, do you think you can't?  You're human just like me, an ordinary commoner. Stella is an equal opportunity school.  Anyone can enroll as long as they have the ability.”

Ordinary human.  The resonance of those words was so moving that Annella almost burst into tears. 

“Yes! I'll do my best!”

“Don't try your best, just do well.”

“Okay!”

Annella hugged the manila envelope Bai Yueshu had given her.  She thought that becoming human and living as a human was the ultimate destination.  But the destination wasn't an ending, but a new beginning.  ‘Enroll in Stella.’  A new direction in life was decided.  Not as a Dark Mage, but as a human.  The first goal of her life.
