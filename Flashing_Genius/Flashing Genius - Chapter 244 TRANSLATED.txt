# I Became a Genius in the Magic School's Frontline Teleportation

## Chapter 244: Witch (11)

**Arcanium, Kanadan Academic District.**

Boom!!

The sudden, earth-shaking roar caused the students wandering the streets after school to scream and collapse in fear.

"Kyahhh!!"

"Is it an earthquake?!"

"Ahhh!"

It was natural to think of an earthquake when the ground shook, but this was Arcanium, a floating city. Natural earthquakes do not occur here.

"How noisy~"

Watching the scene from the top of a building, Heijin whistled. At the same time, a question arose.

"Is it really a witch?"

Witches do not fight in such a noisy manner. Handling illusions means they hardly affect reality, so they fought quietly without leaving any traces.

"Moreover, that..."

Heijin frowned as he looked at the translucent glass-like fragments rising in the center of Arcanium. The shattered space fragments, as if cracks had formed in the air, created a kind of barrier, preventing the Arcanium Magic Guard, who arrived late, from entering.

"No matter how you look at it, it doesn't seem like illusion magic."

But it was definitely illusion magic. Heijin, who was more proficient in illusion magic than anyone else, could tell. That made it even more suspicious and intriguing.

"An illusion that affects reality. Is that what it feels like to reach the pinnacle of a witch? It must be incredibly powerful."

- No. It's completely different.

"Huh?"

At that moment, a voice was heard from somewhere, and both Kaen and Heijin turned their heads to look at the air. There, a translucent red sparrow was flapping its wings.

"Metler..."

- Yes, it's me.

Heijin slightly furrowed his brows and looked at the red sparrow illusion. Its official name was 'Psychometer,' a special ability to read the memories of objects. He was a wizard and operator belonging to the Tower of Sakwol. He received missions from the tower master at the headquarters and relayed them to agents, designed operations, handled post-processing, and supplies, usually sending illusions to receive situation reports.

"You're busy. What brings you here?"

- It seems the mission is not going smoothly, so I came to check the situation myself.

"What about Cheonrian?"

- I had to work overtime because there was a target that needed intensive surveillance for the past few days. The target had dimension-shifting abilities, which was quite a headache.

"Good grief..."

Heijin scratched his cheek and said, "So, what do you mean by different? Are you saying that's not illusion magic?"

- It is illusion magic. But, Heijin, you know what happens when you reach the pinnacle of illusion magic, right?

She nodded and looked at the brilliant glass pillar fragments caused by the unidentified witch.

'An illusion at the pinnacle of a witch is indistinguishable from reality.'

Metler spoke softly.

- So, what do you think? Do you think it's indistinguishable?

"Well... it seems real, but if you look closely, an illusion is still an illusion, right?"

- Yes.

"Indeed, illusions don't work like that."

Heijin mainly used magic that applied illusions to the opponent's body, which was the most basic way for a witch to use magic. Making the opponent's body feel heavy or summoning a giant dinosaur visible only to the target to make them faint. Such illusions did not affect reality at all but could have an unlimited impact on the target.

However, the magic of the witch causing the commotion in Arcanium had a very different nature.

- That is... an illusion magic that affects reality.

"...No way. That can't be."

Heijin shook her head in disbelief.

"That's the ultimate illusion magic. It should have completely disappeared after the last witch vanished..."

- That's why I'm also surprised. I can't believe something like that exists.

She recalled the magic she knew with a bewildered expression.

'An illusion indistinguishable from reality.'

And one step above that.

'An illusion that affects reality.'

Oh my god. She looked at the scene unfolding before her eyes with an incredulous expression.

"That legendary witch is alive...?"

Then Kaen shook his head.

"It doesn't seem like that. Look closely. Does that level of magic look like the last witch's magic to you?"

"Huh? Uh?"

Heijin squinted her eyes and carefully examined the illusion barrier. The magic that interfered with reality was certainly impressive, but if asked whether it was high-level, the answer would be no. At best, it was similar to or slightly higher than her own level. It was laughable to think it was the last witch's magic.

"Probably a descendant or a hidden disciple of the last witch."

"Ah..."

Finally understanding the situation, Heijin exhaled excitedly. It was her first time encountering a witch, and even more so, a descendant of the last witch.

"This is getting... more exciting. I want to meet them soon..."

Unlike the excited Heijin, Kaen had a slightly negative thought.

'An abnormal ability.'

An illusion that can interfere with reality. How is it different from 'reality manipulation'? Wouldn't such an ability come with a price?

When considering only the magic system, the space series, which seemed like a cheat, had the disadvantage of being almost impossible to cast purely by magic, requiring multiple high-class wizards or carrying a magic book for direct notation. The fire series, with the most destructive power, had the drawback of being difficult for the caster to control its form, and the water series was less effective in places without water. Every attribute had its weaknesses.

So, what are the limitations of illusion magic?

"The priority is to break into that barrier. Have you found a way, Metler?"

- Sorry, Kaen. Not yet. The wizards at the headquarters are analyzing the magic circle as much as possible, but it's not easy because it's a witch's magic. Heijin, how about you?

"Huh? Well~?"

Heijin tilted her head. Honestly, although she used witch's magic, it was her first time seeing another witch's magic, so she couldn't tell what was what.

'How do I break that...'

It was a higher-dimensional magic circle, one step more advanced than her own magic. With her current knowledge... no matter how much she thought, she couldn't come up with a way to break it.

"I can't see a solution... it's frustrating. The witch is right in front of me, but I can't even approach."

- As you know, there's a high probability that Baek Yuseol is fighting inside that barrier.

"Ugh."

- I don't know much about illusion magic, but I think even Baek Yuseol would struggle to withstand the last witch's magic.

So, they had to break into the barrier as soon as possible and join the battle against the witch, but they couldn't, which was frustrating.

"Then how..."

"Who are you?"

Swoosh!

Just as Heijin was about to sigh, Kaen suddenly pointed his staff somewhere and summoned a spike, shooting it out.

"What, what?!"

Heijin, who had taken a step back belatedly, held her staff and discovered the uninvited guests who had come from behind. Two girls. Despite the spike stopping just 0.1 millimeters from their eyes, they looked at them with calm expressions, faces familiar to Heijin.

"Uh, uh? Aren't they those girls?"

- Kaen, stop. Don't touch those two kids.

"Flame and Angel. Special girls born with the fate of the stars."

However, Kaen did not withdraw the spike and asked.

"What brings you here?"

Kaen and Heijin moved without leaving any traces. It was impossible for mere students to find their location. Moreover, with space and perception distorted, ordinary people couldn't even look at or enter this place, so it couldn't be explained as a coincidence.

In other words, those two girls had a purpose and broke through their barrier to get here.

"Nice to meet you. You know me, right?"

"...Yes. I've seen your face before."

"I know you too."

"What?"

At Flame's words, Kaen frowned. He had left no traces of his identity, name, or anything, so he should be recorded as a dead person. How could a mere high school girl know about him?

"You know me?"

"Yes. You're a wizard of the Tower of Sakwol."

At those words, Kaen's eyebrows twitched, and Heijin's expression stiffened with a smile. Meanwhile, Metler, through the red sparrow, spoke with a tone full of amusement.

- Wow, this is a bit surprising. I thought they weren't ordinary, but to think they know about the Tower of Sakwol.

"You..."

- Kaen, you're not planning to kill them for knowing too much, are you? Don't do that.

"...I wasn't planning to."

- Well, I understand. Recently, I heard that Baek Yuseol is in a relationship with one of them.

At Metler's words, Flame's expression turned strange, and Angel's face crumpled, but he didn't care.

- Moreover, like Baek Yuseol, or perhaps even more special, those two kids are also extraordinary... so there's no need to be surprised by such trivial things, right?

Convinced by Metler's persuasion, Kaen nodded. Metler's judgment had never been wrong, so the choice to spare those girls must be correct.

When Kaen withdrew his staff, Metler moved the red sparrow closer to the girls and asked.

- Hello? I'm Metler. So, what brings you here?

"We want to help."

Angel stepped forward and said.

- Help? What kind of help?

"I know how to break that illusion barrier."

- ...Really?

"Yes. But... we need help because we can't do it alone."

Flame definitely knew the method. However, it required a lot of equipment and very high-level complex magic, so the help of the Tower of Sakwol was essential.

- Help...

Metler tilted the sparrow's head and thought for a moment. Flame swallowed dryly. She knew from the original novel that the agents of the Tower of Sakwol were here. However, there was no mention of directly facing them, so from here on, she was completely in the dark. If something went wrong and they were killed by the agents of the Tower of Sakwol, she couldn't complain. They were that dangerous.

- Alright.

Fortunately, Metler's concern was not about dealing with Flame and Angel.

- Actually, I was wondering if we were helping or being helped. Let's say we're helping each other. Is that okay?

"...Is that so?"

- Huh? What's wrong? I think this part is quite important.

Angel sighed and shook her head at Metler's words, which were quite different from those of ordinary people. Whatever. They finally found a way to help Baek Yuseol.

- Alright. Let's get started right away.

* * *

Crash!

The wall crumbled and scattered into the air like flowers. However, they were actually hundreds of blade fragments. Even a single touch would cause serious injury.

'This is dangerous... [Blink]'

Quickly leaping into the air, Baek Yuseol swung his sword. The invisible waves in the air split, revealing a gap, but Melisher shot a translucent space spike through it.

Crash!

It shattered upon contact with Baek Yuseol's blade, but his wrist swelled painfully.

Boom! Boom!!

The collapsing ceiling. Dodging the pillars, rubble, and glass space fragments, Baek Yuseol tried to gain the high ground.

"Haha... I get it. Your blink has limits, right?"

Melisher raised her trembling lips. Her mana had long been exhausted. Even her concentration had waned, making it difficult to use proper magic, but she couldn't lose to a mere student who hadn't even lived for 20 years.

'Blink, it's certainly unique.'

That ability to instantly traverse space was an incomplete magic that no wizard in the world had ever conquered. At first, she was quite flustered, but it seemed there were limits to controlling blink.

"If not, you wouldn't need to dodge or barely block. Right?"

If he could use blink indefinitely, he could nullify all attacks with teleportation and approach to stab with his blade. At the very least, he could have used other magic.

But that 'peculiar constitution's limit was unavoidable. He didn't use any magic. No, he couldn't.

'His only means of attack is the sword. As long as I watch out for that, I'm fine.'

She kept a distance of at least 15 meters, breaking down the space. Or more precisely... she was breaking down the illusion that made up the entire space.

'An illusion that affects reality.'

She understood clearly. Illusions had no effect on Baek Yuseol. None of the mental magic she used worked on him. But what about the magic left by the last witch? Could he escape from the great magic of the last witch that even affected reality?

'The last witch. You were wrong.'

She couldn't believe that there was someone she feared despite having such a perfect ability. Perhaps the last witch was just a great pioneer who discovered new magic, but not an outstanding person. Or maybe... she was better than the last witch!

When she struck the ground with her staff, trees sprouted from the floor. Baek Yuseol dodged with a light backstep, but human hands suddenly grew from the branches, spreading out in dozens of directions to bind him.

Slash!

The illusion was easily cut by his swordsmanship, but from the cut position, an anaconda's head emerged and bit Baek Yuseol's shoulder.

Crunch!

The pain was enough to make him lose consciousness, but he swung his sword without any change in expression, beheading the anaconda and charging forward.

"Hah, can you keep using such a brute method even if the damage accumulates?"

He was a fool with no strategy. Click! Boom!!

"Ugh!"

Occasionally, he threw strange magic tools to dispel the illusion or scattered the illusion like dust with a fan, almost causing danger, but it didn't matter. She had anticipated all such variables!

"Just die already!"

The water from the underground sewer surged up, forming a giant dragon that rushed at Baek Yuseol, and trains burst out from both walls, crashing into his body. He dodged or cut them down with his sword each time, but he couldn't block all the damage.

"Cough..."

Her mana was running low. But it was fine. Baek Yuseol would collapse from exhaustion before she reached her limit. He was already heavily injured and exhausted, while she had only lost mana. It was obvious who had the advantage without even measuring...

'...Huh?'

But something was strange.

'Where are the wounds?'

Baek Yuseol's shoulder should have been crushed by the anaconda's bite earlier. But there were no wounds.

'No, that can't be.'

Illusions had no direct effect on him. So, she changed her combat style to use illusions that affected reality. Didn't he dodge or block the attacks? If illusions didn't work, he wouldn't have bothered with such troublesome actions.

But Baek Yuseol didn't seem tired at all.

'...What's going on?'

The witch's mind went blank.
