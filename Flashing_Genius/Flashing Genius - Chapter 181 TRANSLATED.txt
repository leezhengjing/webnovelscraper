### Chapter 181: Unreal (5)

Despite the appearance of an unbeatable monster, Flame's daily life did not change. Instead, she continued to strive and work hard in her own way. Unable to strengthen her magic further, she learned how to combine it, analyzed the patterns and appearances of the monsters, and formed a scientific team to identify their weaknesses.

She no longer thought about her daily life. Her daily life was now about killing the monsters that began to appear incessantly and protecting the world.

"…Flame?"

"Ah."

"It seems you dozed off for a moment. We've arrived. Shall we proceed with the operation?"

"Yes, please go ahead."

Traveling around the world, Flame constantly hunted monsters. She achieved some results. With the help of science, she could defeat monsters that were difficult to handle and hunt them more efficiently and quickly. She also did not forget to provide part of her magic to scientific institutions for research. For the advancement of the world, she was willing to reveal her magic.

However, the research on magic made no progress. Even the world's top scientists, wearing glasses and diving into the research, could not understand it at all. It was as if the world was saying that magic was solely the domain of Flame.

The more this happened, the harder she worked. She fought and fought, reducing even her sleeping time. And so… a year passed.

– Two days ago, a monster appeared in Vilnius, Lithuania.
– The ecosystem is being destroyed due to a herd of monster bulls occupying the Tibetan Plateau…
– The monster that appeared in Peru's Colca Valley has the ability to manipulate the climate, causing abnormal temperatures on Earth…
– The monster that appeared in Moscow, Russia, is spewing lava. The city center is already in ruins…

No matter how hard she tried, no matter how much she pushed herself to the limit, some things were just impossible. Protecting the entire world alone was something that only happened in movies. When she realized that her efforts were in vain, an overwhelming sense of emptiness engulfed her.

"Flame? Are you okay?"

"…Yes. Where is the next destination?"

"Please decide. Currently, monsters have appeared in fifteen places."

Now, the simultaneous appearance of double-digit monsters was a daily occurrence. She had only one body and could only save one place. The rest would be abandoned based on her decision here.

So, she had to choose as efficiently as possible. She had to select places where she could defeat the monsters even if it meant turning the city into ruins with missiles, and places where she couldn't.

She was getting more and more exhausted. Suddenly, a thought crossed her mind.

'You have to choose death yourself.'

She shook her head hastily.

'No, that can't be.'

She didn't want to give up this life. She was still happy. Saving the world while receiving everyone's expectations was her duty. If she continued to work hard, she would surely lead this world to peace.

…Bai Yuseol came to her that night.

* * *

If one were to name the trendiest city in the world, it would undoubtedly be New York. A city where people from all over the world gather, where past and present cultures coexist, always bustling with tourists, and where neon signs glitter 24 hours a day.

However, today's New York was dead. It was due to the monster appearance alert.

Flame stepped into such a New York. The streets, which were always bustling, were now eerily quiet. Seeing the dead streets, she suddenly remembered a dream she had a year ago.

'Get a grip.'

There was a monster here, so she couldn't afford to be careless.

But then.

"What…?"

The monster was dead. Seeing the massive creature, resembling a dog, lying cold, Flame instinctively looked for someone.

"…Bai Yuseol."

On the opposite side of the street, there was that boy. Today, he had a complicated expression, and despite having defeated the monster, he had not sheathed his shining sword.

Instinctively, she gripped her staff tightly. Several helicopters, noticing the disappearance of the monster's energy response, were approaching. They were a strategic team to assist if Flame was injured or needed support and to handle the monster's corpse.

"Stay back and wait."

After giving a brief command to them, Flame approached Bai Yuseol.

"You're too late, Flame. It's time to go back."

"Where to?"

"To where we originally lived."

"My home is here."

"…Yes. But this is not where you belong."

He pointed to the cold street as he spoke.

"The happier you become, the more unfortunate the world becomes. Will you still stay here?"

This time, she couldn't answer immediately. Flame bit her lip hard. Blood oozed out.

"What do you want me to do?"

"You have to leave this world."

"Where to?"

"You know."

She resented Bai Yuseol, who spoke without any change in expression. Who was this boy to so easily tell her to die?

"It's for your sake."

"I can't believe it."

"I understand. That's why I waited. Until you could accept it. But… I can't wait any longer."

Bai Yuseol was still wearing his school uniform. The name tag on his chest read, "Guwol High School," the name of their alma mater.

"It's reaching its limit. For the sake of this world, you and I must leave."

"I…"

"So, stay still."

The conversation ended there.

[Teleportation]

In the blink of an eye, Bai Yuseol was right in front of her.

'Huh…?'

A white flash split her vision in half.

Crash!

However, the sword strike was blocked by the shield she instinctively deployed, preventing it from cutting her. But the impact shattered the mana shield, causing Flame to retch.

"Damn it… I won't die quietly."

Flame spun her staff and struck it on the ground.

Thud!

A pillar of light surged up, enveloping Bai Yuseol, who was swinging his sword. But instinctively knowing that this wouldn't be enough, she prepared another spell…

Crack!

"Ugh!"

Bai Yuseol, who had somehow gotten behind her, swung his sword, shattering the barrier into pieces. Not stopping there, he aimed his sword at her neck, and Flame rolled forward with all her might.

"Flame! Are you okay?"

Even with her head spinning, she ignored the radio call and rolled on the ground.

Boom!

A burst of light sent Flame's body flying towards the top of a building. Bai Yuseol quickly followed with high-speed movement, but she scattered light spheres randomly in the air.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

She intended to disrupt his movement, but the power was stronger than expected, blowing away one side of the building. Thinking it was rather fortunate, Flame slipped into the gap in the building to catch her breath.

"Crazy bastard… is he really trying to kill me?"

She had no intention of going down quietly. Placing her hand on the ground, massive vines grew, covering the building. If Bai Yuseol entered, she planned to use the plants to press him. No matter how fast he moved, he wouldn't be free in such a narrow space.

Bang!

But Bai Yuseol knew this. Moving to the lower floor of the building, he collapsed the floor, causing Flame to fall without resistance.

'Damn it…!'

With no choice, she surrounded herself with a protective shield of light and used the explosion's recoil to quickly escape the building.

Crash!

The building's debris collapsed, and the spot where Flame had fallen caved in. If she had been a little slower, she would have really died.

'He's coming!'

Unlike her, who was not free in the air, Bai Yuseol moved nimbly. But she had prepared for this.

Creak!

Dozens of vine stems sprouted from the collapsing building, connecting the buildings like bridges, and Flame landed on them.

Whoosh…

The wind blew, and Bai Yuseol's figure blurred again. She could sense it.

'Behind!'

Without looking back, she struck the ground with her staff, summoning a pillar of light behind her… but there was no impact. Looking up, she saw Bai Yuseol, who had anticipated this, moving forward and swinging his sword.

Crash!

"Ugh…"

Half of her shield shattered, twisting her insides severely. Blood oozed from her mouth. But she didn't give up and manipulated the vines with all her might.

Creak!

The vines transformed into a steel-like material, coiling around Bai Yuseol's body like a snake. No matter where he teleported, he couldn't escape. But he deflected or cut through the steel with his sword, approaching her.

'Close combat is disadvantageous.'

Sweating profusely, she manipulated the vines to leap to the opposite building.

Crackle! Crackle!

Magic fragments flew, and neon signs exploded and fell. Bai Yuseol stepped on the neon signs and jumped towards her.

'I have to block him…'

But no matter how many shields she deployed, no matter what attacks she tried, nothing worked. It felt like hitting a massive wall. The opponent simply moved quickly and swung his sword, while none of her diverse magic could counter him.

Was it because it was her first time in a magic battle? The overwhelming difference in experience loomed before her eyes.

"You bastard!!"

She realized she couldn't match him no matter what. But she wouldn't give up, no matter who the opponent was. Flame used the vines to move between buildings, shooting light, while Bai Yuseol deflected everything and pursued her.

The entire New York lit up with light, plants grew, and explosions echoed. All because of the fight between just two people.

"Huff, huff…"

Dropping the vines weakly, Flame landed on the rooftop of a building, kneeling. She seemed to see the city's horizon in the distance. Now she realized… this place was the famous Empire State Building.

'To think I'd visit New York's landmark like this.'

With a wry thought, Flame struggled to stand up.

Tap!

Hearing the sound of Bai Yuseol landing behind her, she turned her head. Their eyes met. Clear black pupils.

"Why…"

She no longer cast any magic. She just spoke to Bai Yuseol, who was slowly approaching her.

"Why are you so determined to kill me…"

She resented him. He said that everything would be resolved if she died. How could such a thing be possible?

She was happy. Every day she lived, every moment was filled with happiness. Whether eating, walking on the street, studying, playing with friends, watching movies, hunting monsters, or sleeping, every moment was filled with happiness.

But the fact that her happiness was pushing the world into misery. That the world was heading towards destruction because of her existence.

"That's too much…"

Tears welled up in Flame's eyes. Even if she didn't want to accept it, she had no choice but to. She knew. She had sensed it long ago. While living as if she were the protagonist of this world, she had always harbored doubts.

'Why am I the only one so happy?'

Bai Yuseol, who had approached her, pointed his sword at her neck. Without resisting, she lowered her head. She closed her eyes and gritted her teeth. She asked.

"If I disappear… will this world really become happy?"

"Then what will happen to me…?"

It was a strange question. She was going to die anyway, so what did it matter what happened to her? But surprisingly, Bai Yuseol gave a straightforward answer.

"You will be happy even after death."

"…Haha, what a joke. How can I be happy when I'm dead?"

This time, he didn't answer immediately. Bai Yuseol hesitated. But in the end, he didn't say anything. There was no need to anymore. He smiled. It looked like a madman smiling while killing someone, but Bai Yuseol seemed relieved, as if he had finally resolved all his burdens.

"No, you will truly be happy. I will make sure of it."

"What? What does that…"

She couldn't finish her sentence. From the sky… a white light was falling.

"Isn't it beautiful?"

"No, wait…"

"It's the characteristic of the monster I hunted this time. The main body is nothing special, but when it dies, it drops a pillar of light on its corpse. It's called Heaven's Gate because it looks like an angel descending…"

Bai Yuseol started mumbling something. Had he ever spoken so much before? But he spoke as if he were talking to a close friend, as if they were sitting in a café, chatting.

She couldn't hear him.

'Haha…'

So, this is how I die. Feeling that the time had come, she accepted this moment humbly.

Swoosh!

In the world that was gradually being painted white, Bai Yuseol grabbed her hand and helped her up. He said something, but it was drowned out by the loud noise, so she couldn't hear it at all. But she could clearly understand his lip movements.

'Let's go back.'

Only then did Flame remember who this boy, who had come to take her, was.

'Ah, that's right.'

Why hadn't she remembered until now? How foolish.

'You came all the way here to take me back.'

At the highest point of the city, covered in complete white light, Flame finally smiled brightly. It was a happier smile than any moment she had spent in this world.
