# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 176

## Chapter 40: The Seventh Main Tower (7)

The darkness that extended from the full-length mirror swallowed Flame whole and dragged her inside. It happened so suddenly and swiftly that no one present could react properly.

"Uh, uh..."

Angel stared blankly at the full-length mirror. Professor Chekiren was also too flustered to even think of using magic, and Anella collapsed to the ground.

"What... is this...?"

She couldn't understand. Flame, who had always been confident and unyielding, had perfectly overcome countless incidents and adversities until now. She thought Flame would succeed this time as well. No matter how powerful and threatening the dark mage appeared, she believed they could win if they fought bravely without retreating, just like before. But to disappear so futilely like this...

"Ah..."

Thud! Angel dropped her staff and sank to the ground. She was too young to experience the loss of someone she had fought alongside, risking her life. Angel couldn't fully grasp the situation.

'What went wrong?'

She tried to recall what had gone wrong, but she couldn't figure out anything. Unfortunately, the girls hadn't done anything wrong. If they had fought according to the plan, they would have undoubtedly won. The only problem was...

...Flame was the 'Child of the Stars.'

"Haha, hahaha!"

Chekiren burst into laughter belatedly. He thought the full-length mirror was under attack and that they were in a life-or-death crisis, but to think that the person inside would directly devour the opponent!

"Truly surprising."

It seemed there was a reason she bore the name of Stella. To think a mere first-year student could momentarily surprise a dark mage and a magic professor like him; she deserved praise.

"But in the end, it turned out like this, didn't it?"

Whoosh!! A dark red flame flared up. The red waves, flowing with Chekiren's anger, began to engulf the entire area menacingly.

"Now that the most troublesome one is gone, let's end this."

The more fiercely the opponent resisted, the harder it was to subdue them without killing them. But now, with Flame, the major force, gone, it would be very easy. Professor Chekiren spread his hands to create the most splendid and beautiful flame. The magic he prepared for the final act was none other than the crimson flame of the Adolevit royal family.

"...Hmm?"

But something felt off. Unlike other flames, the Adolevit flame was characterized by its serene beauty rather than burning passionately or being threatening. However, the flame Chekiren produced now was just an ordinary, featureless red flame.

'Wait, this isn't right...!'

At that moment, whoosh-!!

"Ugh...?!"

A crimson blade flew from behind and pierced his heart.

"Ugh...!"

He tried to grasp the blade that had penetrated his chest, but it had no physical form. The blade without a shape... it was the true flame. Redder than anything else, and thus more passionate and beautiful. The true flame of Adolevit.

Chekiren slowly turned his head. There stood Princess Hong Biyeon, barely supporting herself against the wall, drenched in cold sweat.

'How...?'

He was sure he had completely taken over Hong Biyeon's consciousness. He had even perfectly seized her magic. Her soul was supposed to be forever trapped in the full-length mirror, destined to wander and eventually disappear. He thought the body left behind was just an empty shell. But upon reconsideration, he hadn't 'personally' collected her soul. More precisely... the person inside the full-length mirror had absorbed her soul directly.

'Could it be...?'

Chekiren forcefully pulled out the crimson blade and looked at the full-length mirror.

"Is that what it means to be the Child of the Stars?"

Currently, the power of the person sleeping inside the full-length mirror was still very weak. It was difficult for them to even properly absorb a single flame of the Adolevit family. And now, having absorbed Flame, the Child of the Stars, it was impossible to maintain their abilities properly.

"...I don't know what's going on, but you should be prepared from now on."

Hong Biyeon forced herself to speak each word carefully. She wanted to collapse and faint right there, as she had no energy left in her body, but if she lost consciousness here, everything would truly be over. Thinking that, however...

"Haha... hahaha."

Chekiren, as if he had lost all will to fight, slowly stepped back, holding his face with both hands and shaking his head.

"Damn it... I can't even endure this much? And yet you lied to me...? You deceived me? Damn it, damn it!"

"What...?"

Hong Biyeon, who had been raising flames, was taken aback by Chekiren's nonsensical ranting. His anger dissipated into the air, but one thing was clear. Chekiren had completely given up.

It was strange. A high-ranking dark mage wouldn't die just from having their heart pierced. Although Hong Biyeon had struck a vital point, it should have been easy for him to kill the students. Yet, he did nothing and collapsed.

"...Everything has become meaningless."

The higher the goals and ambitions one had, the harder it was to endure the moment when all those dreams shattered like bubbles. Chekiren clutched his face with both hands, sobbing, then slowly raised his head to look at the girls. First, he looked at Hong Biyeon and Angel, whose powers he had absorbed, and finally at Anella.

"...It's a pity for you all."

"What do you mean, pity?"

Anella, who was already scared, shouted defensively. But Angel, hearing those words, slowly began to accept the harsh reality and asked, word by word,

"...What will happen to Flame?"

"Answer us!"

"Why ask when you already know?"

Chekiren gestured towards the full-length mirror with his chin.

"That place is a fragment of a shattered world, completely detached from reality. A normal human soul can't return once it enters. That's why I absorbed your souls."

The reason the person inside the full-length mirror couldn't act alone and needed Chekiren as a medium was precisely that. But to think it would be this weak. If he had known that it couldn't even withstand a single soul like Flame's and had to spit out all the souls, he wouldn't have started this dangerous endeavor in the first place.

Chekiren closed his eyes. When Flame and the person inside the full-length mirror merged and disappeared, his soul, bound to that place, would also vanish.

"Wait... we can't let it end like this!"

Thud! Hong Biyeon, who had approached Chekiren, bit her pale lips and pointed her staff at his neck.

"Tell us."

"Tell us how to bring her back."

"Hah, it's impossible. That world is like a shattered mirror. If you look to the right, you see the left; if you look to the left, you see the back. What do you plan to do in such a mixed-up world? If you really want to, go ahead and jump in. If you both die together, it will be quite a sight for the final journey."

Hong Biyeon gritted her teeth and looked at Angel and Anella. Then, she asked the most dreadful question she never wanted to ask.

"Did you come here to save me?"

Anella couldn't answer, and Angel hesitated for a moment before nodding.

"...Yes. Flame formed this team to save you."

"I see... then there's no need to hesitate."

Hong Biyeon turned her steps. She headed not for the exit but for the full-length mirror.

"Wait! Stop!"

Realizing what Hong Biyeon was about to do, Angel hurriedly ran and grabbed her arm. But Hong Biyeon shook off Angel's hand and glared fiercely.

"Don't interfere!"

For a moment, Angel flinched. Hong Biyeon's eyes were burning like flames. Angel couldn't understand her emotions at all. What was she so angry about? What was she so emotional about?

"I have to go..."

Hong Biyeon, with her eyes unfocused as if she had lost her mind, headed towards the mirror. It was clear that entering there in her current state, with most of her mana depleted, would be a death sentence.

"...I can't let you do that."

Angel grabbed Hong Biyeon's hand tightly from behind.

"Flame sacrificed herself to save you. How can you make that sacrifice meaningless? I can't let you do that."

"...Let go."

"If you really want to go, burn me first. You always say that, don't you?"

But Hong Biyeon just glared at Angel without any intention of using magic to threaten her. As expected, she never forgets a favor. No, it went beyond that. Princess Hong Biyeon had a strong tendency to be infinitely generous to those who did something for her without expecting anything in return. With something like a giant wedge driven into her head, heart, and chest, how could she just watch Flame's death, who had risked her life to save her, go in vain?

"I have to go..."

Angel was surprised. It was the first time she had seen Princess Hong Biyeon of Adolevit show such a weak side. She looked like she was about to cry, forcing herself to keep her head down, disappointed and angry at her own helplessness. Now, everything just seemed hateful.

As Hong Biyeon finally lost her strength and collapsed, Angel supported her. It seemed like everything was over. Maybe they should be satisfied with just saving Hong Biyeon.

...At that moment.

"Ah, damn it. Am I too late?"

A voice was heard. The three girls simultaneously turned their gaze to the source. There stood Baek Yuseol, wiping the sweat off his cheeks and tidying his disheveled hair.

"Ah..."

For a moment, she thought. The situation was desperate, impossible, and blocked by a huge wall that seemed insurmountable. But with just one boy's arrival, all this meaningless situation suddenly turned hopeful. Why was that?

He glanced around the hall with a dissatisfied expression, then stared intently at the full-length mirror.

"Sigh. My life is really something."

Baek Yuseol walked over and patted Angel and Hong Biyeon on the shoulders, as if to comfort them for their hard work. With just that one act, all their worries and concerns seemed to wash away, bringing them relief.

"I'll be back in a bit."

As if he were taking a light walk with a dog in the neighborhood, his steps were relaxed and light, but his back was reliable and reassuring.

Whoosh! Clang-!

He stepped towards the full-length mirror and completely disappeared. But there was no worry. Instead, they felt relieved.

"Ah..."

"Princess Hong Biyeon? Wake up!"

Finally, she let go of all her worries and fell into a deep sleep. When she woke up again... everything would be resolved.
