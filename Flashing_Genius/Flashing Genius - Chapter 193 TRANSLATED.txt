# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 193: Everything is Frozen (6)

They say that when you're truly exhausted, the sky appears yellow. This is something our ancestors and senior physical education students at school often mentioned. However, I doubt any of them have ever been as exhausted as I am now.

"Haa..."

After the bet was over, I collapsed onto the ground and stared up at the sky. The blue sky seemed to hum and vibrate. The whole world spun around, and my vision flickered as if it might go out at any moment. I genuinely thought I was going to die.

For an ordinary human, running a marathon for two hours without rest would be incredibly tough. And since I am also human, even though my stamina might be slightly better due to my magic leakage delay, it was still just as exhausting.

But this place is a frozen space. My body was already half-dead, and stamina meant nothing here. I just had to endure. I wouldn't die from exhaustion, and even if I reached my physical limits, I wouldn't collapse from fatigue.

However, mental strength was the issue. As long as my willpower allowed, I could run forever. Forever.

Here, I truly benefited from the "Blessing of Yeonhongchun Samwol." This special ability, which grants an indomitable spirit, had never been utilized properly before, and I never imagined I would use it in such a place.

The Blessing of Yeonhongchun Samwol... If I had to compare, it felt like she was pushing my back up a steep hill. The beautiful and enchanting Yeonhongchun Samwol clung to my back, whispering, "Hang in there," or "You can do it." How could I give up?

Three months... Thanks to that, I climbed and climbed for 90 days and finally gained recognition from Cheongdong Sibiwol.

Boom...!

The blue giant approached me with heavy footsteps and spoke.

"State your name."

"...Baek Yuseol."

"Good. Since you won the bet, I will grant your wish."

With those words, I struggled to stand up. Cheongdong Sibiwol formed an ice crystal in the air and handed it to me. It might look like a small icicle, but it was an "Ancient" grade artifact.

**[Aegirix's Chest]**

A key that can lift the curse of eternal ice. Although it was a one-time use item, it was still the first ancient artifact I obtained in this world, so I felt a sense of nostalgia.

"Aside from that... you are the first human in a thousand years to truly impress me."

I made eye contact with Cheongdong Sibiwol. Although I couldn't read the expression of the Twelve Gods, the gleam in his eyes suggested he was in a very good mood.

"Therefore, I will bestow my blessing upon you. Although your abilities are insignificant and you cannot fully accept my blessing... if you grow in the future, you will be able to harness its true power."

Immediately, a blue pillar of light struck me like lightning.

Boom!!

...Something, like a massive tidal wave, poured overwhelming energy into my entire body.

Ugh! The pain was so unbearable that I wanted to close my eyes and die right then and there... but I endured. I had survived three months, so I couldn't collapse from just this.

I endured, withstood, and accepted all the energy without ever kneeling. Finally, I could see the greatest blessing and gift with my own eyes.

"Huff, huff...!"

"Yes! I knew you could endure it."

He nodded.

"How many humans under the sky have received the blessings of two of the Twelve Gods? Indeed, you might be able to lead our brothers to the 'right form.'"

"The right... form...?"

What was he talking about? Before I could ask, Cheongdong Sibiwol smiled and said,

"It's about time you returned. I think I understand why you made that request."

I nodded quietly, but honestly, I wasn't confident. Time in this place was likely frozen, so not much time would have passed outside. However, it was about time for Hong Biyeon to receive the Hwarang Flower, so I had to reach her somehow...

But my body couldn't hold out any longer. My legs had long since given out, and I wondered if it was even possible to navigate that treacherous ice sea.

"I know your physical condition better than you do. There's no need to push yourself."

"...What?"

"I prefer fast and refreshing developments with dramatic effects!"

What... what are you talking about? As I was about to question him, the ground suddenly gave way, and my body fell under the force of gravity.

...Huh?

I was so surprised that I couldn't even resist as I fell. Cheongdong Sibiwol bared his white teeth and gave me a thumbs-up.

"Good luck!"

Luck, my foot, you damn Twelve Gods!

"Aaaah!"

And so, I fell. Towards the end of the story.

* * *

On the coast of Levian, in the frozen whirlpool, five massive airships flew over the sinking pirate ship.

Boom...!

Suddenly, thunderclouds gathered in the sky and roared with lightning, as if to forbid any further approach. Queen Hong Seryu looked at the sky with a calm expression and slowly parted her lips.

"They're coming."

Screeech!!

As soon as she spoke, translucent blue figures poured out of the thunderclouds. Most of them had the form of skeletons, wearing tattered and shattered armor, wielding crude cutlasses from a thousand years ago.

However, their fighting spirit was real. Their bodies were imbued with powerful mana, capable of tearing through most shields like paper and resisting simple magic.

"They are not undead."

These revenants, returned from death, were known to be notoriously difficult to exterminate. But these were not undead; they were abnormal beings whose souls were frozen just before death.

"So don't be afraid and burn them all!"

At Hong Seryu's command, large red magic circles began to form sequentially from the five massive airships. The multi-layered magic circles, drawn by wizards of 5th class or higher, each contained the power of a 7th class spell.

"Fire."

At the queen's command, a tremendous explosion echoed from the magic circles, and the ghosts circling in the air were instantly engulfed in flames and vanished. However, the ghostly assault showed no signs of ending. Before the wizards could prepare another spell, another ghostly army began to attack the airships!

The wizards tried to intercept the ghosts with individual spells, but they were vastly outnumbered.

"Your Majesty! The airships are freezing!"

"...Use the flares."

"We've already used five!"

Hong Seryu looked down at the ground. Even now, strange-shaped monsters were roaring towards the airships from the frozen sea. Thousands of monsters inhabited the sea, making it nearly impossible to penetrate the army.

The reason she chose to traverse the sky through extreme cold rather than the sea route was precisely because of that.

"We have no choice. We can't land on the ground now."

"Yes! We will use the flares."

Adolevit's special technology, "Flares," prevented the mana stone engines from freezing in this extreme cold, but their number was woefully insufficient to last long. So the best method was just one: to get Hong Biyeon to take the Hwarang Flower to the heart of the whirlpool as quickly as possible.

"Third Princess. Are you ready?"

By now, the airships had reached the vicinity of the pirate ship. Adolevit's magic warriors had admirably held off the thousand-year-old ghost army, but they couldn't hold out much longer.

Hong Biyeon looked at the frozen whirlpool with a determined expression and nodded.

"Let's start right away."

"...Yes. That's the right choice."

She held the box containing the Hwarang Flower tightly to her chest. Wearing a white robe, Hong Biyeon stood tall at the bow of the ship, while three priestesses knelt behind her in prayer.

...Hummm!

The barriers protecting the box containing the Hwarang Flower began to break one by one, and a scorching heat spread out. Hong Biyeon carefully brought her hands to it.

Ugh!

At that moment, the intense heat that enveloped her entire body almost made her lose consciousness, but she endured. She hurriedly rubbed her arms, feeling as if her skin was burning, but it was an illusion.

...Ah...

The flames hadn't even ignited yet, but just the energy wrapping around her body caused this much pain.

"Agh...!"

The pain, like a burn, grew more intense, spreading from her limbs to her head, chest, and thighs, until it felt like her entire body was on fire. It didn't stop there; the excruciating sensation of her internal organs being roasted made her legs almost give out.

But she endured.

...I'm used to it.

In her childhood, she drank fire, showered in fire, ate fire, and wore fire. The sensations from those days came back to her. She was so used to it that it was almost comfortable now. Even as her entire body burned, tore, and melted, Hong Biyeon did not scream.

She could endure it. This much, she could handle.

"Wow, you're interesting."

...Then.

A voice came from somewhere. Hong Biyeon slowly opened her eyes and looked at the Hwarang Flower in her arms. The voice was deep and low, yet somehow lively and energetic.

"Huh? Isn't it painful? Why are you enduring it? Just accept it! If you become the flame itself, this pain will be nothing!"

"...Shut up."

Hong Biyeon tried to ignore the voice. But as the sensation of burning turned into comfort and then gradually into pleasure, she became greatly alarmed.

"What is this...?"

"Isn't it amazing? This is the true flame! I can tell. You're special! Even more than that old woman pretending to be Adolevit's heir without properly inheriting the bloodline!"

Ugh!

She stepped back, but the strange sensation didn't disappear.

"Yes, this is what I wanted! Fresh and pure Adolevit blood... Ha! I like it. Join me. Don't you want to take revenge on that woman behind you? You know, don't you? That woman tried to drive you to death. She knew exactly what it meant to accept me!"

Now she understood. The owner of this voice was none other than the legendary "Fire Incarnate" said to be dormant within the Hwarang Flower.

...Shut up. I won't be swayed by your words.

"Haha, that's not going to be easy."

Ugh!

Suddenly, flames surged up, and her entire body was struck by pain and pleasure.

"Get angry! Accept my power! You can do it. Take revenge on everyone and achieve all your dreams. You know, don't you? The world is hostile to you. So you have no choice but to be hostile in return, right?"

From deep within her chest... the emotion of anger flared up like fire. Burn everything. Everything that made me suffer. Everything that made me struggle. Burn it all, and I will be happy.

"Agh...!"

She tried to shake it off by shaking her head, but she couldn't endure it. The rising anger sparked another flame, spreading everywhere, and soon it became an ignition point and exploded.

Whoosh!

Boom!!

...Ugh!

Hong Seryu, who had been watching her from behind, hastily surrounded herself with a shield to block the flames. The explosive release of mana was so overwhelming that even an 8th class wizard like her was momentarily taken aback.

"This, this is the Fire Incarnate...!!"

Kneeling on the ground and supporting herself with her staff, she looked up and felt the power of the flames. All the skeleton soldiers melted in an instant, and the pillar of fire that pierced the sky made it seem as if the sun had descended.

"A, ah...!"

The wizards began to kneel one by one. The sky, filled with thunderclouds, was engulfed in flames, and a rain of fire began to fall on the frozen sea.

"The Fire Calamity has begun."

It was a disaster that no human power could resist or overcome.

"Just touching it caused such a disaster...!"

She knew the Hwarang Flower was dangerous, but she didn't expect it to go berserk so suddenly.

"Your Majesty!"

"If the Fire Calamity begins, there's no turning back!"

But... what could Hong Seryu do? There was no way. Once the Hwarang Flower started to go berserk, it was impossible to control it.

"Wait."

Could such a flame... occur near the heart of the whirlpool and still be okay? With that fundamental question in mind, she hurriedly tried to check the pirate ship. At that moment, something, a large blue hand, grasped the pirate ship. The massive hand, as if holding a miniature toy, exuded a ghostly aura that even made Hong Seryu's legs give out.

Soon, "it" revealed its face. A blue skull. Red eyes in empty eye sockets. And... a massive body that seemed to reach the sky, wearing the uniform of an ancient pirate king.

"A, ah..."

Hong Seryu collapsed on the spot, dropping her staff. The pirate king, Black Belize. His vengeful spirit had awakened after a thousand years.
