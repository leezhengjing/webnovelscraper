I Became a Genius Teleporter at the Magic Academy

Chapter 213: Old Story (9)

Chirp-chirp. The sound of mountain birds chirping. Plop! The moist sensation of water droplets falling. "〇 _O_." And then, a throbbing headache. Feeling a dreadful nausea that made me want to turn my insides out, I forced myself to sit up. Although I desperately wanted to lie back down, the memories from just before kept flashing through my mind, making it impossible to stay still.

"Remember! The fate of the past must never be changed!" The voice of Yin Shiyue still seemed to echo in my ears. How hard must she have sent that telepathic message for its resonance to linger even now? My ears were ringing.

"Ugh..." My head hurt so much that a groan escaped my lips, but I hurriedly assessed my surroundings. Trees, grass, trees, grass, rocks, trees. And a squirrel.

"Damn it... It's a forest. And right in the middle of it. No matter how versatile the Zhibagu glasses are, without a satellite, they can't pinpoint my exact location like coordinates. I'm practically lost. Moreover, as expected, it seems I've traveled back in time. I should be grateful I didn't get sucked into a space-time rift. 'Ten years ago...'

Was there such a scenario in the original game? Hmm, I vaguely remember there was. Occasionally, there were time travel contents, but they were rare and not well-documented. I have no idea how to navigate this era from ten years ago. Fortunately, thanks to Yin Shiyue engraving the method to return in my mind, I wasn't worried about that part. The problem was the time I had to wait until then. I couldn't think of any immediate danger that would kill me in this time, but it wouldn't hurt to be cautious.

Thinking that, I stood up, feeling unexpectedly light. "Huh?"

『For you who are drifting through the past, Yin Shiyue has bestowed a mysterious blessing.』
『Strength increases by 4 stars.』
『Agility increases by 4 stars.』
『Senses increase by 4 stars.』
『Mental power increases by 4 stars.』
『Endurance increases by 1 star.』
『Skill 'Mana Leakage' is enhanced by three stages.』
『Skill 'Blink' is enhanced by one stage.』

"Oh... What is this?" An enormous increase in stats. It was to the point where I could be considered a completely different person. Of course, such a cheat-like blessing wouldn't last forever, but it was fine. With all my stats increased by 4 stars, I could roughly hold my own against a 7th-class mage even if my skills were a bit lacking. Moreover, thanks to the temporary stat boosts in 'Mana Leakage' and 'Blink,' I wasn't lacking in substance either.

"Oh..." Clenching and unclenching my fists, I felt an overwhelming power I had never experienced before. My senses had also become extremely sharp, allowing me to react sensitively to the blowing wind. I felt like I could leap up and become a long jump champion, if not soar into the sky.

"By the way, where am I?" Even though I had fallen in the middle of the forest, I wasn't too worried thanks to my enhanced stats. Still, I needed to find a safe place. I needed somewhere to stay until I could return to the present.

"Can I use the shortest safe navigation function to the exit?" 
『Impossible.』
"Can you track mana alpha waves to identify danger zones?"
『Impossible.』
"How about situation analysis?"
『Impossible.』
"Is there any registered information about this place?"
"Sigh."

As expected, most of the functions of the Zhibagu glasses were unusable. It seemed they couldn't handle vague questions like 'Where am I?' The only fortunate thing was that I could determine directions by following the constellations and the angle of the shadows. This level of skill was possible even without the help of the Zhibagu glasses. I felt proud of myself for having such survival skills.

...Damn it. Anyway, before I started moving, I made minimal preparations. It wasn't much. I used the appearance modification function built into Stella's coat to slightly alter my appearance. I didn't want to run into a student from this era's Stella, and it wouldn't be good to stand out unnecessarily. Stella students were special wherever they went. Then, I took out a mask to cover my face and disguise myself. I saw it in the movie "Back to the Future." It showed how chaotic things could get if you met people you knew in the past. But that was just a movie, and the reason was slightly different in reality. For example...

Crack! "Kyaaa!"

"Huh?" While rummaging through my spatial expansion backpack with my face covered by the mask, a girl with sky-blue hair suddenly appeared from the bushes. I didn't need to think hard to recognize her. 'E, Angel?' That was... Angel from ten years ago. Much younger, but still cute and adorable enough to want to take her as a cousin. She screamed and ran towards me, not because she noticed me, but because she was being chased by something. Soon enough...

- Growl...

A gigantic wolf, almost the size of a small cabin, appeared behind Angel. "What the...?" Is that even allowed? The Zhibagu glasses quickly displayed the wolf's grade, information, and weaknesses, but the situation was too urgent to read them. So...

Wham! Thud! ...I grabbed the wolf by the scruff and slammed it into the ground. - Yip! Yip! "Huh?"

The wolf, despite its massive size, couldn't escape from my small hand and whimpered. I could feel Angel blinking her large eyes behind me. Honestly, I was surprised too, so it must have been even more shocking from her perspective. 'Wow, is this 7-star level?' In the game, even when my stats increased, it only meant higher attack power and damage, so I didn't feel much difference. But in reality, I could perform such feats. The desire to increase my stats grew stronger.

While pinning the wolf to the ground, I turned to Angel. She flinched and covered her face with both hands, clearly showing her wariness. "Who... who are you?"

"You? This little brat, how rude." At that, she widened her eyes and quickly corrected herself. "W-who are you!"

"What the...?" It seemed she wasn't used to speaking formally. Well, they did say Angel was a spoiled brat in her childhood. She probably used informal speech even with her father. As the precious eldest daughter of the Morpheus family, she wouldn't have had many occasions to speak formally.

"Never mind, you're Angel Morpheus, right? I'm Baek... Seolgi." "Baek Seolgi? That's a rice cake name..."

"A person's name can be a rice cake name too. Stop arguing." "S-sorry!" "...Formal speech."

"Sorry... I decided to compromise, thinking it couldn't be helped that she wasn't yet proficient in formal speech. "So, what were you doing here? Is this wolf your pet?"

"N-no!" "Really?" Well, I wouldn't want to keep such a ferocious pet either. Knowing that, I didn't hesitate to take out my Terriphone and summon a sword of light, stabbing it into the wolf's neck. Thud! Instant death. In the past, it would have taken immense concentration to pierce through its tough and durable skin, but now, a light strike was enough. Angel's eyes widened, but I acted nonchalant as I stood up. Although I wanted to extract the mana core from the wolf's corpse immediately, I refrained to maintain my 'cool guy' image.

"By the way, do you know the way back home?" "Y-yes... I know..."

"Really? Do you have a map?" "No, but..." She pointed somewhere with her finger. "This is our front yard..."

What? The front yard is this big? And why is there such a monster in the front yard? Countless questions swirled in my head, but since this was a romance fantasy world, I tried to accept it. But seriously, what is her dad doing, leaving his daughter alone like this?

"Uh, okay. Let's go." "To... to our house?" "I have nowhere else to go, so hurry up. I'm hungry." "O-okay..."

I had intended to avoid meeting anyone from the present as much as possible, but I ended up encountering Angel right from the start. If this was fate, then so be it. Somehow, it didn't feel like a good start.

Rumble!! Swoosh... Listening to the sound of pouring rain, Haeseongwol quietly gazed out the carriage window. A high-level mage rarely sat idly without any thoughts. Even now, countless problems that would require the efforts of dozens of ordinary mages to solve swirled in Haeseongwol's mind. The issue that occupied the largest portion of that mental whirlpool was, undoubtedly, Baek Yuseol.

"...The rainy season in Hawol Plain is troublesome because of the incessant downpour, but this year is particularly severe, isn't it?" Haeseongwol spoke without even turning his head towards Jellyel, who was sitting next to him, but there was no response. She wouldn't be dozing off in such a situation, so the reason was clear... she was ignoring him. Ignoring a 9th-class mage? If someone thought that, they wouldn't be a 9th-class mage. Having shed all lingering and impure emotions, they were akin to immortals or sages.

"Jellyel. Do you resent me?" At those words, she finally turned her head to look at Haeseongwol. Still, she didn't answer. Jellyel vividly recalled the recent memory. Baek Yuseol, standing on the chessboard of Karmenset, disappearing along with the collapsing space-time. It kept haunting her dreams. Why did he make such a choice? The ancient ruins of Karmenset could be visited again later. But... his life was irreplaceable.

"Miss, Master. We have arrived." The knight spoke in a quiet voice. The destination was 'Starcloud Trading Company.' This city, formed by numerous trading companies including Starcloud, had now been completely taken over by Starcloud Trading Company. At the center of this city stood a large mansion, which was the headquarters and heart of Starcloud Trading Company. It was also the hometown that had taken care of Jellyel's childhood.

Wow!! Let's go, let's go! Upon arriving in the city, numerous people of different races were running around the streets. Something must have happened, but it wasn't serious or dangerous. Everyone's faces were filled with smiles. Jellyel no longer looked out the window. 'No way.' Thump, thump. Her heart pounded violently. 'Not yet, I can't let my guard down...'

She didn't know why they were cheering so joyfully. If she got her hopes up, the disappointment would be greater. 'Calm down.' But as they got closer to the mansion, the cheers grew louder, and the crowd was so massive that it seemed like the entire city had come out, making it difficult for the carriage to move forward. Wow!!!

"...They must be people who owe a debt of gratitude to your father." Chairman Melian was famous for bestowing countless favors while becoming the world's richest man. While Jellyel carried out dirty and despicable tasks without hesitation, Melian performed shining good deeds behind the scenes. Most of the people in this city owed their lives to Melian's benevolence. What could make them so happy? It was obvious. 'It's the lady's carriage!!' Someone recognized Jellyel's carriage and shouted, and the crowd parted like the miracle of the Red Sea, making way for them. It was truly a scene like a movie.

Clunk! The carriage door opened, and Jellyel gracefully extended her slender leg to step out. But it was merely a facade to hide her inability to control her wildly beating heart. All the noise around her quieted down. Jellyel lifted her head and looked straight at the person standing in front of her. It was... unmistakably, her father. Chairman Melian, smiling as he looked at her. But why did her father's image keep blurring?

"Miss. Here's a handkerchief." "Ah..." Only then did she realize her unsightly appearance. "Go on." At Haeseongwol's words, Jellyel finally took a step towards him. Then, suddenly. 'Huh...?' Even though she was facing her father, the mana in her heart hadn't evaporated. 'No, wait, wait a minute...'

She had made a 'Mana Oath' with Baek Yuseol. 『First, do not meet your father within three years.』 If she broke that taboo, all the mana in her heart would evaporate and scatter into the air. However, her mana was still intact, even though her father was right in front of her. "My daughter, I'm sorry for worrying you." Melian's warm embrace confirmed that he was indeed real. "Ah, ah..."

But because of that, she felt the reality even more acutely. The Mana Oath, which seemed perfect, had another rule. 'If the contracted party is annihilated, the oath becomes void.' Not death, but annihilation. This rule, which was practically non-existent as it only activated when the contracted party's existence itself disappeared, had been triggered. Why?

Thud! Unable to even maintain the strength to hug her father, Jellyel collapsed to the ground. Hot tears streamed down her face, and she could no longer hide her emotions. "Ah, ah... ah..." The emotion she felt at that moment was not happiness or anything else... It was despair.
