### Chapter 249: The Noble Soul (2)

The birthplace of magic, the city of Camelon. Though now it was merely a shadow of its former self, there was one special institution that still existed here: the 'Council of Elders'. At the pinnacle of the magical world, they possessed transcendent authority, free from all laws and regulations. All members of the council had reached at least the 8th class, and they rarely gathered unless it was for significant matters. However, today was special, as seven out of the twelve elders had gathered. The reason was none other than the fact that Sael Ri, a 9th class mage and elder of the council, had convened the meeting for the first time in three years.

During regular meetings, attendance was usually very low, and those who wanted to gather did so mostly for casual chatter. But today, the council was unusually quiet.

"…Some are missing," a deep voice from an old man broke the silence, causing the council members to gulp nervously.

Typically, as mages grow stronger, they appear younger. A 6th class mage no longer ages in appearance, a 7th class mage gains a slight youthful look, and an 8th class mage can maintain the appearance of someone in their twenties or thirties. Ultimately, a 9th class mage undergoes a phenomenon called 'Rejuvenation' or 'Body Change', where their body transforms into the most ideal structure for using magic, giving them a youthful appearance.

However, Sael Ri was different. Despite being a 9th class sage, he had completely let go of any attachment to his appearance and stubbornly maintained the look of an old man. With a long white beard reaching his chest and a traditional wizard's hat, he looked like a classic mage from a novel, reflecting his old-fashioned and stubborn nature.

"Yes. Hedaron had to return urgently due to issues in his territory, and Palat has been in seclusion for about half a year seeking enlightenment."

"If it's personal matters, it can't be helped. What about the others?"

"…They did not provide a reason for their absence."

"I see."

As the old man nodded, some council members began to sweat. Missing a meeting convened by Sael Ri without a valid reason would result in severe penalties.

'…Those guys are in big trouble now.'

Since there was no way to bring the absent members immediately, the meeting began without them.

"The Green Tower has started to move."

As Sael Ri spoke, some council members sighed and shook their heads.

"Why now, after being quiet for over ten years…"

The Green Tower and the Council of Elders were similar in nature. Both were small groups of 8th class mages, with a 9th class mage at the top. However, the Green Tower was closer to the 'outlaws' of the magical world, while the Council of Elders was more like the 'rulers'. Naturally, the two were at odds with each other. The Green Tower was one of the few entities that could threaten the Council of Elders, so it was natural for the council members to feel uneasy.

"The witch has appeared and was killed by a mere mage. It's not surprising, considering the Green Tower master's sensitivity to witches."

"Indeed."

"Foolish women. If they were going to hide, they should have done it properly instead of showing themselves and getting killed…"

"Hey, what happened to the witch you captured?"

"She died. She couldn't withstand the experiments."

"Tsk. That's what happens when you handle good materials carelessly. If it were me, I would have made use of her for ten years…"

"Enough. Stop the idle chatter."

As Sael Ri struck the floor with his staff, the room fell silent, as if a silence spell had been cast.

"This isn't the first time the Green Tower has acted independently. However, there's one problem… the Black Moon Tower has also started to move."

"What? The Black Moon Tower?"

"Yes."

In this world, there were only two entities known as 'Great Towers': the Full Moon Tower, the most famous magical tower, and the Black Moon Tower, hidden in the shadows. The Black Moon Tower was also a threat to the Council of Elders. Despite decades of searching with all their might, they had not left any trace, making it difficult to track them down.

The Black Moon Tower was beneficial in that it eradicated dark mages, but in the process, they committed numerous crimes, leading the magical world to label them as criminals and pursue them. However, this was merely a facade, as it was impossible to properly track the Black Moon Tower.

"Both the Green Tower and the Black Moon Tower… Is this matter that significant?"

After all, it was just one witch who appeared and was killed. To the general public, a witch might be special, but to the Black Moon Tower and the Green Tower, witches were not unfamiliar.

"She wasn't an ordinary witch. That witch was… a disciple of the 'Last Witch'."

"W-What…!"

"Could it be… that the successor of the Last Witch still exists?"

"Yes."

The council gulped. The magic of the Last Witch was the ultimate magic that could turn illusions into reality, the most powerful magic on earth. It was the most coveted magic by all mages, alchemists, and magitechnicians… the most 'perfect magic' in the world.

"What happened to that magic?"

The council urgently asked, but Sael Ri shook his head.

"It was lost. She was killed by a student of Stella Academy in a subspace, leaving no corpse behind."

"Oh no… To think we couldn't extract that precious magic…"

However, at that moment, all the council members had the same question.

The magic of the Last Witch was so fantastic, it was almost divine. It was one of the most beautiful legacies left by the progenitor mage. So why…

'How could someone with such magic be killed by a mere student of Stella?'

That question lingered in their minds.

"Baek Yuseol."

Sael Ri calmly uttered the name.

"Both the Green Tower and the Black Moon Tower are focusing on that child."

By mentioning that name here, Sael Ri also indicated his deep interest in the boy named Baek Yuseol.

"We are well aware of Baek Yuseol."

"Should we bring him to the council?"

"No. There's no need. If he wants to come, he will. If not, no matter what you do, you won't be able to bring him."

"What? It's not that difficult to move a mere student."

"You don't understand."

Sael Ri clicked his tongue.

"The boy is… a special child who has escaped fate. It would be best for you to step back and not interfere. Why can't you understand that?"

At his words, the council members fell silent. Sael Ri occasionally made such cryptic remarks, but they always carried deep meaning, so they had to accept them even if they didn't understand.

"However, the fact that the Green Tower is eyeing that child… is a bit concerning."

"…What should we do?"

"Convene the Magical Council to restrain the Green Tower. Prevent them from moving recklessly and suppress their activities."

The order was simple but not easy. The mages of the Green Tower were generally docile, but the Green Tower master and his mentor, 'that woman', were both 9th class mages.

"There's no need to worry. The youngling from Stella also seems to be thinking of restraining the Green Tower."

"…Is that so."

Eltman Eltrwin, the headmaster of Stella Academy, was the youngest among the 9th class mages but also the most powerful. Knowing that he would help, the council members felt somewhat relieved.

With that, the meeting concluded. As Sael Ri was about to leave, one of the council members hurriedly asked.

"Elder, what about the Black Moon Tower?"

"…The Black Moon Tower."

He looked up at the night sky. All three moons were hidden behind clouds, making the sky dark.

"The moon is full."

"Excuse me?"

The council member asked, puzzled by his cryptic words, but Sael Ri turned and left without answering.

'…The Twelve Moons are moving.'

While the movements of the Green Tower and the Black Moon Tower were understandable, why had the Twelve Moons suddenly started to act at this time?

'I must meet with the Returning Moon.'

To confirm whether the world was indeed flowing according to fate, he had to meet with the Silver Moon and the Returning Moon directly.

Sael Ri disappeared like a mirage, leaving the council member who had been waiting for an answer with a dumbfounded expression and a hollow laugh.

"Something is about to happen again without our knowledge…"

8th class mages? The Council of Elders outside of power? What use are they? This world is driven by a very few great beings. They can read fate and have even learned to walk outside of it. But what about themselves? Unaware of their bondage to fate, they live intoxicated by power and strength, thinking they stand at the highest point.

Even those above them live chasing some purpose.

"But… there's nothing we can do."

The 9th class was a realm that could not be reached by effort or talent alone. It was, literally, a divine revelation. Some reached the 9th class because the night sky was beautiful. Some reached it after gaining enlightenment in a dream. Some reached it after hearing the voice of a god during meditation.

A genius born once in a thousand years? It means nothing. How many geniuses have despaired at the wall of the 9th class?

The 9th class is… truly the realm of gods, transcending humans. The world they live in is completely different from the one we live in.

Understanding this, the council members turned away powerlessly. They had formed the Council of Elders decades ago, hoping to glimpse even the edge of the 9th class. Yet, they still did not understand even a fraction of the divine realm.

* * *

Standing at the edge of a cliff, feeling the wind blow, one might feel as if they are swaying, even though they are not moving.

'The world revolves around the sun.'

These were the words of a mage and philosopher from a very long time ago. That single statement, which shook the very foundations of the world, had turned the magical world upside down, leading to a complete reorganization of all magic. Hundreds of years had passed since then.

"Can you feel it? The flow of the world."

Ludrick Hallow, the master of the Black Moon Tower and a great 9th class mage, stood at the edge of the cliff, enjoying the sensation of the world revolving around the sun. Of course, this was a sensation that ordinary people could not feel at all.

"I'm not interested in such things."

"How boring."

The one who answered Ludrick's words was a man with gray hair and gray eyes, dressed in peculiar attire. His very presence was extraordinary. His name was… the Returning Moon, the strongest of the Twelve Moons.

"So, why have you come to see me?"

"I came to talk to that old man lying there."

The Returning Moon pointed somewhere with his gaze, and Ludrick smiled. The old man lying drunk and asleep on a bed in the air outside the cliff was also one of the Twelve Moons, the Silver Moon.

"It's rare for two of the Twelve Moons to meet… Is that okay?"

The Twelve Moons were 'fated' not to meet each other. Ludrick knew this. When all of them gathered, something very, very terrible would happen… because the progenitor mage had left such a prophecy.

"It doesn't matter."

"Well, I suppose so. All the other Twelve Moons, except for you, are bound by their own shackles and can't move."

"Enough with the small talk. Wake him up."

As the Returning Moon said this, Ludrick smiled.

"That's a bit difficult. The old man has a lot of worries and stress. He's finally getting some sleep, so should we wake him?"

"It's none of your business."

As the Returning Moon took a step forward, Ludrick blocked his path.

"You can't go any further, Returning Moon."

"…Are you going to stop me?"

"Yes."

Ludrick looked at the Silver Moon with a complicated expression. It had been several months since his 'foresight' ability had stopped working properly, and he had come to the Silver Moon to find the cause. But it turned out that the Silver Moon himself was also unable to foresee the future properly.

The fact that the Returning Moon had come to him was not a good sign. The Returning Moon was extremely sensitive to predetermined fate and hated things that did not follow the set course. Even if the world were to collapse, the Returning Moon's choice would not change.

'Fate flows according to the will of the stars.'

He believed in that more than anyone else.

"Let's not do this at a good time, shall we?"

Ludrick had the opposite belief. A new star, capable of changing fate, was shining brightly, and he couldn't let it be hindered.

'I can't let that happen.'

As someone who had once been blessed by the Silver Moon, he felt obligated to carry out his will. With that thought, Ludrick conjured 'void' on his finger. It was a power of the same nature as the Returning Moon's, dimensional power.

Seeing this, the Returning Moon frowned.

"Are you going to challenge me with void?"

"Just because you are made of void doesn't mean you handle it best, does it?"

"Interesting theory. I've never liked the arrogance of you mages."

After saying this, the Returning Moon took a step towards him. The shortest step in the world, yet perhaps the longest.

Boom!!

As dimensions collided, space collapsed, and gravity reversed, causing everything to float into the gaps of the dimension.

"Ugh…"

The Silver Moon, who had been sleeping soundly, had a dream. A happy dream where he played poker with a boy and won overwhelmingly.
