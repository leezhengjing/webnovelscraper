# I Became a Genius in the Magic School's Front Blink

## Chapter 251: The Noble Soul (4)

In the far east of Aither, there is a place called the Eastern Cliffs. The shadow cast by the cliffs, which are struck by the sun every day, is said to resemble a dragon ascending to the heavens, earning it the name 'Heavenly Dragon Cliff.' Although it seemed to have lost its charm as a tourist destination due to the erosion of dark magic over the past 100 years, it still breathed life as a place sought by many adventurers. However, it seems that its lifespan has ended today.

Clouds rise from the ground. Not metaphorical clouds, but actual clouds that float in the sky. However, due to the distortion of space, they are momentarily confused about their position and settle on the ground. The clouds, no different from mist, are blown away by the wind, revealing a terrain that is more like a basin than a cliff. The once majestic and beautiful cliff has collapsed into a plain, and the mountain range that formed the backbone of the Eastern Cliffs has been uprooted and forcibly relocated. Adventurers who visit this place may need to redraw their maps.

"…Ah. This is troublesome."

Rudrick Hallow, the Tower Master of the Tower of the Withering Moon, tried to wipe the blood flowing from his mouth with his sleeve, but he realized that his right arm had long been crushed and disappeared beyond the dimensional rift.

"Haha, the Twelve Moons are still a bit too much for me…"

The duel with Hui Gongshi Yue had been a valuable experience for him. The magic battles of spatial mages are fundamentally different from ordinary magic battles. For those who fight while ignoring spatial constraints, even the phrase 'seeing one move ahead' loses its meaning.

Step-!

Hui Gongshi Yue, who appeared through the clouds, looked coldly at the fallen Rudrick.

"Why do something so pointless? Is there a reason for this, mage?"

"Who knows."

Even though he knew he would lose, it wasn't entirely meaningless. He could change a 'very minor event' that would happen in the future. If Rudrick's prediction was correct, Hui Gongshi Yue would have sensed the twist of fate from Yin Shi Yue here. Of course, anyone at the 9th class level could feel that fate was currently being twisted, so Hui Gongshi Yue must have felt it too. However, he would not have discovered the most fatal 'cause of the change in fate.'

The moment the Twelve Moons interfere recklessly in worldly affairs, all events and stories become distorted. Hui Gongshi Yue would never act in ignorance. He would have tried to find and eliminate the 'one cause' of the twist in fate through Yin Shi Yue. That must not be allowed. Hui Gongshi Yue can see the entire world, but… he cannot see very small and trivial things. His fatal flaw must be exploited to the fullest. Until the day… that boy can stand against Hui Gongshi Yue.

"There are less than ten years left until the end of the world's flow. You struggle in vain, mage."

After saying that, Hui Gongshi Yue looked into the void. He tried to find the traces of the vanished Yin Shi Yue, but the old man had fled so quickly that he couldn't be found.

"…Next time, it won't end like this."

After saying that, Hui Gongshi Yue disappeared through the gray space.

"Haa…"

Rudrick, exhaling a hot breath, slowly stood up and touched the spot where his right arm had disappeared with his left hand. Then, a golden light flickered, and the severed arm grew back in an instant. Although he had to pour an enormous amount of mana into the process of restoring the lost body part, it was better than being inconvenienced.

"By the way, you are quite impressive."

Rudrick spoke to the air as if talking to himself. Surprisingly, a silver line appeared in the air, and the space split open, revealing Yin Shi Yue, who had hidden himself long ago.

"To be able to deceive a spatial mage of the Twelve Moons… you are quite skilled in spatial manipulation."

"Time and space are inseparable. I've lived on the run for hundreds of years, so I had to become skilled."

Yin Shi Yue muttered bitterly.

"Have I been living too irresponsibly, putting everything down?"

"…That's not true."

Although he denied it, Rudrick couldn't help but feel pity. Perhaps… Yin Shi Yue had seen some terrible vision that even the impending destruction of the world in ten years couldn't compare to. That's why he gave up his foresight. He chose a life of running away, leaving even his memories with his 'fragment,' and as a result, this situation occurred.

'What kind of vision did he see that even Yin Shi Yue couldn't overcome his fear and turned his back to flee?'

A question Rudrick had always had.

"Are you worried?"

When Yin Shi Yue suddenly asked, Rudrick nodded.

"…Yes."

The old man smiled bitterly and walked away somewhere.

"I am indeed a pathetic sight."

But why did his back not seem heavy? As if he had shaken off all the burdens he had been carrying. It was certain. He had made a decision. Perhaps… he had made the decision even before meeting Rudrick. What had changed him? The moment the question arose, it was resolved. There was only one person in this world who could shake fate. 

'It's only been half a year since he appeared in the world…'

What a fast boy. Thinking that, Rudrick closed his eyes. Due to the exhaustion from the previous battle… he needed to rest a bit.

* * *

Compared to modern times, communication methods in Aither are extremely inconvenient. Not only are there no personal mobile phones, but if the other person is not near a phone, contacting them is very difficult.

-I'm fine, so you don't need to worry.

Especially if the other person is the Elf King. It was absurd for an ordinary student to contact him personally without any prior arrangement, but thanks to Altherisha, I managed to get my personal phone number to him, making contact possible.

"Are you really sure nothing's wrong?"

-Of course. Are you worried about me?

When Hwaseorin joked, I answered nonchalantly.

"Well, yes."

-…Oh, really?

She was silent for a moment, then let out a light laugh.

-Haha, I don't know why, but it feels good.

Even after hearing her answer, I couldn't be relieved. It wasn't just that I was worried about her; I was worried about myself. Recently, I've had a problem with my mind. To be precise, it was more accurate to say that there was a problem with the skill 'Blessing of the Spring of the Red Lotus.'

I know my own mental strength well. It's ridiculous to average out mental strength, but I was born with a fairly strong mind, overcoming a troubled childhood positively. On top of that, I received the blessing of the Spring of the Red Lotus, so I thought I had an ironclad mentality that wouldn't falter in any situation. Yet, a negative emotion kept seeping into my mind.

'Despair.'

So, it was right to think that there was a problem with the Spring of the Red Lotus… but…

-Anyway, I'm doing well without any worries. Recently, I've been taking off my mask more often, so I even feel refreshed.

Hwaseorin, who also received the blessing of the Spring of the Red Lotus, had no problems. This meant that the problem wasn't with the Spring of the Red Lotus but with my mind itself. So, there were two possible causes. Either I had become so negative that even the Spring of the Red Lotus couldn't handle it, or someone connected to my mind had a problem.

It wasn't the former. I lived enjoying the world without any particular thoughts, and I had the mindset of 'what's the worst that could happen' even if something happened. So, it was certain that the cause was 'Iphanel,' who was connected to my mind.

"Hmm, do you have time?"

-…Time?

Hwaseorin paused as if contemplating, and I realized I had made a mistake. Asking the Elf King, who was always busy, if she had time was absurd. Even a chimpanzee wouldn't ask such a question.

"Oh, sorry - I think I can make time."

"…Really?"

-Yes. I can't spare much time because I'm swamped with work, but…

She sighed deeply, full of worry. It seemed that the vacancy left by the retirement of her assistant, Orenha, was significant.

"Well… even a short time is fine. I plan to visit Iphanel."

-Oh, really?

Iphanel was said to be one of Hwaseorin's very close friends. Perhaps her only friend. Anyway, she cherished Iphanel greatly and, as a High Elf, was very sensitive to the state of spirits. Besides that, I also wanted to arrange a time to meet Iphanel together.

-That sounds great. When should we meet?

"Is this weekend okay?"

After speaking, I wondered if the King was as busy on weekends as on weekdays, but Hwaseorin answered without hesitation.

-Yes! See you on the weekend.

After ending the call, I checked the time. It was almost time to go out for a meal with Mayuseong and Eizel as part of our club activities. Since it was summer, I didn't need a coat, so I just wore my school shirt and vest. As I stepped out, I saw a group of second-year seniors heading somewhere. Judging by their attire, I could guess.

'League of Spirit.'

If Soul Chess is the top intellectual sport in the magic world, then League of Spirit is the top physical sport. Naturally, there was a League of Spirit club in Stella, and its scale was incomparable to my gourmet club. It received astronomical sponsorships, almost like a professional sports team, and considering the massive annual tournaments held for youth teams from magic schools, it was understandable. Given that this school was 'Stella,' the top name, astronomical sponsorships were also expected. This was a matter of pride between schools.

"Hmm, this is troublesome…"

"What should we do?"

"Let's just bring in senior Malek from the third year."

"That senior has excellent individual skills but poor teamwork… and he doesn't follow orders well."

"Moreover, the remaining TO must be filled with first-year students. Bringing in a third-year would incur a penalty."

"What can we do?"

As I tried to pass by them, it seemed they had encountered a troublesome problem. I could sense it.

'A sub-episode flag.'

This was a common event in the game Aither World Online when played as the character 'Flame.' A plain commoner girl, Flame, who had no interest in clubs, ended up playing as a substitute in the League of Spirit and discovered her dazzling talent—a very common and clichéd setting. This was a prologue event that players experienced before engaging in online League of Spirit matches, and over 90% of players went through this episode. And now, that event was…

"Oh, you're first-year Baek Yuseol, right?"

"That's right. I heard he's smart."

"He doesn't seem to have played League of Spirit, but… wouldn't he be okay?"

Then the seniors approached me and asked.

"Have you ever played League of-"

"I'm not interested."

I quickly refused and ran away.

"Wait! At least hear us out! It doesn't matter if we lose the match!"

"I'll buy you something delicious afterward!"

"No, thanks."

It was unfortunate, but I had no interest in League of Spirit. To be precise, I was tired of team games. During my time in Korea, I had played 5 vs. 5 team games to the point of exhaustion and realized one truth.

'When five people gather, one of them is always trash.'

Even among those seniors, I couldn't tell who the troll would be. It was infuriating to lose because of bad team luck when I played really well. I preferred 1 vs. 1 individual play.

"Just once…"

Shaking off the senior's arm that reached out to me, I quickly quickened my pace. Sorry, but I wished they would ask Flame for such a favor.
