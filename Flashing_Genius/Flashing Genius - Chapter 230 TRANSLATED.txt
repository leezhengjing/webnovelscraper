### Chapter 48: The Start of the Semester (4)

As one travels south along the great river that cuts through the Xiaoyue Plains, they will come across the villages of the Heukmyo Tribe and the Yuwa Tribe. Historically, the frog-like Yuwa Tribe and the Heukmyo Tribe have often clashed over territory, leading to a long-standing enmity between the two tribes. However, the explorer 'Kaila' knows a tremendous secret that exists between these two tribes. 

That secret is...

"Kihyaa, this is the taste!"

If you brew alcohol by mixing the musk coffee cultivated by the Heukmyo Tribe with the black beads grown by the Yuwa Tribe, you get an incredibly exquisite vodka.

"What a peculiar human."

"Is that really tasty?"

The Heukmyo Tribe villagers clicked their tongues as they watched Kaila drinking the musk bead liquor in broad daylight.

"To not know this taste, what a pity."

A wanderer. Or a vagabond. Or an explorer. Or a homeless person. Or... a time traveler. She loved to wander the world aimlessly, but for some reason, she had been stuck in the Karakorn Mountains for a long time. It had been decades since she last tasted foreign liquor. Thanks to meeting some girls with special destinies, she was able to successfully complete her 'business' in Karakorn and returned to the world, wandering the Xiaoyue Plains and drinking as she pleased.

The Xiaoyue Plains were densely populated with various tribes, and with the development of numerous drinking cultures, one could taste as many kinds of alcohol as there were tribes. She loved this place very much.

'Hmm. It feels a bit different from the last time I was here.'

Somehow, it felt as if the cultures of the different tribes had almost merged into one. It was as if a powerful ruler had appeared and united them all into one group, but that wasn't really a big concern.

"As long as the alcohol tastes good, who cares!"

Returning to Xiaoyue, Kaila wandered around, enjoying the strongest of liquors all night long. She mainly visited places known for their famous liquors or where she could make her own. With her bronze skin and friendly demeanor, she would strike up conversations and crack jokes with anyone, easily making friends with different tribes. This was Kaila's secret to getting free drinks in foreign lands.

About a week later...

"Ugh... what?"

As usual, after passing out drunk, Kaila woke up on the street, wiping the drool from her cheek.

"Ugh, a hangover."

It felt like someone was hammering her skull. Struggling to get up, she realized she was in a very unfamiliar place. It was a place she didn't like at all. She had the [Eye of the Past], which allowed her to always see the 'history that occurred in the past' simultaneously. Because of this, she avoided places where bad incidents had happened long ago.

On battlefields, she vividly saw countless people dying, and in places where disasters occurred, she heard the screams of people in agony. No one could endure that with a clear mind.

"...Tch. I'm out of alcohol."

Despite her hangover, she wanted to get drunk quickly and stay in a daze. Struggling to her feet, she looked around. This place was a cold, desolate ruin with no sign of life. How did she end up here, even though she was drunk?

The city had been destroyed about half a year ago. Until then, it had been a vibrant city full of laughter. One day, suddenly, the mana power plant collapsed. The moment the power plant, which supplied the city with energy from mana, exploded, the scene was vividly imprinted in Kaila's eyes. Even if she didn't want to see it. Even if she turned her gaze away. Even if she closed her eyes. The echoes of the past kept tormenting Kaila.

"...Sigh."

Sitting back down, Kaila frowned deeply, feeling her head throb. 'The concentration of mana crystals in the air is thick... Is it contaminated by mana radiation?'

Mana, when it exists in an intangible state, emits beneficial energy to all living things. But the moment it crystallizes, it instantly turns into a death wave that saps life force.

'It's been about fifty years, but the concentration is still this high... If an ordinary human were to enter, they might suffer from mana poisoning and collapse, bleeding from every orifice. If it's this bad now, how terrible must it have been back then?'

Kaila walked quickly through the ruins. She didn't want to stay in such a place that ruined the taste of alcohol any longer. However, she had to stop when she saw someone blocking her path. A man with gray hair tied in a ponytail was looking at the ruins with indifferent eyes.

"It was a terrible disaster."

Instinctively, Kaila pulled out her staff and pointed it at him. A silver chain fell from the end of her staff, and a pocket watch dangled and swayed from side to side. The gray-haired man turned his empty gaze to Kaila.

"A fragment of the Silver Eleven Moon... Still wasting your time, I see."

His voice was heavy and cold, as if devoid of any soul. Kaila swallowed dryly as she met his gray gaze. The pain of her hangover had long since vanished.

"Ha, time is always on my side. Does someone as grand as the Twelve Moons have any reason to observe a mere fragment like me?"

The Twelve Moons, Huigong Siwol (Gray Sky October). The man who could manipulate the space of the world might be the most alien existence in this world. Fear crept up, but Kaila defiantly retorted.

"I heard you left the Aither World. What brings you back? Missed the wizards, did you?"

"...Fragment of the Silver Eleven Moon."

"Just call me Kaila."

"Very well, Kaila."

He looked at Kaila, or rather, somewhere beyond her, with his gray eyes.

"What scene are you witnessing here?"

"Well..."

Kaila frowned. This man knew about her ability. So why was he asking such a question?

"Just... a terrible scene."

"You must be seeing the tragedy from fifty years ago."

"Is there anything else to see?"

When Kaila deliberately spoke irritably, Huigong Siwol lowered his voice and replied as if reciting a spell.

"The tragedy from fifty years ago is not the only past. The moment you staggered in here drunk last night is also the past, and the moment a single weed struggles to take root in the cracks of the ruins is also the past."

"Why are you twisting obvious words like that?"

"One hundred years ago."

Kaila's eyebrows twitched. Besides the tragedy from fifty years ago, what happened a hundred years ago? She tried to see the scene from that day, but...

"Two hundred years ago."

"Five hundred, and a thousand years ago."

Huigong Siwol looked into Kaila's silver eyes as if piercing through them.

"The limit of the past you can see is exactly up to there."

"Uh... that's true."

Come to think of it, since inheriting the 'Eye of the Past' from the Silver Eleven Moon, she had never tried to see the past beyond a thousand years. Because it was impossible. But not wanting to lose to Huigong Siwol, Kaila gritted her teeth and shouted.

"Isn't that obvious? The Twelve Moons were born that day!"

"No. It's not obvious. Despite being able to manipulate time, why is there a limit... Have you never questioned that?"

No. She had never been happy since receiving this ability, so she never thought deeply about it.

"That's not really important."

"It is important. The fragment... To be precise, the fact that the past the Silver Eleven Moon can see is exactly 990 years ago."

"Nine hundred and ninety years..."

"Yes."

It was an exact number. The limit of the past Kaila could see was indeed 990 years. But why exactly 990 years and not a thousand?

"What are you trying to say...?"

As he kept imprinting thoughts she didn't want to know into her mind, it was starting to get annoying. She could live without knowing such things. She just needed to find her own happiness by drinking every day.

"Fate has begun to circulate. You too must return to your place."

"...You know that means telling me to die, right?"

"Death is not the end."

"That's ridiculous. It's not you who's dying, so you speak so carelessly."

"You need to return to your place at the right time."

Suddenly, Huigong Siwol's atmosphere changed drastically. The clear blue sky and clouds turned entirely gray, and Kaila felt her breath catch.

"Ugh...!"

"But this time, you are not conforming to fate."

Huigong Siwol approached Kaila, tilting his head as if genuinely puzzled or displeased by her actions.

"What is driving you to act this way?"

"Wh-what...!"

He looked up at the sky, realizing his mistake, and withdrew the gray. The weather quickly cleared up again, but Kaila was already in a bad state.

"Does it matter? It's fortunate that the Silver Eleven Moon is a coward. She divided her memories into fragments and hid them so they couldn't be found."

"Ugh, cough!"

As Huigong Siwol withdrew his power, Kaila collapsed weakly to the ground, coughing. Tears welled up, and her whole body trembled. Fear, beyond that. This was... the emotion of a prey witnessing death.

'Ah, is this the end?'

Kaila closed her eyes. She had just been freed from the Karakorn Mountains and thought she could finally travel freely. She never expected to be stopped here.

"Return to your place and do what you must."

As Huigong Siwol grasped the air, Kaila's body was sucked into the space beyond and disappeared.

Swoosh!!

He stared blankly at the spot where she had vanished, swallowing his words.

-...As always.

Step!

Turning his steps, Huigong Siwol slowly walked through the ruins. Because of the foolish Silver Eleven Moon, he had always gone through such hardships, but he always failed. However, knowing he would fail, Huigong Siwol repeated the same attempt this time as well. It was his duty and sense of mission.

Having perfectly finished his work here, Huigong Siwol crossed the space beyond and thought. Now that he had returned the fragment of the Silver Eleven Moon to its original place, the Silver Eleven Moon would follow fate and absorb it.

...However, he did not know.

"Hmm, playing Go alone is no fun."

That the Silver Eleven Moon was acting completely contrary to his expectations. No, to be more precise,

"I guess I should go play poker."

That the Silver Eleven Moon was doing absolutely nothing...

Huigong Siwol couldn't even imagine it. Fate was being twisted. By some small existence, little by little, slowly, but... drastically.
