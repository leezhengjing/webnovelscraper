# I Became a Genius in Front of the Magic School

## Chapter 270: Memory (3)

The grand altar for the purification ritual of the Morfran Forest is said to be located in the very forest where Duke Isaac Morfran went on a rampage ten years ago.

‘Such unnecessary grandeur.’

To perform the purification ritual, one had to wear ceremonial robes. These special robes, which covered the entire body, were made in the Holy Federation and were said to have excellent black mana resistance due to their special enchantments.

Twelve ritualists, six barrier mages, two grand magicians, and three mind mages followed Hong Biyeon with solemn expressions. The path to the grand altar was paved with white marble, a testament to the Holy Federation's naive belief that painting everything white would make it pure.

‘Blue is cleaner, though.’

Hong Biyeon, who had a particular fondness for the color blue, did not care much for the white robes with red stripes. Red and white were her least favorite colors.

‘By the way...’

Hong Biyeon glanced sideways. Sa Yeran Orkan, who was also wearing ceremonial robes, was walking with a pale face.

‘What are you thinking?’

Her expression was always as unchanging as a doll's. However, having faced Sa Yeran often, Hong Biyeon could somewhat discern her subtle changes in expression. Sa Yeran Orkan was in a very bad mood. Although there was no need to care about her mood, the fact that she was openly showing her displeasure meant she was significantly unhappy with the situation.

‘What does it matter?’

Since there was no point in paying attention to Sa Yeran, Hong Biyeon turned to Taeribun and spoke.

“High Priest, I have a question.”

Forcing herself to be polite made her feel nauseous.

“Yes, please ask, Princess.”

“I understand that I need to activate the Royal Family's Fire Spirit Formation. But I don't understand why. The Fire Spirit Formation is specialized in blocking rather than sealing.”

Taeribun squinted his eyes and replied to Hong Biyeon.

“Well... that's true. Princess, you are still missing one condition to perform the ritual.”

“…What do you mean?”

When Taeribun stopped walking, the magicians following him also froze like statues. Hong Biyeon tensed up and slowly glared at them.

“Princess, to participate in the purification ritual of the Morfran Forest, there is one condition. This was decided by the Queen, and even the royal family is no exception.”

As Taeribun nodded, two magicians in white robes appeared from behind, carrying a large, thin wooden box. Sa Yeran's expression visibly stiffened. Hong Biyeon could sense what was coming next but did not voice it.

Click!

Taeribun opened the box and took out a scroll, which he unfurled with a flourish.

“This is a 'Geas.' Whatever you see, hear, or feel inside, Princess, you must never reveal it to the outside world.”

“…I see.”

This was expected. She knew that all nobles participating in the purification ritual of the Morfran Forest were forcibly placed under a geas.

“Give it to me. I'll do it myself.”

The geas scroll was made with royal magic. If there were any hidden schemes within, she would quickly detect them. Hong Biyeon meticulously reverse-engineered the geas scroll.

‘Adolevit's legacy.’

It was undoubtedly Queen Hong Seryu's magic. No matter how skilled Taeribun was as a chief magician, he could not tamper with royal magic. And most importantly...

‘Who said you could use this as you please?’

She had practiced altering the formulas of royal magic circles in preparation for this moment. Although the scroll was made by the 8th-class magician Hong Seryu, Hong Biyeon, with her monstrous intellect, could slightly alter the higher-dimensional magic formulas.

Sensitive magic like a geas would lose its essence if twisted even a little. She didn't know what side effects might occur if such magic were applied to her body, but she judged that direct bloodline magic wouldn't be fatal to her. So, she took a bold step.

As she infused mana, the scroll burst into flames. Soon, a red magic circle formed in the air, enveloping and absorbing into her body in just one second. Taeribun nodded in satisfaction, thinking that no mere 4th-class novice magician could tamper with it in such a short time.

However...

The chief magician did not know. Hong Biyeon had analyzed and reversed the essence of the magic, altering and nullifying it in that fleeting moment.

But perhaps the backlash was too severe. Unable to withstand the shock, Hong Biyeon staggered and took a step back.

“Princess, are you alright?”

“Yes...”

As Taeribun approached to support her, Hong Biyeon quickly waved him off. No matter how difficult it was, she had no intention of collapsing or being supported by that old man. The dizziness and weakness that made her feel like the world was spinning were overwhelming, but she endured it with sheer willpower.

It was truly superhuman mental strength.

“…Let's go.”

Even though the backlash was enough to make an ordinary magician faint from exhaustion, Hong Biyeon forced her sweat-drenched body to move. Seeing her, Sa Yeran seemed to notice something strange and spoke up.

“High Priest, the magic activation...”

“Yes, Miss.”

Then, looking at Hong Biyeon's condition again, she shook her head.

“Never mind.”

“Hmm? Alright. By the way, Princess, the backlash from the geas seems significant. This is unusual... If you are unwell, we can delay the ritual a bit.”

“No. I can do it right now.”

Even if it seemed like she was being stubborn, she had no choice. She hated the idea of receiving sympathy from someone like Taeribun more than death.

She took a deep breath. Focus. Focus again.

‘Meditate.’

As mana permeated her body, her mind began to clear. Walking while meditating was not easy, but it was possible for Hong Biyeon. Repetition and memorization—these were her strengths. The headache subsided. Her weakened leg muscles regained strength, and the cold sweat evaporated due to the mana, bringing color back to her cheeks.

She hadn't known. Before entering Stella Academy, she had no idea how beneficial meditation could be.

‘How did I find out?’

In the midst of her meditative thoughts, Hong Biyeon suddenly recalled a memory. Early summer vacation. Flame and Angel. When she traveled with girls of different personalities, origins, and attributes to uncover Baek Yuseol's past.

One night while camping in the forest, as they all stared blankly at the campfire, she saw Angel meditating alone in a corner and asked why she was doing it. At first, she thought it was foolish. But after hearing the answer, she had to change her mind.

-Meditation? Oh, um... Baek Yuseol taught me to do this. I've been doing it ever since.

That was when it started. Hong Biyeon began to try meditation herself without even realizing it. Even without taking meditation classes, she found and read meditation textbooks and secretly practiced alone in her dormitory. As a result, she felt the overwhelming flood of mana amplifying within her body.

Already born with mana as vast as the sea, the addition of meditation created an infinite synergy. By the time she reached the grand altar, she had somewhat regained her composure, enough to use the Fire Spirit Formation.

Standing at the center of the grand altar, Hong Biyeon took a deep breath. Normally, one would practice the ritual at least once, but they hadn't given her that opportunity. It was clear they intended to humiliate her... but it didn't matter. She was confident she could do it perfectly from the start, even without practice.

‘But what is this?’

Standing on the grand altar, Hong Biyeon realized that the altar itself was shaped like a large box. There were five layers of barrier formations around it, and an additional large barrier outside.

‘Are they really trying to purify?’

The purification ritual began quietly without any signal. High Priest Taeribun stood opposite Hong Biyeon, opening a law book and inscribing runes in the air. The magicians at the twelve points raised their arms high, lifting the magic circle into the air.

At that moment, Hong Biyeon began to spin her staff.

“Flame.”

Whoosh!!

Flames rose, enveloping the altar. Pure, unrefined flames. Hong Biyeon skillfully controlled the flames with her staff.

“Protect us.”

Soon, a massive red barrier formed in the shape of a dome. Normally, shield magic couldn't be made in a curved shape. However... the ultimate barrier, developed to the extreme, could break that notion and form a perfect sphere.

The Fire Spirit Formation was one of the top ten barrier techniques in the world. Created by her ancestor Adolevit in the distant past, it couldn't be replicated with modern magic... but a talented direct descendant could recreate it.

“Oh...”

Taeribun and the purification mages looked at Hong Biyeon with slightly surprised eyes. Direct bloodline magic was something even Adolevit couldn't achieve at the age of seventeen, yet she had just received a geas and still managed to perform it flawlessly. They had deliberately set her up to fail, but she succeeded.

Some noble magicians turned their heads with uncomfortable expressions. They had hoped Hong Biyeon would fail to protect Princess Hong Siwha's secret, but she succeeded. In contrast, Taeribun looked at Hong Biyeon with pure curiosity, not seeing the situation as a problem.

‘So, this is the true Adolevit.’

Taeribun squinted his eyes and watched her. He could clearly see a red spirit-like figure shimmering behind her.

‘Disgusting woman...’

Unaware of how he viewed her, Hong Biyeon focused on her magic, sweating profusely. She had a question.

‘Why use such a great magic?’

What was the purpose of this ritual? Was it really to purify black mana? If so, why was there a need for the ultimate barrier?

“Hup!”

Pushing away countless worries, Hong Biyeon struck the ground with her staff. At that moment, the dome-shaped magic circle enveloped the altar, and the ground began to crack.

‘Ugh?!’

She almost lost her balance but managed to stay steady.

Rumble...

Then, the massive altar split in half, revealing its interior.

“Oh...”

As Hong Biyeon let out an involuntary gasp, Taeribun finally smiled and spoke.

“Princess, how do you feel?”

A chilling coldness emanated from below. Enduring the bone-chilling cold, Hong Biyeon saw the figure sealed beneath the altar with her own eyes.

“This can't be...”

Isaac Morfran. The very man who went on a rampage after turning into a black mage ten years ago and was subdued by Princess Hong Siwha Adolevit... his body was sealed beneath the altar. It exuded a cold aura as if it were still alive.

But that wasn't what shocked Hong Biyeon. If a black mage left such an aura even after death, it should be black mana. But this icy coldness was unmistakably blue mana. In other words, he had returned to being human after death.

“Why...”

“Why, you ask? I knew you would wonder.”

Taeribun took a step closer to Hong Biyeon and spoke.

“For Princess Hong Siwha.”

“What...”

“To protect the Princess, we made this choice. Every year, we seal Isaac Morfran, who keeps trying to awaken, and put him back to sleep.”

“Such madness...!”

“Madness? Perhaps.”

The old man let out a shrill laugh.

“But what can you do? No matter what madness we commit, there is nothing you can do. All you can do is complete the seal in place of the busy Princess Hong Siwha.”

Hong Biyeon quickly turned her head and met Sa Yeran Orkan's eyes. Her gaze was cold. Yes, she must have known from the beginning. The secret that lay dormant here.

‘This is...’

Suddenly, everything felt revolting. The nausea rising from within was unbearable, but she forced herself to endure it. But she couldn't. She couldn't bear it.

‘This is Adolevit...?’

No matter how much of an enemy she was, her sister, who shared her bloodline, had committed such a horrific act... and the Queen of Adolevit had kept it a secret. She couldn't believe it, couldn't stand it, and tears welled up in her eyes.

“Oh dear, it seems the Princess is quite shocked. Sa Yeran, escort the Princess down...”

“No, no. I'm fine.”

Hong Biyeon bit her lip and glared at Taeribun with bloodshot eyes.

“I will complete the ritual.”

“…Is that so?”

Taeribun looked at Hong Biyeon with cold eyes and nodded to the magicians.

“If that is the Princess's wish, I won't stop you.”

Closing her eyes tightly, she cooled her head.

‘Get a grip, it's not over yet.’

Feeling the 'Compass of Memory' hidden in her bosom, Hong Biyeon steeled her resolve. Simply knowing that Isaac Morfran's body was sealed here wasn't enough.

‘I will go back to the past... and uncover the whole truth.’
