# I Became a Genius in the Magic School's Front Blink

## Chapter 260: The Noble Soul (10)

Aither World Online. A game that had been serviced simultaneously worldwide for over ten years, boasting tens of thousands of players. It wasn't famous from the start. It spread through word of mouth as a romance fantasy genre with excellent action, attracting a vast number of gamers.

Baek Yuseol was one of the rare players who had been playing since the game's early days. Because of this, he had heard countless stories from numerous users, including many episodes related to the Twelve Moons.

The item [Bulbul Glasses] contained most of the information recorded in the Aither World community. However, there was information that couldn't be contained, such as the 'hidden pieces' that were only talked about among users.

Everyone has a desire for exclusivity. Some people want to share special hidden pieces they find in the game, while others want to monopolize and use them alone. Baek Yuseol remembered all those trivial stories that were only rumors.

The main story in the game? There were many old players who didn't know it. So many. If you asked a seven-year-old veteran about a character named 'Flame,' they might respond with, 'Who is that?'

But the information in the game was different. Veterans collected and memorized every piece of information, never forgetting it. Baek Yuseol was one of those cases. While raising the highest difficulty character, he had to spend dozens of times more effort to clear even the bosses that others easily defeated.

'Eunse Shibilwol.' The most famous and mysterious of the Twelve Moons. Despite many players trying to uncover information about it, there was almost none. Fortunately, Baek Yuseol obtained rare information through someone he knew.

*...Who was that again?* He seemed to have frequently encountered and played with that person since the game's early days. He didn't know their real name or face, but he remembered their ID was 'Dalso.' When he once asked about the meaning of the ID, he got the reply, 'It doesn't mean anything,' a common ID.

One day, that person said, 'Hey, Baek Yuseol. I found out something about the Twelve Moons this time.' At that time, the Twelve Moons had little influence on the main story and almost no known rewards, so it wasn't popular. So Baek Yuseol would have replied, 'I don't care.'

But the other person persistently talked about the existence of the Twelve Moons. 'The Twelve Moons are actually derived from the progenitor wizard. Did you know that?' Some people might have known. It was common knowledge that came out just by reading the main story. Unfortunately, Baek Yuseol didn't know and wasn't interested. He was busy looking for opponents for duels, so he tried to answer perfunctorily, but then the person brought up something quite interesting.

'If you find the Twelve Moons, your character's stats can permanently increase, or you might gain new skills.' It would be a lie to say that didn't pique his interest as a gamer. Especially since 'Character Baek Yuseol' had a hard time acquiring useful skills as a blink specialist.

'Want to hear more?' At that moment, Baek Yuseol ended his match and listened to the story. It was amazing how that friend knew so much, and it was a great help to Baek Yuseol. He was able to raise the first character on the server to receive the 'Blessing of the Twelve Moons.'

The first Twelve Moon Baek Yuseol contracted with was 'Geumgang Chilwol (金剛七月).' It perfectly offset the worst penalty of not being able to cover his skin with mana, which prevented his durability from growing permanently from zero stars. From then on, he became very interested in the Twelve Moons. He collected, shared, and strategized information related to them through secret routes, even deleting and re-raising characters to contract with the Twelve Moons.

In that process, the help of his game friend 'Dalso' was significant. Dalso secretly shared information about the Twelve Moons with Baek Yuseol, and by combining those small hints, he was able to contract with several of the Twelve Moons.

However, there was one Twelve Moon that even Baek Yuseol repeatedly failed to contract with. Eunse Shibilwol. Unlike other Twelve Moons, it didn't stay in one place, wandering freely and living a carefree life, making it difficult to persuade and contract with.

Is this the hardship of a salesperson? 'Isn't it more like a dating simulation? True to the game's identity.' ...Thus, Baek Yuseol invested several months to攻略 Eunse Shibilwol.

'How did it go?' Flash. He opened his eyes. The face of Yiphanel, dyed in purple, came into view. She still looked peaceful but had an uncomfortable expression. A system message floated before his eyes. 'Concentration?' It was a status effect he had never seen before. Had his recovery and circulation rates increased? He hadn't noticed at all. He hadn't been injured, nor had he felt the circulation rate because he was wandering in the mental world.

"...This isn't easy." He had tried all day to awaken Eunse Shibilwol's ability, but the more he wandered in the mental world, the more the power of Yeonhong Chunsamwol was strengthened. Of course, it wasn't a bad thing. The fact that he was growing so quickly meant that he hadn't been able to utilize even 1% of Yeonhong Chunsamwol's power until now, and it was starting to grow explosively.

But he was frustrated because he couldn't grasp how to manifest Eunse Shibilwol's blessing. No one in the game had ever unlocked Eunse Shibilwol's true power...

Flinch. "Huh?" While lost in thought, Yiphanel's fingertip trembled. Was it an illusion? It passed by so quickly that he couldn't see it properly. "Yiphanel? Are you awake?" There was no answer. She was still asleep, not moving at all.

'What is this?' He felt a sense of incongruity. A very, very slight... something that felt off. It was a sense of incongruity that he wouldn't have noticed normally, so Baek Yuseol sharpened his senses and slowly got up, circling around Yiphanel.

Something had changed. However, he could only sense that a change had occurred, not what it was. "This is..." He slowly brought his head closer to Yiphanel. Something seemed to be visible, or not. He reached out his hand. The faintly purple, translucent barrier surrounding Yiphanel was particularly annoying to his eyes.

As Baek Yuseol's fingertip was about to touch the purple barrier. Shiver!! A chilling sensation ran through him, sharpening his nerves. But he didn't react hastily. Rash actions could make the situation worse. Instead, he withdrew his hand and spoke to the air. "How long are you going to keep spying from there?"

In the past, he wouldn't have noticed, but now his senses were sharp. Thanks to the blessing of Yeonhong Chunsamwol, he could vaguely sense it. "Oh my, how did you notice?" Surprisingly, a voice came from the seemingly empty air. When Baek Yuseol slowly turned his head back, a woman appeared there.

'...Black Magician.' The clear mark of a 'Black Magician Contractor' displayed on the Bulbul Glasses. Even without the glasses, it would have been easy to recognize her as a Black Magician. The purple horn on her forehead, the purple skin, and the even darker purple tattoos were proof that she wasn't an ordinary Black Magician.

Click-clack! Wearing a tight leather jacket, she walked gracefully like a model and spoke. "Hehe... It's our first meeting, right? I've heard a lot about you. I didn't expect to meet you here."

It was their first meeting. But recognizing her identity wasn't difficult at all. * Black Magician Contractor * Real Body Clone * Curse of the Spirit The 'Curse of the Spirit' clearly displayed on the Bulbul Glasses. It appeared when one killed a spirit and was cursed by the heavens...

Currently, she was a prime suspect in the murder of Yiphanel. 'If her name doesn't appear...' It was probably because her name never appeared in the original game. Information unknown to players wasn't recorded here. But was there a need to know her name? Just knowing her identity was enough to raise Baek Yuseol's tension.

'A clone body.' There must be a reason why she sent a clone body instead of coming herself. Probably, the reason was... 'She can't enter this place.' Baek Yuseol narrowed his eyes. Real Body Clone. It seemed simple, but it was a perfect cloning technique that only a few wizards in the world could use. Cloning techniques were rare, and even if used, it was usually impossible to move with will, but she was controlling it with her soul.

A normal wizard wouldn't notice. Baek Yuseol could vaguely sense it with the help of Yeonhong Chunsamwol, but he only realized it was a clone because the Bulbul Glasses told him. 'I'm still far from matching the glasses' senses.' Well, it hadn't even been a day since he awakened his abilities, so trying to catch up with the glasses was too ambitious.

'I mustn't underestimate her.' There was too much he didn't know about her. Since there was almost no record even in the Bulbul Glasses, he had to be very cautious in the mental battle. So, Baek Yuseol deliberately acted nonchalant and said, "A coward who doesn't even have the courage to come here in person, what do you want?"

"...Oh my, a sharp kid, aren't you?" "Do I look like a kid to you?" "Hmm..." Outwardly, he looked like a teenager. To a Black Magician who had lived for over a hundred years, he would be less than a sprout, but if his appearance was a deception, the story would be different.

'Hmm, what is this?' The woman, Soya, narrowed her eyes. Even though it was a clone body, her senses should be more than 90% identical to the main body. But she couldn't feel any special energy from Baek Yuseol. No, that made it even more suspicious. Soya slowly circled the garden with Baek Yuseol at the center, like a model walking.

She couldn't sense any mana from the boy, which was common among other wizards. She relied more on her mana senses than her vision, but Baek Yuseol felt like a mirage that didn't exist even though she was looking at him. "You're quite interesting." "It would be troublesome if you fell for me." "Hehe, why? Do you already have someone?" "Someone very strong that you can't handle."

Such a woman didn't exist in this world, but Baek Yuseol said anything to buy time. "So, what did you mean by that earlier? I'm here in person, aren't I? I could kill you right now." Baek Yuseol chuckled and spread his arms. "Then, come and try. If you can."

Soya extended her fingers. Mana slowly emerged from her purple nails but didn't shine brightly. 'With this level of mana... will it work?' Her senses were similar to the main body, but the mana she could use was limited as a clone body. 'A kid whose identity is unknown.' Moreover, she had heard stories about Baek Yuseol. He had dealt with several high-level Black Magicians and recently killed the descendant of the 'Last Witch,' making his fame widely known.

'Is such a monstrous guy... really a high school student?' Were humans all brainless? How could they confine such a guy to the status of a high school student? 'Of all times...' She bit her lip slightly, so Baek Yuseol couldn't see. It was good to check Yiphanel's condition, but she had encountered a bad opponent. If it were an ordinary 6th-class wizard, she could easily kill them with a clone body, but Baek Yuseol was uncertain.

Having confirmed that the Elf King Ggotseorin had visited the Third World Tree, she had to avoid a major battle. "...What do you want?" Reluctantly, she withdrew all her mana and took a few steps back, asking irritably. Only then did Baek Yuseol smile. 'It worked.' The fact that he could recognize a clone body, the mana leakage delay, and the reputation he had built up helped deceive her to some extent.

Of course, rash actions were forbidden. If provoked too much, she might suddenly turn and put a blade to his neck. Black Magicians were easily enraged. "What I want... I don't have anything like that, but I'm curious about something." When she urged him with a nod, Baek Yuseol hardened his expression and spoke. "In the past, you killed the spirit Yiphanel and absorbed her heart. Right?"

She remained silent with a stiff expression, but Baek Yuseol continued. "But in the process of absorbing the spirit's heart... something went wrong. To put it crudely, you got indigestion. You tried to digest a powerful energy that didn't match your level all at once." "You'd better watch your mouth." He tried to speak as carefully as possible. The thought of her attacking Yiphanel made his tone a bit sharp.

"So you came back to properly absorb that energy. But... it seems you still haven't found a way. Am I right?" She bared her white fangs slightly, showing hostility, but soon calmed down. For a Black Magician, that was excellent anger control. It was commendable. 'Disgusting.' The sight of a Black Magician controlling her emotions was unpleasant to Baek Yuseol, but he endured it.

"So, what do you want?" "It's simple." When Baek Yuseol extended his finger into the air, a subspace tore open. Soya was startled and almost stepped back but held on with superhuman patience. 'A subspace?' A space magic that only a high-level wizard could use, how could a high school student use it? Before she could question it, Baek Yuseol took something out and threw it to her.

"This is..." "It's an item from a Black Magician. Find and kill that guy. Then I'll help you fully absorb the heart. Consider it a commission fee." "What... really? How?" It was hard to believe, but the opponent wasn't an ordinary high school boy. He was special in some way... maybe he really knew how to fully absorb the 'spirit's heart.'

Soya lowered her head and looked at the item Baek Yuseol had dropped. It was an old shoe. But it felt like an ordinary shoe with no trace of black magic. 'You can't feel anything, can you?' Of course. It was just trash. "...Who do I have to kill?" Finally, tempted by his offer, Soya asked, and Baek Yuseol smiled. "Cheolriban. Kill that man."
