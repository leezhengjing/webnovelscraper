## Magic Academy: The Genius Who Appeared Before the Academy 274 - 52. Practical Training (3)

There were many words to describe Fullame. Excellent student, beautiful appearance. Well-behaved, physically gifted. Truly a woman of many talents. However, she had one fatal flaw: teamwork. Given the nature of group projects, where team members divide roles, handle their assigned tasks, and then combine their results, it’s common sense that simply fulfilling one’s role is enough to be considered a valuable member. But Fullame was inherently incapable of that. 

Fullame, the queen of networking, had already extended her connections to not only first-year students, but also second and third-year students. It was unthinkable for her to have problems with interpersonal relationships. Perhaps it was because she had already experienced university life during her time on Earth, or maybe it was due to her habit of handling everything on her own. 

There was a time when she was even accused of “not trusting her teammates.” However, nowadays, if you were grouped with Fullame, it was guaranteed that you would receive an A+ for that assignment regardless of how much work you put in, making her highly sought after. 

“……Fullame, are you trying to hunt the monster by yourself?” 

“Yes. Is it not allowed? If it isn’t, then let me do it.”

“No, what…?” 

Fullame, an ace student, was already a standout figure even in this place where A-class and S-class students applied for missions. Several A-class students had even approached her, requesting her to join their groups. It was unclear why they were all male students, but Fullame turned down all their requests and finally submitted her mission application alone. 

She could have chosen to collaborate this time, but she avoided it for a simple reason – points. These ‘practical mission’ classes heavily reflected on the students’ final grades, and she thought it would be better to score high by hunting a high-ranked monster by herself rather than engage in mediocre collaboration. 

“No, it's not forbidden… The school knows that you reached 4th-class, right? But you haven’t received your official 4th-class certificate yet.”

“That’s right.”

“So, the level of monsters you can challenge is significantly lower.”

“Well, wouldn’t it be easier if the level is lower? I’ll just defeat it casually.”

“Oh, really… Okay, I understand. You want a high-level monster, right? Should I pick the one with the highest difficulty among the monsters you can challenge alone?” 

“That would be greatly appreciated.” 

However, the assistant, flipping through the mission list, scratched his head as if he hadn’t found a suitable mission. 

“There aren’t really any monsters that you can challenge alone. The challenging monsters are all already taken by groups of three or four. And even those are only 3-risk.”

“Then, there’s nothing?” 

“There is, but…” The assistant showed Fullame the mission list. All of them were missions like hunting 2-risk monsters or defeating a large number of low-level monsters. Those missions were annoying but not difficult, making it hard to earn significant points. To earn a high score, one needed to defeat a monster of 3-risk or higher through collaboration. This was impossible for a solo challenge.

“Ugh, this is frustrating…” Fullame was frowning at the mission list when Feng Harang suddenly intervened, pointing at the mission list. 

“This, are you interested in doing it with me?”

“Huh?” Fullame hadn’t even considered the mission [2-risk Giant Bear Elimination] because it was too simple. 

“No? It’s not fun to do it alone, why do it with me? It’s fine if you’re someone who enjoys spending time together, but you’re not even entertaining.”

“……I may not be entertaining, but I can be your reliable backup.” 

“No, I don’t want anyone to see my backside.”

“Then how about this?” Feng Harang, looking only with his eyes, stared at the assistant. His gaze was so sharp that the assistant involuntarily flinched.

“What happens if there are any unforeseen circumstances during the mission?”

“Unforeseen circumstances? What kind of…?” 

“For example, what if the monster is stronger than indicated?”

“W-well, usually they’d give extra points in that case.” If a mission is deemed more dangerous than originally described, the magic warrior has the right to give up the mission. Alternatively, if they choose to continue, they will receive extra compensation for the increased risk, along with an additional bonus. In other words, completing a mission marked as ‘3-risk’ is worth fewer points compared to completing a ‘2-risk mission that turned out to be 3-risk’.

“Huh… Are you trying to say…?” Fullame looked at Feng Harang with suspicion, who silently nodded. 

‘What’s this? Is it really a 3-risk mission?’ Fullame carefully read the detailed mission list, just in case. 

［Location: Southern Plains］

“Ah.” Then she realized. Feng (風) Empire. Feng Harang, a direct descendant of the Feng family, ruled over the entire Southern Plains. If he wanted, he could easily modify the details of the Southern Plains missions. 

Of course, he couldn't go beyond the given task, and the assistant would be monitoring him from behind. However… It would be a piece of cake for him to find a 3-risk mutant Giant Bear. 

‘This is tempting… But going on a mission with Feng Harang is unsettling.’

“What do you think? Are you interested now?” 

“No.” So, she gave him a blunt answer. Even if Fullame was obsessed with points, she wouldn’t fall for such an obvious trick. It wasn’t like she had no idea what he was up to, but lately she had been very concerned with romance, making her extremely sensitive to the actions of male students. 

Yes, she knew exactly what Feng Harang was trying to do. Therefore, she had to cut him off immediately.  Accepting his scheme, taking advantage of him, and then kicking him away when he was no longer useful would be worse than trash. If there was no feeling, it was proper etiquette and respect to politely refuse his kindness. 

“……Are you uncomfortable going on a mission with just the two of us?”

“What?” Feng Harang’s words surprised Fullame. 

“Don’t worry about that. I already considered your discomfort. I knew you would refuse.”

“O-okay…”

“Then how about this. We raise the ‘unforeseen circumstances’ level to 4-risk.”

“4-risk? Is that even possible?” 

“Yes. On top of that, you can pick anyone you want to bring along. You don’t have to shoulder everything by yourself, there are plenty of suitable talents for collaboration. For example… Bai Yusuel.” 

Fullame was visibly surprised, her voice slightly raising. 

“Why is her name coming up all of a sudden?”

“Just… I thought you might want to bring her along.”

“That’s not happening. I’m definitely not bringing Bai Yusuel.”

“No need to be proud…” 

“I’m telling you, I’m not.” 

Fullame snatched the mission list from Feng Harang’s hand and started flipping through it. It was obvious she was trying to hide her flustered expression, but he didn’t mention it anymore.

“There are still a few guys who haven’t signed up properly. So, are you really going to bring others?”

“Yes. Anyone is fine.” 

‘Anyone’ would be better as long as it wasn’t Bai Yusuel. Fullame suppressed her true feelings, waiting for Feng Harang to make his move.

“Hey!! Anyone want to earn a ton of points with me?!”  **…9!!”  Before Feng Harang could react, Fullame jumped onto the central platform, waving the paper and shouting loudly. 

“What?”

“That’s Fullame?” 

“Let’s go earn points?”

“I’ll go.” 

“Hey, don’t go. That girl is crazy. Who knows what kind of crazy things she’ll do?”

“Why is she crazy? She’s just kind.” 

“You’re too naive. She’s just putting on an act.” Some A-class students, despite wanting to approach her, hesitated. The noble forces of A-class, who still resented Fullame for being a commoner in S-class, were significant, forcing commoners to submit to their will. This prevented them from acting freely. 

While other S-class students were choosing their desired missions, they were left staring at each other, unable to make a move. 

Hae Wonryang was the first to step forward in front of Fullame.

“Oh, you’re doing this?”

“What kind of mission is it?”

“It’s marked as 2-risk, but there’s a possibility of ‘unforeseen circumstances’ occurring. The mission could become very, very difficult. Are you still willing to do it?”

“The mission will get harder…” Hae Wonryang immediately understood Fullame’s intentions.  There was no way he, the one who always chased after the top spot, would refuse such a tempting opportunity.

“It seems interesting. Are all the ‘unforeseen circumstances’ included in your calculations?” 

“Ah〜 Of course not.”

“I’ll do it.” 

“Good! Next! Anyone else?”

As soon as Hae Wonryang stepped in, Ma Yusung, like a leech, immediately approached Fullame. 

“Monster hunting? Is it fun?” 

“Well, it’ll be more enjoyable than the mission you’ve chosen.”

“Okay then, I’ll do it. The one I chose is too boring.”

“Oh, I like it. So, next? Anyone else?”

With Ma Yusung joining, Hae Wonryang’s face crumpled, but there was nothing he could do. The moment he agreed to join, it was practically guaranteed to end this way. 

“Well, is there anyone else? Let’s sign up then.” Fullame, jumping down again, ran to the assistant, adding Ma Yusung and Hae Wonryang’s names to the mission application. 

“Feng! This team is fine, right?”

“….Yes.” Feng Harang stood behind her, silently staring at Ma Yusung and Hae Wonryang as they followed, sighing. He hadn’t expected a mission with just the two of them. However, he had hoped that she would have an opportunity to shine, hoping she would have the chance to prove herself. 

But he couldn’t believe that the two worst rivals he disliked the most ended up joining her. 

‘…I’ll just have to work harder.’ He had already prepared himself for the fact that winning Fullame’s heart wouldn’t be easy. But he would do his best within his limits.  

Even if he fails in the end. He would accept it calmly. 

“This team is certainly impressive.” The assistant, speechless, stamped the mission application.  A team consisting entirely of top ten students in their respective grades. He was more worried about the monster they would face, whoever it might be.

“Well… I don’t think it’s necessary, but since it’s a mission, you need to go through the mission orientation. Head over to this classroom.”

“Okay.” 

Feng Harang left first for the classroom, followed by Ma Yusung and Hae Wonryang bickering, and Fullame, after glancing at them, whispered to the assistant.

“That… Can I add someone else after applying? It’s not that many, just one more…?”

“Hmm? Well, it’s not impossible. Who are you thinking of adding?”

Fullame, after a moment of hesitation, discreetly looked at the A and S-class mission application list. 

［Persona Gate］
［S-class Bai Yusuel, S-class Hong Biyeon］ 

Fullame’s pink lips were slightly chewed, their shape slightly distorted. 

“No.  I don’t think I need to add anyone else after all. I’ll be going.”

“Oh, okay… I wonder why.  Just now, that girl was so cheerful and energetic, but something must have happened to make her so down.”  The assistant read through the mission application list Fullame had been looking at, but couldn’t figure out the reason. All he could think was that her personality was truly unpredictable.
