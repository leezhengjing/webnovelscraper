# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 191: Everything is Frozen (4)

A system message, invisible to others, appeared in front of Bai Yuseol. Since they were merely walking between the ice cliffs, the others might not have even realized they had entered a dungeon.

"Hmm. The atmosphere has changed."

"The concentration of mana has settled."

"It seems like something is about to appear..."

However, whether it was just Bai Yuseol's illusion or not, he quickly noticed the change like a veteran, even without the help of the system message.

"Oh, this is a bit interesting."

"Indeed. It's my first time coming down to the bottom of the sea."

As they squeezed through the crevices of the sea, heading deeper into the abyss, the party members could observe the frozen reality of the underwater world. Normally, one would think only the surface of the sea would be frozen, but this place was different. The sea below was completely frozen and still.

"That's... a hexagonal shark."

"I heard it went extinct seven hundred years ago, but here it remains, frozen."

"Wow. It's like a living museum."

Perhaps because the landscape had been frozen for a thousand years, they occasionally spotted monsters and marine creatures that could no longer be seen in the present. Bai Yuseol found the sight quite fascinating, as he had never paid attention to such details while playing the game.

"Hmm, something's coming ahead."

"Prepare for battle!"

Despite this, Bai Yuseol was well-versed in the strategy for this dungeon. He had previously posted a series of strategy guides titled [★Yuseol's Dungeon Strategy#001★] on community sites, which had received considerable acclaim. While he was terrible at character analysis and story, he was a specialist in monster and dungeon strategies, befitting an RPG gamer.

Most of the adventurers who joined this strategy expedition to gauge his combat abilities were greatly disappointed when Bai Yuseol took command from the rearmost position.

"Leader~ The plan is messed up~?"

Even the leader of the Myeolamdan, Kaen, was no exception. If he couldn't confirm Bai Yuseol's combat prowess, he wouldn't have supported such a dungeon strategy expedition in the first place.

"We will proceed in this direction next. Please be careful not to make any noise."

However, one thing was clear. His judgment was sharp and insightful, far beyond what one would expect from a seventeen-year-old student. He made unique yet cautious decisions, as if he had been to this dungeon before, which initially caused some adventurers to rebel.

"What? Why are we crawling in here? It looks dangerous at first glance!"

"Look closely at the direction of the flowing waves and footprints. Also, the mana flow is unusual. According to my analysis, this is..."

"Geez. You speak so complicatedly like a student from a prestigious school. So, what are you saying?"

"If you don't trust me, I will respect the opinions of the veteran adventurers and go this way."

"Yeah. That's more like it!"

Veteran adventurers had sharp instincts. Although they hadn't studied dungeons as professionally as Bai Yuseol, they had their own experience surviving in such fields. Therefore, they couldn't fully trust the words of a bespectacled kid, and Bai Yuseol, understanding this, readily accepted their opinions.

The result?

"Crazy! Why is a Crystal Giant Golem appearing here!"

"We have to assume it's at least a 7-risk level!"

"Crazy, what do you mean fight it! Retreat! We can't face it in this narrow canyon!"

If they didn't follow Bai Yuseol's words, such incidents would inevitably occur. Fortunately, Bai Yuseol had anticipated such situations and secured a retreat route in advance, showing precise command, allowing them to get through without significant damage. After several such incidents, no adventurer dared to defy his words anymore.

"Phew, nothing here works as expected..."

"Indeed. What is that kid's true identity?"

"Whenever we ask, he just says, 'I studied mainly from textbooks'..."

No matter how much one studies theory at a desk, such command and judgment are impossible. In fact, relying on such knowledge often leads to confusion in unexpected situations. Bai Yuseol was indeed a unique case.

However, Kaen and Hyeijin, who knew in advance that Bai Yuseol was not an ordinary student and possessed a unique analytical ability called 'Deep Learning,' were not surprised. Compared to his potential combat power, such abilities were just a minor aspect.

Bai Yuseol ensured the adventurers took long breaks to preserve their stamina. Even if they said they didn't need rest, he made them take 30-minute breaks, during which they had no choice but to nap or snack.

It was strange to see veteran adventurers, who had been in the field for 10 to 30 years, obediently listening to a student's words, but after experiencing his remarkable insight, they had no choice but to accept it.

The dungeon led them deeper into the abyss, and although no light penetrated, it was not dark at all. A mysterious blue light emanated softly from the frozen sea, which stood like towering walls on either side.

"There's something in the sea."

One adventurer broke the silence with a remark. Everyone agreed but didn't want to think about its identity. What could emit such a bright blue light in a sea frozen for a thousand years? It was something beyond human understanding.

Bai Yuseol knew its identity well.

'The entrance to the Frozen World...'

His true objective was to reach the forbidden realm where the Ice Titan and spirits lived, a place no living being could approach.

Screeeech-!

"Ugh! My ears!"

"It's an Ice Spirit."

"It's been a while since I've seen a spirit..."

"It's strange to see a spirit here. Is there a spirit totem?"

"Wow, it seems really angry. It thinks we've invaded its territory."

Spirits were still a mystery in the magical world. No one knew where they lived, what they ate, whether they slept, why they sometimes made contracts with wizards, or how they were summoned. Nothing was properly revealed.

So, when a spirit suddenly appeared in the dungeon and showed hostility, the adventurers felt uneasy but forced jokes to lighten the mood.

However, Bai Yuseol couldn't laugh in this situation.

'Why are the spirits here already?'

Originally, this dungeon didn't have spirits. Only peculiar monsters exposed to the power of the Ice Spirits, like frozen deep-sea monsters or fish, appeared frequently. The spirits themselves never showed up.

'...Something has changed.'

From now on, he couldn't proceed based on the knowledge he had. Places he thought were safe could be dangerous, and vice versa.

"Let's take a short break."

"Good. This time was a bit tough."

"A golem directly controlled by a spirit. We have another story to tell over drinks."

"Hey, don't you know that people who say such things are the first to die?"

"What nonsense! Don't jinx it."

While the adventurers chatted and relaxed, Bai Yuseol kept looking somewhere.

'The Boss Room.'

The final destination of this dungeon. The deepest part of the abyss, connected to the heart of the vortex. Once they entered there...

They would face the 'Guardian of the Ice Valley,' a spirit in armor, and if they won, they would receive tremendous rewards and open the entrance to the Frozen World.

'Is it really okay to go in?'

When he played Aether World Online, he knew the strategy well enough to clear the dungeon alone with his character, Bai Yuseol. But since the spirits started intervening directly, the difficulty had skyrocketed.

His strategies no longer worked, and he had to rely on the adventurers' quick judgment several times. Bai Yuseol trusted their experience. However, he couldn't bring himself to lead them into a potentially deadly situation.

'...I can't do it.'

With the dungeon's difficulty abnormally high, he couldn't take the adventurers into the boss room, unsure if they could succeed.

"Everyone, please pay attention for a moment."

"Hmm?"

"Yes, young leader."

"Speak up."

Their playful tone remained, but now the party members fully respected Bai Yuseol's judgment. It was unfortunate, but the trust they had in his judgment was based entirely on his past experience and his meticulous glasses...

He couldn't continue to show such impressive leadership. Therefore, Bai Yuseol had no choice but to make this decision.

"The party disbands here. I will go to the boss room alone."

"What?"

"Wait a minute..."

"What is this kid saying?"

"I didn't expect the variable of spirits in this dungeon. Spirits... are an area I can't fully grasp, and you all might face great danger. Instead, I promise to share all the rewards from clearing the dungeon with you."

Though he spoke firmly, he didn't fully understand the veteran adventurers' feelings.

"Geez. This kid is quite arrogant, isn't he?"

"So, you're disbanding the party out of concern for us?"

"Afraid someone might die?"

"Hahaha!"

The adventurers' unexpected reaction left Bai Yuseol puzzled.

"Kid, being an adventurer means living with death as an occupation. No one knows when or where they'll die. I acknowledge your sharp mind. You're smarter than us and seem to have studied a lot."

"But... don't think you've understood the world with just knowledge. This is a different matter."

"From the moment we set out on an adventure, we put our lives on the line. Many comrades left without a farewell and never returned."

"This dungeon has been quite an interesting experience. If I survive, it will be a great story to tell over drinks. But now, you're telling us to turn back?"

"Crazy! What could be worse than this!"

"One of the proud moments of my life would instantly turn into a dark history. Even if there's a risk of death, I must enter that boss room."

"We know you have another purpose, but we can't accept this."

The adventurers' pleas were filled with words Bai Yuseol couldn't fully understand. To him, living was the most important thing, and risking one's life for something was still a distant concept.

Therefore, he couldn't respect the adventurers. But if he couldn't respect them even after they spoke so earnestly, he would be a heartless being.

"...Understood. Let's all go in together."

"Haha! Good!"

"Everyone, if you've rested enough, let's get up!"

As the adventurers stood up with enthusiastic faces, Hyeijin, who had been hiding at the back, made a sad face.

"Sigh. I thought we were going back..."

Just as adventurers risked their lives for adventure, Hyeijin risked her life for hunting dark mages. But since this wasn't a dark mage hunt, it might seem like a pointless death to her.

"Leader... can't we go back?"

"No. We're going in too."

Kaen wanted to see Bai Yuseol's true abilities with his own eyes. If the boss room was dangerous, it was a good thing. If a variable occurred there, Bai Yuseol would have no choice but to reveal his true skills.

"Alright. Let's go in!"

Thus, the final gate of the dungeon, the boss room, was opened. With the adventurers' burning passion and camaraderie, the next steps were set.

A fierce battle with an unimaginably powerful boss! Amidst the struggle, a blossoming camaraderie and solid bonds! Though the opponent seemed impossible to defeat, they would eventually win, leading to a heartwarming conclusion!

Everyone expected such a story. Bai Yuseol, the adventurers, and even Kaen.

But...

As soon as the dungeon entrance opened, a tremendous blizzard rushed in, making it impossible to open their eyes properly.

"Ugh, what is this!"

-ROOOOAR...!!!

Something roared. The adventurers instinctively knew it was the monster guarding the boss room. It was indeed a peculiar situation.

"The boss... is coming out of the boss room!"

"What, what? Crazy!"

A boss never leaves the boss room. That's common sense. But sometimes, such common sense is broken, leading to a 'Dungeon Break.'

A terrible phenomenon where the dungeon, left unattended for too long, causes internal anomalies and monsters to spill out.

"...Damn, we must stop it!"

"There's no turning back now!"

The adventurers retreated and set up a massive barrier to withstand the blizzard, raising their staffs.

Thud! Thud!

As a giant ice monster, at least 50 meters tall, took steps forward, everyone swallowed nervously. But no one thought of running away.

"Rather... it's thrilling, damn it."

"Yeah, it's just what I expected!"

"What do you mean expected! Think rationally! We can't properly face it in this blizzard!"

"Retreating is impossible! The rear is too narrow. We have to face it here, enduring the blizzard!"

"Damn it!"

Kaen also retreated slightly to act like the adventurers and observed the surroundings. Then, by chance... his gaze fell on the boss room.

'What is that...?'

Inside the boss room, there was something strange. The space was swirling, looking like...

'A portal?'

Why was there such a thing in the boss room? One thing was certain: the blizzard was emanating from that portal. It would be great to block the portal, but approaching it in this blizzard was madness.

The adventurers must have noticed the portal by now. But no one said they would head there. 'Death.' It's a different story from risking one's life in a fight. Approaching that place meant certain death. So, everyone hesitated.

'...No choice.'

Kaen decided to step forward himself. If he used his full power, this blizzard and ice monster wouldn't be a problem.

[Teleport]

But someone else moved first.

"Huh, huh?"

"That crazy kid, what is he doing!"

It was Bai Yuseol. He ran towards the portal without looking back, and the adventurers tried to stop him, but he was already too far.

Kaen realized. That was Bai Yuseol's true objective.

"Hyeijin, follow him!"

"Huh? Huh? Leader, I can't withstand this... Ah?!"

Kaen grabbed Hyeijin and used super jumps to break through the blizzard.

Flash!

Chasing Bai Yuseol, who disappeared through the portal, Kaen also threw himself towards it.

Whoosh...

Immediately, the blizzard stopped. Silence fell.

"Crazy..."

Even with the ice monster in front of them, the adventurers were too shocked to speak.

"Did he... jump in to stop the blizzard?"

It was something anyone could have done, but no one did. The adventurer's question echoed through the canyon, but no one could answer. It just reverberated, filled with countless emotions.
