## Chapter 282: The Genius Who Became a Blink in Front of the Magic School - 53. Shadows Cast by the Wind (3)

The mission of the Full Flame team, originally a 2-risk Monster Bear hunt, had become a 4-risk mission with the appearance of three giant Monster Bears due to an ‘unexpected development’. But it was smoothly finished by cleanly eliminating them without any variables.

"How's it going, Instructor? We deserve extra points for this, right?" 

"……Yes."

The instructor, who had followed to supervise and assist the Full Flame team, pushed up their glasses and shook their head. They knew this was going to happen, but they couldn't believe they actually managed to hunt down three 4-risk Monster Bears from their lair. They knew these students were extraordinary, but this was probably the first time they'd encountered such exceptional 1st-year students.

*Bang!* *Crack!* *Rumble…*!!

As the instructor calculated the points, they heard a booming sound and shook their head. 

"Whew…They're bored and singing, and it's noisy over there."

The 2nd-year S-class, Dokcheolkwang. They were supposed to supervise the 1st-year students, but they seemed unable to contain their excitement after witnessing them hunt down three 4-risk monsters together. They had apparently already gone into the forest and made a kill. 

A moment later, Dokcheolkwang reappeared, covered in bright blue blood, dragging a monster's corpse behind them. It was the corpse of a 'Monkey Ogre,' usually considered a 4-risk monster, but known for its ability to climb trees freely, making it incredibly difficult to hunt.

"You crazy…You took that down by yourself?"

"Haha! I caught three more, but my hands are full so I couldn't bring them back. This should be enough for dinner tonight!"

"……Why are you eating that? Dokcheolkwang student. We're planning to have a normal, human-like meal for dinner."

"Hah, Instructor. You're not being very manly. A true magician should eat the flesh of the monsters they hunt, so their experience and passion can accumulate within their body!"

"……Sure, whatever." The instructor gave up on trying to reason with Dokcheolkwang and turned to Full Flame.

"Anyway, you passed and we'll be giving you extra points. The professors will decide your final score, but you can expect an A+."

"Ah, yes! Thanks!" Full Flame grinned with a cheerful face, and seeing her bright smile, Punharang felt happy too, and casually suggested:

"It's finished earlier than expected. Before we return from completing the mission, would you like to visit the capital of Punjeuk?"

"Oh, really? Will you give me a tour?"

"I'm not sure if we'll have time for a full tour…but we could do some sightseeing."

"Ah, then can we visit your house?"

"……My house?" Full Flame's innocent question made Punharang slightly flustered. The only place he could call his home was the 'main branch of the Pun family,' which was currently the royal family, and it was difficult to allow ordinary people inside. Of course, he could take her if he wanted, but his standing in the family was quite low, so even these small things felt like he was stepping on toes.

‘But…' 

"What do you think? If not, then we can't."

"It's okay. It's not that big of a deal." It was her request, and a little bit of shameless audacity wouldn't hurt. 

"It might not be so interesting for the other two…Are you alright with that?" 

He asked Mayuseong and Hae-wonryang, and they nodded.

"Pun family…I'm quite interested."

"Me too! I've never been to a friend's house before."

Punharang's eyebrows twitched at that unexpected word.

"……We're friends?"

"Yeah. We even went on a mission together, so I think we can call ourselves friends, right?"

"That's ridiculous. That's not friends, it's colleagues."

"We're not official magic warriors yet, right? So I think the term 'colleague' doesn't suit us." Mayuseong chuckled and said, and Punharang turned his head away.

"Think whatever you want."

The instructor ignored the students' carefree behavior. It wasn't uncommon for S-class students to break the rules, and this was just a childish, lighthearted play session, so they simply let it go.

"But don't spend too much time. Dokcheolkwang student. Stay behind and look after the 1st-year students until you return."

"Hm, that sounds boring." Dokcheolkwang grumbled but nodded. It was because they remembered Bandiyeon's scolding to obey the instructor's words.

With the instructor gone, the Full Flame team rode the automated carriage that Punharang had prepared in advance and entered the capital of Punjeuk, Taeyusan. 

"Wow…" Full Flame looked around the city with sparkling eyes. 'A familiar feeling…!' 

Punjeuk, with its oriental atmosphere, was a country she'd been attached to since reading the original novel. Though most of the characters in that country were not popular, and their information wasn't properly listed on the wiki, Full Flame remembered the details of Punjeuk's setting.

‘They say it's progress disguised as conservatism.’

The original novel's reader cafe, '[Don't Fall in Love with the Unfortunate Lady]' had a member who enjoyed political satire, and their comment, "Progress disguised as conservatism," became quite famous even among those who disliked political topics, becoming the one sentence that encapsulated Punjeuk.

On the surface, Punjeuk seemed open and welcoming to foreigners, but beneath that facade, there was a sense of superiority based on their belief that Punjeuk's traditions were the most superior in the world. 

But regardless of their internal views, Punjeuk's culture itself was undeniably beautiful, and that was enough for Full Flame to give it a passing grade. She was ready to enjoy her sightseeing trip.

"We've arrived."

The driver announced, and Full Flame instinctively reached for the door, but Punharang stopped her.

“Huh?”

When she looked around, she noticed Mayuseong and Hae-wonryang were also sitting still, waiting for something. Suddenly, the door on the right side of the seat where Full Flame was sitting opened. It wasn't an automatic door. The driver, who had announced their arrival, quickly ran over and opened the door for them. 

"Oh, come on. Were you guys waiting for this?"

She asked with a bewildered expression, and Hae-wonryang and Mayuseong nodded. 

"Is something wrong?" 

Seeing the two male students genuinely confused about what the problem was, she felt like the fool instead.

"The life of the rich…." Full Flame shook her head and stepped down, but she gasped at the sight before her. 

Hanok village, Gyeongbokgung Palace, Gwanghwamun Gate, and more. It seemed like every oriental palace she knew had been combined into one enormous, breathtaking scale, right in front of her.

‘This is…Seoldegung, the palace of the Pun family…’

With a single gesture from Punharang, mages dressed in oriental robes lowered their staffs and parted to the sides. The huge red gate creaked open.

"Go in."

Following Punharang, who walked ahead, Full Flame excitedly looked around, but she couldn't turn her head because Hae-wonryang playfully pushed her head from behind. 

"You'll break your neck."

"Oh? Right."

Realizing how childish and awkward her actions were, Full Flame belatedly straightened her neck.

She thought they wouldn't be using any more vehicles since they had already gotten off the automated carriage, but that wasn't the case. A private carriage for riding within Seoldegung was waiting for them. While walking towards it, Punharang suddenly saw someone and froze, his fingertips trembling. 

"Huh? Why? Is something wrong?"

Punharang stopped, and Full Flame, who had stopped behind him, leaned forward to see what was ahead.

"You're here, Harang."

"……Yes. Mother."

There stood a woman wearing a silver silk dress, with the same eyes as Punharang. She looked at the area behind Punharang and smiled, saying:

"You brought your friends."

"There's no need to be so nervous. I'm glad you came at this time."

"……What does that mean?" 

Full Flame finally remembered the relationship between Punharang and his mother. 'I heard this mother doesn't really like Punharang.'

Punharang had two older brothers and one older sister. His eldest brother was closest to inheriting the family, but he had lost in a political struggle recently and was currently under house arrest. This meant…this mother had lost the only one she trusted and supported, and now she had nothing to rely on.

The mother approached Punharang and warmly held his hand with both hers.

"The daughter of the Star Cloud Trading Company, Jelliel, is visiting Cheolhugung."

"……What does that have to do with me?"

"All the other 'brothers' are stationed abroad, so there's no one to greet her. You greet her. It's not a difficult task, and it won't take long."

"So you're telling me to just be a pretty face?"

“That's not what I meant.”

"Will that change your position? The Seven Winds families bowing down to a mere merchant, is that really the right thing to do?"

Punharang raised his voice, forgetting that Full Flame was behind him, but his mother replied without changing her expression.

"It's the right thing to do. It's true that it will change my position. She needs help from the Wind families, and no one else can offer it. If you can help her…that alone would be a great benefit to our 'Pun family'."

He'd almost forgotten. He had already given up his pride long ago. Probably ever since his eldest brother was put under house arrest.

"……Understood. I'll go."

After responding, Punharang realized that Full Flame, Mayuseong, and Hae-wonryang were watching. He turned around and bowed to them in apology. 

"I'm sorry. I wanted to introduce you to the traditions of the Pun family, but something urgent came up."

"Oh? Oh yeah, it can't be helped if you're busy. We can have fun here without you…."

"Wait, maybe we can join in?" 

"…..Huh?"

Hae-wonryang chimed in before Full Flame could try to appease him, because he felt sorry for Punharang.

"Join in…Yes. I might not be much on my own, but I'm known as the heir of the Full Moon Tower. If I accompany you, it will help your position as well. …We're 'friends'."

It was true. Punharang had nothing to offer and no clout, but being friends with Hae-wonryang would surely earn him some favor with Jelliel. Jelliel had received help from the Full Moon Tower in the past, and her father was very close to the Tower Master.

Hae-wonryang's words made Mayuseong nod his head three times, his eyes shining.

"Jelliel of the Star Cloud Trading Company…I want to meet her too."

"Oh? Then I do too!"

"Haam…Hm? Do I need to answer too?"

"Go quickly, Senior Dokcheolkwang."

"Ugh, boring. Fine."

From Hae-wonryang to Full Flame and Mayuseong, they all wanted to go. They couldn't officially take them to the meeting, but it was Jelliel's personal request for a simple favor, so it wasn't a big deal.

"It's alright. Take your friends."

His mother, having heard Hae-wonryang's status, seemed hesitant but ultimately agreed, so there was no reason to refuse anymore.

"……Alright. Let's go."

* * *

Meanwhile, in Cheolhugung. Jelliel stared blankly out the window, basking in the sunlight. As a high elf, she could absorb enough nutrients from sunlight to last for days, but she wasn't doing this pointless act simply to get nourishment, especially since she always ate a high-quality diet.

‘This is a headache.’

She frowned and surveyed the distasteful sight of Cheolhugung. 

‘This wasn't the plan.’

Her initial goal was simple. She heard Baiyusuel was briefly visiting Taeyusan in Punjeuk to carry out a mission, so she planned to quietly visit her and say hello. However, the driver had mistakenly forgotten to remove the Star Cloud emblem from their automated carriage, and as a result, the Seven Winds families came rushing out to greet her, making her situation awkward.

She didn't enjoy being treated like royalty. She had a strong desire for money, but she didn't care about fame. If anything, she felt quite irritated. Every time she saw those royals bowing down to her because of her wealth, she felt like she was being tricked. 

‘I should be gone…'

She didn't know when Baiyusuel would finish her mission and exit the Persona Gate. But the royals believed she had a 'great reason' for coming here, and they insisted on offering excessive treatment, even going so far as to gather all the Seven Winds families for a grand assembly. Fortunately, she managed to avoid that disaster by swiftly declining their proposal.

Did they even know? Her 'great reason' for coming here was simply to see a 1st-year student from Stella.

She had temporarily pushed them back with a flimsy excuse about needing a small favor, but she still didn't know what to ask for. Was there even anything the Seven Winds families could help her with? 

The only people she wanted to find in this world were Eunsesip Ilwol and Baiyusuel. None of the Seven Winds families seemed to know their whereabouts.

‘…Just buy some time.’

Even if I just ask for anything, they won't be able to help me. Then I can politely decline and leave.

‘Time is money.’

She was worried Baiyusuel might have already left while she was wasting time, and Jelliel paced restlessly. But no matter how hard she tried, time didn't go faster. 

The clouds of Punjeuk seemed to know her feelings and moved slowly, as if teasing her.
