# I Became a Blink Genius at the Magic School

## Chapter 152: Magic Survival (4)

Magic Survival was the highlight of the inter-school competition, but the number of students each school could send was inevitably limited. Stella Academy consistently produced an unusually high number of participants each year, with at least five and up to seven students joining the competition.

If the story had followed the original game, nearly ten participants from Stella would have been expected this year. However, due to some twists in the story, only seven students from Stella participated in this year's Magic Survival. Of course, this number was still significantly higher than other schools, but since the Magic Society, which hosted the inter-school competition, conducted internal reviews of the participants, no one questioned the fairness.

Stella was Stella, after all. Such a situation was simply accepted.

**Boom! Rumble... Swoosh...!**

Dark clouds gathered, and a downpour began. It was a climate change caused by the virtual reality manipulation of the Stella Dome. Midway through the competition, the survival area had shrunk to half its original size.

**2nd Year Class S, Dok Cheol-gwang.**

"Haha, that was an interesting duel."

"Ugh... Zen, Jang..."

He laughed heartily as he looked at the fallen student from another school in front of him. Known for his exceptional physique and muscular build, he was an expert in 'Magic Combat,' fighting with magic circles wrapped around his fists. As a renowned one-on-one combatant, most opponents tried to avoid him. Those who couldn't avoid him ended up like this, eliminated.

The student named Merild, who was eliminated and expelled, left with a final remark.

"Damn, those Stella bastards..."

Flash! He turned into light and disappeared. Dok Cheol-gwang scratched his head awkwardly.

"Well, I didn't do much."

Stella was notorious for sending strong contenders every year, and as a first-time participant, Dok Cheol-gwang felt it was unfair. The competition was only halfway through, yet many students had already been eliminated. In the early stages, frequent encounters with enemies led to constant skirmishes. However, in the mid-to-late stages, kills became less frequent as participants finished farming artifacts and quietly took their positions.

"Tsk, the boring time has come."

For Dok Cheol-gwang, it was a truly dull time. Fights, more fights! A survival tournament should have that kind of thrill, shouldn't it? Hiding and strategizing to win was incredibly boring to him.

For that reason, Dok Cheol-gwang studied strategy and tactics. To defeat his enemies? No, that wasn't it. It was for a very simple reason.

'To find out where the enemies are hiding.'

In his mind, he could already picture where the sneaky rats might be hiding and watching him.

"Oh, something interesting is happening."

Sensing a skirmish in a nearby city, Dok Cheol-gwang didn't hesitate to move. There was nothing more exciting and enjoyable than jumping into a melee!

* * *

If you truly want to win a battle royale, there's something you must absolutely avoid: standing out too much on your own. An overwhelmingly strong presence becomes a target for many. Although the basic rule is to fight alone, when a powerful common enemy appears, participants often form silent alliances to eliminate that enemy.

This is why those with the title of 'strong contender' rarely win each year.

**Baek Yuseol.**

He was particularly one of the strong contenders. The inter-school competition required participants to be at least seventeen years old. However, the average age of participants was usually between eighteen and over twenty, as it took at least a year of practical experience to be ready for real combat.

For this reason, Baek Yuseol, who participated in the intense and fierce Magic Survival at the age of seventeen, naturally became the center of attention.

"...Isn't that guy completely insane?"

A cadet from Master Descartes Academy, Hanabon Yu, couldn't hide his astonished expression as he watched Baek Yuseol fighting fiercely from a distance. Even though he was expected to face intense scrutiny in the later stages, he was causing a commotion in a densely populated city area.

"Moreover... isn't that blatant teaming?"

Teaming was not only against the rules but also the most hated act by the audience because it made the game boring. While it was common to focus fire on a public enemy to eliminate them first, such blatant cooperation was absolutely forbidden.

But the funniest part was...

'Why can't three people take down one?'

Without special vision-related magic or learning magic vision, it was impossible to see the situation at a glance.

'Isn't he alone?'

Boom! With a loud explosion, Baek Yuseol soared high into the sky but soon used blink to disappear to the ground.

"...That's amazing."

A wizard who controls blink. Even a great wizard couldn't do that. Baek Yuseol was toying with his enemies, showing mobility as if multiple people were moving, appearing on the rooftop of a building on the left, suddenly popping out from a collapsing bridge on the opposite side, and leaping from a window below.

**Whoosh...!**

While watching the battle in a daze, a sudden wind blew.

"Ugh, this is...!"

An unusual airflow. Confirming that Baek Yuseol and the three Stella cadets fighting from a distance were hiding in different buildings, Hanabon Yu quickly hid inside a cave.

A natural disaster. Also known as 'Lailnaje's Tsunami.' It was a peculiar phenomenon where a storm of lightning swept through, caused by the collision of magical energy and the energy of the earth in special places in reality. In Magic Survival, natural disasters were set to occur at specific times, so participants had to evacuate in advance.

**Crackle! Crackle, crackle!**

Soon, a tremendous storm of lightning swept through the area. Although it didn't cover the entire field, it was enough to engulf the city where Baek Yuseol was fighting.

During a natural disaster, the standard procedure was to hide, so by now, they would have stopped fighting...

"Huh?"

At that moment, a kill log message suddenly appeared.

"What, what? Did they hide in the same building by bad luck...?"

In a one-on-one fight, Baek Yuseol couldn't be defeated, so it was possible. But then, Baek Yuseol's kill log appeared consecutively. This meant he had eliminated all the enemies attacking him...

'How?'

It was an incomprehensible phenomenon for Hanabon Yu. 'The Lailnaje's Tsunami is still raging outside... It was large enough to cover the entire area, so Baek Yuseol shouldn't be able to move easily either. But how did he find and kill all the enemies hiding in different buildings?'

**Whoosh...**

As soon as the Lailnaje's Tsunami subsided, Hanabon Yu quickly dashed outside. There might be another battle, but his intense curiosity outweighed his desire to win.

Running swiftly, he arrived at the city where Baek Yuseol and the three enemies had fought together, but...

"...Nothing."

There was nothing left but the traces of the battle. Suddenly, the cheers from outside the arena seemed to reach him. Having eliminated the enemies who had annoyed the audience with their cheating and teaming, the spectators were probably shouting Baek Yuseol's name at the top of their lungs.

'Tsk, is Stella the protagonist again this year...?'

Hanabon Yu didn't like the Stella students for various reasons. After all, even the three boys who attacked Baek Yuseol were all from Stella Academy. Why did Stella always do such annoying things? From the beginning, he didn't like the title of 'the world's best magic academy.'

'...In that case, should I aim to kill Baek Yuseol instead of winning?'

No matter how strong Baek Yuseol was, after more than ten kills, he would be physically exhausted, and his supplies would be depleted. In contrast, Hanabon Yu had conserved his strength and gathered equipment and supplies, so he could fight in top condition.

Since Baek Yuseol's flashy one-man show had made winning meaningless, why not monopolize the attention by killing him instead?

'No matter how strong Baek Yuseol is, he'll show a gap when he's exhausted!'

From that moment, Hanabon Yu began to pursue Baek Yuseol. It wasn't difficult to track him as he left noticeable traces wherever he went. Every place he visited had a battle, and each time, Baek Yuseol secured a kill. He frequently visited densely populated areas, making it difficult to hide and causing a lot of trouble.

"Hmm?"

While maintaining a suitable distance and pursuing Baek Yuseol, he discovered something quite strange.

"What is that?"

**Crackle, crackle...**

Black flames were burning the field. However, it didn't feel like they were simply burning some material... It felt like they were burning the space itself. It was strange. The Magic Survival stage was implemented like reality, so the magic used here had similar effects to reality. Fire would burn wood, be extinguished by water, not easily catch on stone, and clash with lightning. Such interactions should occur just like in reality.

But those black flames seemed to be burning the magical space itself. Looking closely, it felt like 'reality' was slightly visible beyond the peeled space.

'Could it be that the Stella Dome was peeled off by magic?'

Given that the space was created by the 9th-class wizard Eltman Eltwin, it wouldn't easily collapse with just those flames. However, the fact that the virtual space itself was burning filled him with a strange sense of fear. How powerful must the magic be to burn the virtual space? No, there was only one possible explanation.

'Could it be a black wizard...?'

The only beings capable of exerting their power even in a virtual space were black wizards. But even so, it didn't make sense. What kind of insane black wizard would cause terror in a school competition where all the wizards' eyes were focused?

...Thinking that, he corrected his thoughts. From the beginning, the mental state of black wizards couldn't be evaluated by normal human standards. There were black wizards who blew up entire buildings in the middle of a city just to kill one person, and others who caused a commotion and committed suicide to tarnish the honor of the Magic Tower.

Beings devoid of human emotions. They threw away their lives for immediate pleasure and excitement. Such beings were black wizards.

'...Stay calm.'

If a black wizard had indeed infiltrated Magic Survival, Stella would have noticed. They might be annoying and despicable, but they were still the world's best magic institution.

'I need to retreat for now.'

He didn't know who the user of the black flames was, but he felt it was best to stay away. It was a primal instinct.

At that moment.

"Aaahhh!!"

From beyond the swirling flames, he heard a scream. Instinctively checking the source, he saw a girl crawling on the ground with her body on fire. And another boy chasing her. The boy, with a peculiar hairstyle resembling flames, held black flames in both hands.

"Haha, why are you running away? Does it hurt? Aren't you a magic warrior cadet? You should endure this, right?"

"Ugh, ugh...!"

The girl, with black flames on her body, seemed to be in real pain, squeezing out tears and snot.

'What is this?'

It was an unbelievable sight. Feeling pain inside the stage? That was impossible. Hanabon Yu instinctively checked the name tag of the wizard wielding the black flames.

'Berenkal.'

An unfamiliar name, a strange uniform, and... an alien gaze. Just from the pressure of his magic, it was clear.

'The opponent is a predator.'

At least a 5-risk level. An opponent that students participating in Magic Survival couldn't possibly handle. To deal with a 5-risk black wizard, several professional magic warriors would be needed.

'I need to help...'

If he didn't help, the girl burning in flames might really die. But...

'...What can I do?'

Hanabon Yu had just entered the 4th class at the age of nineteen, but he could barely use it. It was extremely difficult to demonstrate his full potential in a one-on-one fight. Charging at the black wizard in this state would be a futile death.

While Hanabon Yu hesitated, hiding behind a rock, Berenkal chased the crawling girl and shouted.

"Hey, a warrior shouldn't be so scared, right? Stand up and fight properly. Aren't you a magic warrior? A magic warrior meant to fight black wizards. Why are you acting so pathetic?"

It sounded like he was talking to himself, but he couldn't do anything.

"Ugh..."

Not all students at the Magic Warrior Academy fought black wizards. Most students, like Hanabon Yu, aimed to graduate from a prestigious elite magic school and build a career in a safe and good job. He never thought he would encounter a black wizard in his life.

'What should I do...'

With trembling hands, he covered his mouth and tried to think of a solution. Suddenly, he felt something like a rocket brush past him.

**Boom!!**

With a loud explosion, thick fog rose where the black wizard had been standing. As the fog cleared, the figure that emerged was none other than Dok Cheol-gwang from Stella Academy's 2nd Year Class S. His instructor had emphasized memorizing his face as a strong contender, so he recognized him immediately.

"Haha, I felt something suspicious and came to check... and there really was a suspicious guy using suspicious magic?"

**Thud! Thud!**

As Dok Cheol-gwang clapped his hands, Berenkal, who had retreated, dusted himself off and stood up. Despite the strong impact, he had only minor scratches.

"Hah, this is... I was planning to hunt Baek Yuseol before he got eliminated by others, but a special treat came to me instead?"

"Hmm! My body is muscular, so it won't be tasty!"

The opponent was a black wizard. A very strong one. Anyone who saw this situation would realize it. But... Dok Cheol-gwang, knowing this, still smiled confidently.

'This is ridiculous...'

He would lose. Dok Cheol-gwang, though a genius who had reached the 4th class at the age of eighteen, couldn't defeat Berenkal alone. He must know this better than anyone, yet he still smiled.

Dok Cheol-gwang looked at the girl behind him and extended his fist. **Bang!** A sharp spear shot out from his fist, piercing the girl's chest.

"Ah..."

Since there was no pain from Dok Cheol-gwang's magic, the girl closed her eyes peacefully and soon turned into light and disappeared. She was eliminated, so the wizards outside would soon notice her injuries. There might be some aftereffects, but she would probably survive with treatment.

"Hah, what are you doing?"

"What else? I did what a magic warrior should do. Now that the obstacle is gone, let's enjoy ourselves."

He then clapped his fists together and added.

"By the way... I've never been knocked down in my life."
