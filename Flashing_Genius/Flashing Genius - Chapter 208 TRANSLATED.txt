# I Became a Genius in the Magic School's Frontline Teleportation

## Chapter 208: Old Story (4)

9th Class. The pinnacle of magic. The supreme realm. The limit of humanity. This realm, which resonates differently from the start, cannot simply be judged by numbers. An ordinary person who knows nothing might say, "Isn't the 9th class just after the 8th class?" but that is not the case at all. There is a huge wall between the 8th and 9th classes. To put it simply, the gap between the 1st and 7th classes is the same as the gap between the 8th and 9th classes. The difference between a 1st class mage who has just started walking the path of magic and a 7th class mage who has reached the pinnacle of the magic world is enormous. It might seem exaggerated, but it is an accurate expression. A 9th class mage is such a transcendent being that calling them a mage is almost embarrassing.

They have glimpsed fragments of the 'truth' that exists in this world and have gained special enlightenment. They no longer handle magic as a skill or mathematics but as a natural phenomenon. There are fewer than ten 9th class mages in the Aether World. The reason for this ambiguous number is that no one in the world knows exactly how many 9th class mages there are. A 9th class mage can defy the laws of nature, reaching a level where the lifespan of their physical body becomes meaningless. Some of these beings have hidden in the shadows of the world, making it impossible to find them anymore. Therefore, no one knows the exact number of 9th class mages.

The Tower Master of the Full Moon, Grand Mage Haeseongwol, is one of the few 9th class mages active in the magic world, along with Eltman Eltwin. The story of how he suddenly built a huge magic tower in the middle of the 'Saren Desert,' where life cannot survive, and created a massive oasis to root life, is already famous enough to be included in textbooks. Although he is much younger than Eltman Eltwin at the age of 100, Haeseongwol has accumulated countless achievements like a tower and has had a variety of experiences.

However, even for him, this situation was a first.

"So, you want to entrust the command of the exploration team to that boy?"

"Yes."

Haeseongwol could not understand Zeliel's judgment at all. Entrusting the command of this important mission to a mere teenage boy, especially when her father is missing, seemed insane.

"You must be out of your mind."

"No, I am more sane than anyone right now."

"Alright. His name was Baek Yuseol, right? I've heard of him recently because of his quite interesting actions. But so what? The mages present here are at least as good as, if not better than, Baek Yuseol."

"I know that too."

"No, you don't. Baek Yuseol, who has achieved accomplishments comparable to those of genius mages of his age, might seem impressive. But in the end, he is just a teenage mage aspirant who hasn't even graduated from school yet."

Haeseongwol's words were reasonable. In fact, anyone would think the same. Baek Yuseol is undoubtedly smart. Many mages have said that he will make a mark in the magic world in just ten years. However, Baek Yuseol still lacks experience. Despite his deep knowledge and intelligence for his age, he has no real experience outside of school. Although his achievements in repelling dark mages several times as a student are impressive, they are just a few instances. Most of the magic warriors present here have at least dozens of experiences in defeating dark mages and are experts in handling various mysterious cases, including disappearances. Entrusting the command to Baek Yuseol in such a situation could be seen as an insult to the careers and pride of the experts.

"I understand your intention, but I cannot agree with it."

When Haeseongwol concluded firmly, Zeliel lowered her gaze. After a moment of silence, she slowly raised her head again and met Haeseongwol's eyes.

"Tower Master."

Her eyes, devoid of any emotion, were empty. Haeseongwol felt a sudden chill as he met her gaze.

"Speak."

"I know that much."

"…Yes, I suppose you do."

Although overshadowed by Baek Yuseol, Zeliel also possessed a brain worthy of being called a genius of the century. Not only was she exceptional in the field of magic, but she also achieved tremendous success in the business world at a young age, proving her intelligence.

"I am currently assessing and thinking about the situation more calmly than ever. If it means finding my father, I am willing to sacrifice even my soul."

Haeseongwol realized he was wrong. He had thought Zeliel's eyes were devoid of any emotion, but that was a complete misunderstanding. She was appealing with emotion. A calm judgment? Nonsense. Zeliel was currently overwhelmed by emotion and unable to make a proper judgment. This realization made Haeseongwol's heart sink.

"This child is appealing with emotion?"

It was hard to believe. Although her father might not know, Zeliel was a child without any emotion. No matter how much she hid it and acted like an ordinary person, she could not deceive the eyes of a great sage. Haeseongwol, who had watched her since childhood, knew this moment was unbelievable. What had changed her? Was her father's disappearance a great shock to her? No, something was different. Something very intense had stimulated her for a long time, and it had recently exploded, finally giving emotion to the machine-like Zeliel.

"…If that is your wish, I will bend my will this time."

With Zeliel pleading so earnestly, Haeseongwol, as a friend of Melian, could not refuse. Thus, an unprecedented phenomenon occurred where a student of Stella was to command the elite 'Black Team' of the Full Moon Tower's magic investigation team. Although the mages of the Full Moon Tower might have had complaints, none of them showed any signs of dissatisfaction. It was not because they had no complaints but because they fully trusted Haeseongwol's judgment and knew how to restrain and hide their emotions as mages.

"This is quite burdensome."

Although Baek Yuseol had wanted this situation, he felt slightly burdened when he actually had to command them. Moreover, with the 9th class Grand Mage Haeseongwol watching the situation directly, he could not easily open his mouth. However, Baek Yuseol, bearing the family name of Yeonhongchunsamwol, had a shameless personality, so it was not a big problem.

"What do you plan to do now?"

When the mage who originally commanded the Black Team asked, Baek Yuseol glanced at the prepared magic equipment and said, "We need the alpha version of the Spirit Rate. The MPM value should be over 3, and the sampling rate should be over 300,000."

"Why do you need the Spirit Rate? If you plan to trace the magic power, give up."

Although Baek Yuseol's suggestion was quite novel, the mages of the Full Moon Tower had already tried all possible methods. They would have mobilized all possibilities without regard to means and methods.

"We also tried, but we couldn't get any results."

Melian's disappearance was undoubtedly a magical phenomenon. The investigation team of the Full Moon Tower had installed all kinds of magical tools to analyze it, focusing on magic. They analyzed the flow of mana over the past month, what magic was used, what attributes were in flux, and what traces existed. The flow of mana inevitably left traces, and the investigation team of the Full Moon Tower had the excellent technology to catch all of them. However, no matter what magical tools they used, they could not obtain any information. It was as if a higher-level mage had played a prank.

"I won't try something that senior mages have already attempted."

"Then?"

"Can I tweak the spell code of the Spirit Rate a bit?"

"…Go ahead."

Although Baek Yuseol was immediately questioned whenever he tried to do something, it was not because they disliked him. It was a reasonable question about whether it was really necessary for the entire precious team to move.

"As you all know, every human has a unique wavelength in their soul."

"That's just a hypothesis. It's almost impossible to measure the wavelength of a soul directly."

"It might be impossible for other mages. But with the technology of the Full Moon Tower, it should be theoretically possible."

"…What?"

The Full Moon Tower had very special magical tools that existed only there. However, they had not yet fully utilized their performance.

Thud! Whirrr!!!

"…What, what is this?"

As Baek Yuseol manipulated the magical tool a few times, a strange sound hummed, and the machine started operating. The fact that a clear blue light came on was evidence that it had captured something. He finally tapped the machine with his palm and said, "From now on, we will trace the location of Carmen Set, who disappeared with Chairman Melian's soul."

Angel and Flame. The two girls ventured out to find the sacred relic of Silver Eleven Moon and successfully joined the exploration team led by Gerawin in the Karakorn Mountains. Although both were 4th class mages, the exploration team members, who were anxious because they were too young and inexperienced, soon stopped complaining after a few days.

"Alright, everyone, get ready for a mess in five minutes!"

As Flame banged a ladle and pot, the exploration team members lined up with their trays. Angel watched the scene with her mouth agape in astonishment.

"Wow, she's really amazing in many ways…."

The exploration team members, being veterans, initially treated Flame and Angel as mere porters, not engaging in proper conversations or assigning them roles. However, Angel showed no complaints and actively stepped forward to solve problems whenever there was a monster attack or when entering dangerous areas. Moreover, Flame displayed even more advanced social skills, mending the team members' clothes with her various skills, fixing light equipment with a spanner, and taking full responsibility for cooking during meal times. Her stamina and diligence were impressive, but it was also a mystery where she learned such skills. Normally, students from prestigious magic schools like Stella could only use magic.

"Hey, you're good at cooking too, right?"

"Yes? Well, yes."

Thanks to her traits of being a 'Jack of All Trades' and 'Versatile,' Angel excelled at such tasks. Although Flame's cooking skills were so professional that it overshadowed her, Angel was still very capable.

"Wow, these Stella kids are surprisingly useful."

"Right? I'm glad we brought them."

"I still can't believe we're eating proper meals on a mission."

Angel assisted, and Flame cooked, creating meals that were of such high quality that they could be sold in a professional restaurant. Although the ingredients were mostly wild, making the quality slightly lower, it was still a feast compared to the thin porridge or jerky they used to eat.

Even after the meal, Flame's role did not end.

"Hey, Stella kid. My robe's contact circuit seems to have a problem. The mana shield is flickering…."

"It's a circuit connection error. Just a moment. Angel, can you fix it? I need to carve this."

"Yes…."

Both Angel and Flame studied alchemy as a minor. Perhaps it was thanks to watching the genius alchemist Baek Yuseol up close that they could handle such small tasks with ease.

"Haha! Thanks! If anything happens, I'll protect you!"

"Oh, thank you."

Their versatility and skills were very helpful to the exploration team, and their outstanding looks brightened the team's atmosphere, making their presence grow day by day. Although they had to run around busily during their rest time to build such rapport, it was worth it.

"Hey, kids. You look good."

"Sister Kyla. Do you need anything fixed?"

"No. Want a beer?"

"Uh, we're still on a mission."

The soft light from the temporary campsite on the mountainside glowed faintly. With magical barriers set up, the smell and light hardly leaked out, so there was little worry about monsters finding them. However, drinking alcohol carelessly was still quite dangerous.

"Then I'll drink alone."

"No, you shouldn't. Please hold off during the mission."

When Angel snatched the beer from Kyla's hand, she smacked her lips.

"I didn't raise you like this…."

"When did you ever raise us?"

After finishing the cleanup, Flame and Angel prepared to go to bed. Thanks to handling all sorts of chores, the two girls were not assigned to the night watch. However, Kyla, who seemed to dislike the night watch, complained.

"Ah, but at least it's the first watch."

She plopped down on the ground and looked up at the sky.

"Hey, kids. Do you see that constellation?"

Angel and Flame simultaneously looked up at the sky. The stars, shining much brighter than in the city, filled their view. It felt like they were floating in a sea of starlight.

"It's beautiful."

"…That's not the point."

Noticing something, Flame frowned. Stella taught various survival skills, including how to identify stars to determine one's current location, coordinates, and time. Therefore, something seemed off.

"Uh… what…?"

"Did you just realize?"

With a bewildered look, Angel covered her mouth with both hands and slowly uttered the unbelievable reality.

"The constellations in the sky… are rotating backward?"

"Yes, that's right."

Kyla chuckled and said, "The deeper we go into this mountain range… the more we might be walking towards the past."

Her words sounded like a beautiful verse from a poem, but unfortunately, it was the reality of the moment. Angel and Flame could not even respond.
