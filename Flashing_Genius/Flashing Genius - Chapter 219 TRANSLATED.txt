### Chapter 219: Old Stories (15)

Angel and Flame continued to follow Bai Yuseol's movements. A day passed, and the departure ceremony arrived. Bai Yuseol, dressed in the uniform of Morphe, attended the event. There, Isaac met with wizards from other factions: Adolevit, the Wizard Association, the Tower Union, the World Wizard Organization, and countless other major magical forces.

"This is... what is this...?"

Angel remembered that during his childhood, the power of the Morphe Grand Duchy was quite formidable, comparable to the Adolevit royal family. However, the sight before him seemed like an attempt to check the power of the Morphe Grand Duchy.

"So, that's how it was... Father was under pressure from external forces."

Hong Shihua had used some kind of 'bait' to gather all these people here.

"I need to find out more."

The wizards gathered in the command tent were all so prominent that even Angel and Flame found it difficult to meet their gaze. Bai Yuseol stood confidently in the command tent, while Isaac Morphe and Hong Shihua Adolevit led the meeting. However, it was less of a meeting and more of a one-sided verbal attack aimed at finding any flaw in Isaac Morphe.

"How can they do this?"

Angel looked at Hong Shihua with an angry expression. They had invaded the Morphe Forest with such a large army under the pretext that the Morphe family's barrier had weakened. Was this diplomatically right?

"It doesn't feel real."

"Reality is often more fantastical than movies."

Of course, Isaac did not just sit back and take it.

"We must seriously address the rudeness of the Adolevit royal family. After this matter is settled, we will meet again in an official capacity."

His words carried significant weight, causing the other wizards to cough and avert their gazes, realizing the gravity of their actions. No matter how much they used Hong Shihua as a shield, they could not escape Morphe's wrath if something went wrong.

However, Hong Shihua seemed completely unconcerned with Isaac's anger. The conversation grew increasingly heated. Hong Shihua even referred to Bai Yuhuo Hualing as a 'war weapon,' enraging Isaac. Despite his strong rebuttals, no one listened to him, as if they had their own firm beliefs.

It seemed Hong Shihua thought it was time to steer the conversation in her favor.

"We have a different perspective on this demonic beast."

"A different perspective?"

"Yes. We discovered that the legendary demonic beast, Bai Yuhuo Hualing, possesses a value that is absolutely forbidden in the magical world."

As the conversation continued, Bai Yuseol had already disappeared.

"Huh? When did she leave?"

As they looked around, the conversation took an even stranger turn.

"A forbidden value... Are you talking about the 'Mana Crystal'?"

"I didn't say that."

"Even if you didn't say it, I understand your implication, Princess Hong Shihua."

Mana Crystals. They appeared at a very low probability from high-grade demonic beasts and had energy efficiency and power hundreds of times greater than ordinary mana stones, making their price unimaginable. In the underworld, they were used for another purpose: 'Mana Capacity Expansion.' Wizards who felt their limits would absorb the mana crystal of a demonic beast. Naturally, it was dangerous. While a few wizards showed results from Class 1 to Class 3, most could not withstand the demonic beast's mana and became 'Dark Wizards.'

Despite knowing this, wizards continued to reach for mana crystals, aware of their own limits.

"There are stories that the mana crystals from higher, purer, and more concentrated demonic beasts can amplify even more mana. Is that what you came for?"

The wizards averted their gazes, and Hong Shihua remained silent, staring at Isaac before finally speaking.

"On the contrary."

"Contrary?"

"Yes. We recently discovered a method to mass-produce mana crystals from demonic beasts."

"Haha. So, you want to say that after sealing Bai Yuhuo Hualing, you will mass-produce mana crystals?"

He joked, but no one laughed. Isaac began to understand why they had united.

High-purity mana crystals. They were like drugs, illegal and dangerous, yet highly coveted by the powerful.

"I don't need to hear any more. I need to find Bai Yuseol."

Having grasped their sordid truth, it was time to find Bai Yuseol. Fortunately, Flame and Angel had their souls linked to him, allowing them to quickly locate him.

"I'll go too."

"Yes, this way."

They flew through the forest in their ethereal forms, passing through walls.

Crash! Crack!

"Ugh?!"

Suddenly, a living branch brushed past their eyes, startling them and almost causing them to fall.

"This is... a Living Tree."

Angel felt a cold sweat as he looked at the wriggling Living Trees around him.

"Up there, it's him."

Looking up, they saw Bai Yuseol sitting at the top of the highest Living Tree, gazing into the distance. As they flew towards him...

"I have no intention of fighting you. In fact, I came to save you."

There stood an unexpected figure.

"Professor Raiden...? Why is he here...?"

Flame, knowing Raiden's true identity, frowned, while Angel, unaware, was dumbfounded.

"He's a Dark Wizard."

"What?"

"That man is a Dark Wizard. See the mark on his chest?"

He proudly displayed the emblem of the 'Dark Wizard Church,' as if to flaunt his identity.

"Wizards, once again consumed by greed, are about to bring disaster to this world. We Dark Wizards do not have such things. You call us Dark Wizards and label us as evil, but it's the opposite. You have always threatened the world, and we have always saved it from the shadows."

"Disgusting Dark Wizard...!"

Angel wanted to punch that hypocritical face. The sight of a Dark Wizard, the world's pests, claiming to save the world was utterly repulsive.

"Why don't you say something...?"

But Bai Yuseol remained silent, merely pointing his staff at Raiden.

Strangely, Raiden did not seem eager to fight Bai Yuseol, perhaps knowing that a proper clash would leave neither unscathed. He seemed to have another purpose.

After a while, Raiden turned into mist and disappeared, leaving Bai Yuseol staring at the sky. It was a night with unusually deep stars.

---

That night, Angel slipped into her father's tent. With little time left to see him, she wanted to remember his face as much as possible. Did he know that the girl who missed her father, not the naive child, was here now?

"What brings you here?"

"Huh...?"

At Isaac's sudden words, Angel's heart sank.

"Dad! Can you see me? Dad!"

Isaac slowly raised his upper body, pulled out his staff, and pointed it at Angel.

"Huh...? Why...?"

But Isaac's focus was not on her but behind her. Turning around, she saw Professor Raiden standing there.

"I came to see if you've changed your mind."

"I told you, as long as I live, I will hunt you down and eradicate you. How long will you Dark Wizards pretend to be noble?"

Raiden met Isaac's gaze calmly.

"You will seek me out."

"That will never happen."

"If that time comes..."

He threw a black crystal at Isaac, who caught it with magic and, recognizing it, his expression turned grave.

"Swallow it."

Raiden turned into mist and disappeared again, leaving Isaac alone with the black crystal.

"That's... the essence of dark mana."

Flame, who had been watching quietly, spoke.

"It's not given to just anyone. Powerful wizards make contracts with even more powerful beings. That black crystal holds immense potential. If a great wizard possesses it, it could cause a disaster."

"No way... This is..."

The situation was unfolding just as she knew from history. The dark transformation of Isaac Morphe and his betrayal.

"No, it can't be. Father will discard it."

But as if to shatter her hopes, Isaac carefully put the crystal away. His expression was shadowed, as if bearing a heavy burden, but she couldn't understand it.

"This can't be happening..."

Unable to accept reality, Angel ran out of the tent. Flame looked at Isaac Morphe with a bitter expression. He was the father of the heroine and a great wizard with strong convictions. But something twisted at the end, leading to a tragic fate.

"Sigh... Is it time for Angel to learn the 'truth'?"

Flame sighed and left Isaac's tent. Angel, with her blue hair shining in the moonlight, looked up at the sky.

"I don't know anymore..."

"Yeah..."

"I want to go back. If I see more, I won't be able to bear it."

It was a reasonable thought, but Angel's resolve was firm.

"Now that it's come to this, I need to find out everything."

With a determined expression, she headed to another tent, that of Princess Hong Shihua. Ignoring the guards and magical barriers, they entered and saw Hong Shihua lying on the bed, groaning in pain.

"Ugh..."

"Please bear with it, Princess."

Hong Shihua, half-naked, was receiving an injection from a doctor, the red liquid looking ominous.

"It's done."

"Yes."

Sweating, Hong Shihua put on her top and bit her lip.

"The pain won't subside yet."

"I don't care about the pain. As long as I don't die."

She spoke, her words revealing her true purpose.

"I don't want to end up like my sister."

"Sister...?"

"Yes. Her name was probably Hong Erin."

"I've never heard of her."

"She died when we were young. I don't know the exact time, but it was around this time."

"Why..."

"Princess Hong Shihua, do you really believe you can find a way to break the Adolevit curse from Bai Yuhuo Hualing?"

The doctor asked quietly, and Hong Shihua frowned.

"I don't know. The possibility is about 0.01%."

"You caused such a big incident for such a slim chance?"

"Of course. Until now, it was zero. If there's even a 0.01% chance, it's worth trying."

That was her true purpose, unknown to other wizards. Despite opposing the Morphe Grand Duchy, Hong Shihua desperately sought something.

"Bai Yuhuo Hualing controls 'Living Flame.' If I can obtain it, I might escape this endless pain."

"Do you have the confidence to defeat the demonic beast?"

"Absolutely."

She closed her eyes tightly, unable to bear the pain any longer, but she didn't want to show weakness.

"With the Extreme Night Fire Curse of the first Adolevit, I can burn any flame."

This battle was already won in terms of compatibility. The first Adolevit had said, "I can extinguish any flame in the world with my flame." That legendary magic, passed down only to the Adolevit bloodline, required 30 wizards of Class 8 and 500 wizards of Class 6 or higher to prepare a massive magic formation. No matter how powerful Bai Yuhuo Hualing was, it couldn't withstand it.

"That princess must have her reasons too."

Flame, watching Hong Shihua, spoke with a complicated expression. But Angel's anger remained.

"Still, I can't forgive her..."

Even if she had reasons for unsealing Bai Yuhuo Hualing, why did she kill her father?

"You'll find out in due time."

The next day arrived.

Whoosh!

The white flames engulfed the red flames of the elite wizards. Angel and Flame lost all hope.

"Arrogant descendant of Adolevit..."

It was taller than a mountain, steeper than a cliff, bluer than the sky, and lighter than a cloud. A mysterious existence, like a divine beast. The giant white fox spoke to the kneeling Hong Shihua Adolevit.

"Did you think you could burn me with your flame? You were wrong. That flame was also created by me. The descendants of Adolevit are arrogant and foolish."

She had no idea. Her ancestor had said that his magic could extinguish any flame in the world. But it was all a lie?

"Ah..."

All the Class 8 wizards collapsed or died from mana backlash, the knights were all swept away by the flames, and less than 10% of the remaining forces survived. In contrast, Bai Yuhuo Hualing was unscathed. A perfect defeat in terms of compatibility.

"Now that I have awakened, I will cover the world with my flames as promised. Realize this, Adolevit."

What? Bai Yuhuo Hualing didn't finish the sentence, moving gracefully despite its massive size. The wizards had lost all will to fight, unable to stand.

Except for one.

"You cannot pass here..."

Isaac Morphe.

Despite being half-burned by the white flames, his eyes burned brighter than ever, as if he had made a decision.

"Dad..."

Angel reached out to her father, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't touch him.

"You are... a descendant of Morphe."

Bai Yuhuo seemed to smile.

"It reminds me of that time..."

"No, you're wrong. I am no longer a descendant of Morphe."

With difficulty, he raised his remaining arm and pulled out something from his pocket. The black crystal given by Professor Raiden. Isaac looked at it and closed his eyes tightly, biting his lip so hard his face turned red. He was crying.

"Angel..."

"Dad..."

Whispering names they couldn't reach, Isaac reached out to the air. Angel tried to place her hand on his but passed through.

"Please, don't do it. Dad, please."

"I..."

Angel's voice scattered into the void, and Isaac opened his bloodshot eyes, looking at Bai Yuhuo.

"From today, I will become a Dark Wizard."

That was the truth about her father that seventeen-year-old Angel Morphe had desperately wanted to know.
