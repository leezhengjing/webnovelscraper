### 39. Urban Legend (2)

The Cradle of the Celestial Spirit Tree, the White Castle. Elf King Huaseorin, who rarely used it and thus had little human scent, was looking at herself in the mirror in her bedroom. The black, thin fabric veil and dress covered her body so tightly that not a single bit of her skin was exposed, giving off a subtly different atmosphere from what she used to wear.

‘Although I can't do much for you... this much should be possible.’

In the space of the divine beast at the root of the Celestial Spirit Tree, Yan Hongchun Samwol had apologized to her and given her a special gift. The first gift was the weakening of the curse.

‘Even if there is no divine artifact for now... I will transfer part of your ability to Bai Yuseol using myself as a medium.’

In fact, Huaseorin did not fully understand her own abilities, except for the fact that she could forcibly charm others. However, according to Yan Hongchun Samwol, she possessed countless abilities. Huaseorin transferred a very small part of these abilities to Bai Yuseol, a process that took three days and nights, but the method was surprisingly simple and ordinary. They just had to sit down, hold hands, and resonate with each other's energy.

However, for Huaseorin, this was an incredibly special event. To hold hands with someone and feel their warmth. Although the time of three days and nights might seem tedious, when Huaseorin held Bai Yuseol's hand... she felt a thrilling emotion. It was a feeling she had never experienced before, and although she couldn't explain it, she thought it might be what people call 'happiness.'

Weakening the curse? It was something she had really hoped for and was a good gift. But... to her, this was an even greater gift that touched her heart deeply.

And the second gift. The curse-blocking dress.

‘I made it by referencing your dress. Until now, just breathing in the same space as you would have affected those around you with the curse, and even hearing your voice would have been dangerous. But if you wear this dress, you won't have to worry about that.’

The dress was far superior in performance to the one Huaseorin had handcrafted herself, allowing her to show her face to the outside world to some extent. Having lost her trusted aide, Huaseorin had to perform the king's duties herself and could no longer seclude herself in the forest, making this a truly necessary item.

She looked at herself in the mirror with calm eyes. Her appearance was no different from before. She still had to hide every part of herself, unable to show anyone.

Knock, knock, knock!

- May I come in?

At that moment, hearing someone's voice from outside, Huaseorin hurriedly nodded.

“Yes, come in.”

As the door opened, Bai Yuseol walked in, passing through the guards who protected the Elf King's bedroom.

Click!

As the door closed, he looked around the bedroom with curious eyes. He had expected something grand for the king's bedroom, but it was rather ordinary, leaving him slightly disappointed.

“Hmm... it suits you well.”

“Thank you.”

Huaseorin, who had been speaking with a soft smile, glanced at the door for a moment and then took off her mask. It was an action she hadn't taken before, deeming it dangerous, but she felt it was okay to show her face in front of Bai Yuseol.

But how could she not be happy? Even if she was Huaseorin, even if she was the Elf King, couldn't she fulfill a small... a little desire?

People wouldn't know. The joy that comes from someone looking at her true face and eyes, not her mask. How delightful it is to show her smile to someone.

Huaseorin smiled. It had been so long since she last smiled that it felt awkward, but even that awkwardness melted away, brightening the atmosphere.

“…It’s nice. Being able to take off the mask like this.”

“If we gather all the divine artifacts, you’ll be able to do this outside as well.”

“Yes...”

Huaseorin hesitated for a moment before speaking.

“That, the divine artifacts...”

“I’ll try to find them.”

If asked who was busier between a student and a king, the answer was obviously the king. Moreover, compared to Huaseorin, Bai Yuseol had a bit more freedom to move around outside.

“I hope I’m not burdening you too much... When I have time, I’ll definitely help you find them.”

“That would be nice.”

Huaseorin, who had returned from Stella, was actually scheduled to be extremely busy. She was already busy, and now with fewer hands to help, she would probably have no time to sleep, being swamped with work. Moreover, having not handled her duties for a long time, her efficiency would have significantly dropped. It was unreasonable for her to go out searching for the divine artifacts herself right now.

So Bai Yuseol planned to find the divine artifacts alone. Fortunately, the items Yan Hongchun Samwol had mentioned were not difficult to find, and all the information was stored in the binoculars. Moreover, this trip was not entirely meaningless. Completing the sudden event had given him considerable skill experience from the Constellation Project, and Yan Hongchun Samwol's blessing level had increased.

* Sense +38%
* Mental Strength +1 Star 27%

▼ Detailed Abilities

Compared to the last time when the level was 1, it had risen by 2 levels, significantly increasing the ability growth rate. The most important stat, mental strength, had particularly increased noticeably, which could cover Bai Yuseol's weakness in long-term battles to some extent.

▼ Detailed Abilities

* Psychometry: Consumes mental strength to read part of the memory of a specific object.
* Telepathy: Consumes mental strength to convey or receive intentions to/from others.
* Mentalist: Consumes mental strength to understand the mind through the target's actions and gestures.
* Mental Shield: Consumes mental strength to resist mental attacks.
* Charming: Instills trust in the target when making eye contact. Strengthens persuasive power and can open the hearts of others.

‘Even if the world turns its back on you, the spring-like heart of Yan Hongchun will not waver.’

Additionally, a new ability was added. It was Charming, a very useful ability in social aspects rather than combat, which could draw favor from the opponent. This ability was the essence of Huaseorin's power. Although it was far inferior to her ability to drain souls just by facing them, it was still quite impressive. Moreover, as he continued to gather the divine artifacts, he would inherit more of her abilities, which was something to look forward to.

Although the initial goal was not to cure Huaseorin's constitution for the sake of abilities... it was a good thing nonetheless.

“Well, I’ll be going now. I have a lot of work piled up...”

“Yes. Take care.”

Huaseorin made a slightly regretful expression but soon put on her mask and bowed her head. Although the short meeting was regrettable... it was time to return to their respective positions.

As Huaseorin went back to her duties, a few members of the royal guard escorted Bai Yuseol out. As he left the White Castle, he looked back several times with a sense of regret. Although she was not yet a woman, spending time with someone who could be called a beauty was still regrettable.

‘I should see her more before she becomes a man...’

The thought that such a beauty was destined to become a man in the future was deeply regrettable.

A rumor without legs travels a thousand miles. However, it gets embellished with unnecessary details. Rumors spread frighteningly fast, and in the process, they get so distorted that it becomes hard to find the original.

“There’s a lot of talk about the 7th Tower these days.”

Skalben Club Room. Jeremy Skalben moved the yellow chess piece resembling his hair. Although he had never properly studied Soul Chess, he was quite skilled, having even defeated a professional player once.

“Are you interested in it too, Your Highness?”

“Yes. I like hearing what my peers are talking about.”

His smile as he spoke was so pure and dazzling that it made one's heart skip a beat. However, most of the club members already knew why he was interested in such rumors.

‘It’s about Flame.’

The free-spirited but beautiful commoner girl, Flame. She had appeared like a comet, stirring up Stella Academy with her light magic, shaking the hearts of many male students, including Jeremy, the Crown Prince. As a result, his subordinates had to always prepare news about Flame and take care of it, which was quite a hassle.

“There are various versions of the urban legend. Which one would you like to hear? I can tell you all of them.”

“All of them. Tell me.”

“Of course.”

As soon as the news that Flame was interested in the urban legend reached them, they had prepared for this situation in advance. Recently... Jeremy had not been in a good mood, so they had to make a good impression in any way possible.

Just before the school competition started, Crown Prince Jeremy had called three students and ordered them to somehow eliminate Bai Yuseol. He despised Bai Yuseol intensely and had planned to express that hatred not directly but by quietly manipulating things from behind. However, since that plan had failed, where would Jeremy's unexpressed anger go? His subordinates had to bear it all.

Therefore, among the students from the Skalben Empire at the academy, Flame and Bai Yuseol were quite resented. Why did a commoner keep making the Crown Prince's mood fluctuate? It wasn't like they would suffer!

“Hmm. I see.”

The Crown Prince listened to the urban legend about the 7th Tower with great interest. Indeed, even if one listens out of mere curiosity at first, it’s inevitable to become intrigued after hearing everything.

“According to the rumor, the 7th Tower actually exists somewhere within the school?”

“Yes. They say that if you find it, you can obtain the ‘legendary artifact’ left behind by the founder mage.”

Of course... it was hard to believe. If such a legendary artifact existed, wouldn’t the capable professors of Stella have already found it? Even if it were true, could students really find it when the professors couldn’t? Moreover, the rumors about the artifact were so varied. Some said it was a potion that grants eternal youth, while others claimed it was a staff with the power to destroy mountains. There was nothing to confirm what was true, but Jeremy was quite satisfied. He now had a story to tell Flame.

* * *

Shinmool Studies is surprisingly unpopular yet popular. The reason is that Professor Raidin, who teaches Shinmool Studies and Philosophy, is quite handsome. History proves that classes taught by beautiful and handsome professors are unusually popular. Despite teaching the minor subjects of Shinmool Studies and Philosophy, Professor Raidin's classes were always full. Even during the summer vacation, Professor Raidin conducted seasonal classes, and they were still packed with students.

Angel Morf was also one of the students of Shinmool Studies. It wasn’t because Raidin was handsome. She had coincidentally taken the class due to Bai Yuseol and had genuinely become interested in the subject.

“Please sign the guestbook.”

While studying Shinmool Studies, Angel had some questions and decided to visit Professor Raidin's office in the 2nd Tower. Most professors looked kindly upon students who came with questions, but Angel was a bit of a special case, so some professors were not very pleased, making this process quite uncomfortable for her. Fortunately, Professor Raidin treated everyone equally, regardless of their background or status, which was a relief. So she felt at ease visiting Professor Raidin's office.

Knock, knock!

“Are you there...?”

She cautiously knocked on Professor Raidin's office door and took a deep breath. Entering the office was always a nerve-wracking experience. However, there was no response.

“Is he out...?”

But if the professor was out for a class or other reasons, the ‘Out’ sign would be lit. However, the ‘ON’ light was on, indicating that the professor was inside.

“Hmm... well, he might be busy.”

Thinking she would come back later, Angel turned to leave. But then...

Crash! Creak...

- You bastard! I was supposed to handle this project! How dare you proceed with it first!

A loud, angry voice echoed from inside the office. The door was slightly ajar, making the voice clearly audible.

‘That voice... Professor Chekiren?’

Professor Chekiren, who taught the subject with the long and complicated name "The Correlation Between Reality and Illusion," was known for his bad temper and poor character, making him quite unpopular among students. It seemed there was a conflict with Professor Raidin over a research project.

- Calm down. Your voice is leaking out.

- Huff! Is that important now? I’ve always said I would handle the 7th Tower! But you dared to proceed first...!

‘The 7th Tower?’

Hearing the mention of the 7th Tower, which had recently become a hot topic, Angel couldn't help but listen more intently.

- I conducted all the research! Only the last step remains, and you dare...!

- It’s the will of the higher-ups. Don’t defy it.

- You always use that excuse! Can you swear on mana that none of your personal intentions are involved?

- One does not swear on mana lightly.

- Of course, you wouldn’t! You...

Thud!

The conversation was abruptly cut off, followed by the sound of something falling to the floor. Then, silence. No more conversation could be heard, so Angel quickly tried to leave but felt a strange sense of unease, so she stepped back and composed herself, pretending she had just arrived at the office.

At that moment, the door swung open, and Professor Raidin appeared. It was perfect timing.

“...What brings you here?”

“Ah? Hello, Professor! I had some questions from the class earlier. But... I heard something fall just now. Am I interrupting?”

Angel asked with a bright, innocent look in her eyes. Her eyes were filled with pure curiosity, leaving no room for suspicion. Her traits [All-Rounder] and [Versatile] combined to create world-class acting skills, which she was now displaying.

“It’s nothing. I’m busy now, so please leave.”

“Um, okay...”

With a regretful expression, Angel turned and left, and Raidin closed the door with a thud and went back inside.

“Phew...”

She quickly left the 2nd Tower and walked briskly to a nearby garden, where she sat on a bench to calm her trembling legs. She then tried to organize her thoughts, which had turned white with shock.

‘What did I just hear?’

It was clear that she had overheard something unusual.
