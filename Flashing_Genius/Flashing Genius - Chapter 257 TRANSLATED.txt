# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy's Frontline

## Chapter 257: The Noble Soul (7)

**Ledetrix VI Black Thunderstorm No. 7**. This was the nickname of the airship frequently used by the president of the Magic Society, Aryumon Blushun. The cost of a single airship was astronomical, and the maintenance fees were so high that it seemed impossible for an individual to own one. However, this did not apply to the upper echelons. Aryumon did not particularly enjoy accumulating wealth, but he was quite serious about his airship collection.

*Vroom...!!* The loud noise of the mana engine, heavily tuned, echoed through the dock of the Third World Tree, Hwaran. *Whoosh!* Thanks to the elves who had already reported Aryumon's visit upon hearing the airship's signal, the elder of Hwaran, Suhaksan, was able to greet him in time.

"Hoho, Aryumon. It's been a while."

"Grandpa Suhaksan. You still look robust."

"Though it's nice to see you visit so suddenly, I must admit I'm more surprised than pleased."

"Ah, yes. I apologize for not giving prior notice."

Aryumon spoke with a weary expression and extended his hand for a handshake. Suhaksan's eyebrows twitched at this.

'Still an annoying fellow.'

A handshake was a typical human custom spread by humans. It was customary for the visitor to adapt to the culture of the elves, but Aryumon never respected the other party's culture. The Grand Mage Aryumon Blushun was a staunch believer in human superiority. Of course, there were valid reasons for his superiority complex. The highest proportion of existing 8th-class mages were humans, and historically, more than half of the mages who reached the divine realm of the 9th class were also humans. The progenitor mage was also presumed to be human. Moreover, Aryumon himself was one of the fewer than ten 9th-class mages on the continent, so Suhaksan had no choice but to accept the handshake.

"What brings you here?"

However, if Aryumon had come after hearing about the contamination of the World Tree, Suhaksan had no intention of seeking his cooperation. No human could be involved in matters related to the sacred World Tree. Fortunately, Aryumon seemed to have come for a different purpose. He handed Suhaksan a document titled 'Request for Cooperation in the Search for Black Mage.'

"Hmm!"

Seeing the unexpected request for cooperation, Suhaksan fell silent. Showing such a document in a public place like this was akin to openly saying, 'It seems there are black mages here, so we will search your area.' If there was clear evidence, the Magic Department would have absolute power in the search for black mages, making refusal impossible. This was a clause that all races had agreed to, so even the elder of Hwaran could not refuse... but it was a matter of degree. Stirring the sacred World Tree to catch a mere fly was unacceptable.

"I will review it carefully."

Suhaksan slowly read through the document. Before long, his eyes widened in shock.

"Is this... really true?"

"Yes. We are well aware of how rude this is. But please, we need your cooperation. The situation is quite troublesome right now."

The black mage Cherliban. The legendary black mage who had caused tens of thousands of casualties before disappearing decades ago had suddenly appeared here. 'No, it's not certain yet. It's just circumstantial evidence. But...!' If the contents of the document were true, Cherliban was highly likely to have headed to Hwaran's orchard. By now, he might already be hiding somewhere here. This was more dangerous than expected. It was not a matter to refuse out of pride.

"Can we move to a different place to talk?"

Suhaksan spoke in a heavy voice, and Aryumon readily nodded. In a situation where time was of the essence, it was fortunate that the conversation was going smoothly.

* * *

It was quiet. The cool glass shards floated in the air, pricking my skin. I sat cross-legged in front of Yiphanell, closed my eyes, and took deep breaths. To be precise, I was delicately operating the 'Tae Ryung Mind Technique.' I had long discarded the gas mask. If you ask if it was dangerous, I could say it was definitely dangerous. It might have shortened my lifespan, and I might collapse soon. But there was a reason I had to go this far. The binoculars were not omnipotent. When attempting something new, 'I' had to come into contact with it. Until now, I could analyze magic just by looking at it because the source of magic was 'magic circles' and 'runes.' They could be interpreted just by looking. However, some advanced magic required not only observation but also magical contact for analysis. The high-density mana scattered in Yiphanell's garden was of that kind. It was impossible to analyze just by looking with the gas mask on. It was dangerous to breathe it directly, but...

'With the Tae Ryung Mind Technique, it's possible.'

I absorbed mana into my body and released it again. If I could use my body like a waterwheel to prevent the toxic mana from dissolving into my body, I could breathe it in. "Hoo..." The Tae Ryung Mind Technique required at least several tens of seconds to activate, and if I tried to use it while moving, it could take minutes. Was it easy to maintain? No, it wasn't. It required such a high level of concentration that the technique would break if I had any distracting thoughts. This had somewhat eased after receiving the blessing of Yeon Hong Chun Sam Wol. In the previous battle with the witch, the Tae Ryung Mind Technique never broke even while fighting frantically. But...

'What is this feeling?'

It wasn't just easy to maintain. Come to think of it, had I ever seriously trained the Tae Ryung Mind Technique after receiving the blessing of Yeon Hong Chun Sam Wol? Of course, I had been training consistently, but it was just repetitive daily training, not research for improvement. But today, as I desperately squeezed out the Tae Ryung Mind Technique to control the dense mana, I began to feel something. Even with my eyes closed, I could almost see the flow of mana, and I could mix a bit of my will into it. Before I knew it, I had stood up. I reached out into the air. Where did I put my sword? I couldn't remember, so I just mimicked holding a sword with my bare hands. I had no special swordsmanship. Just simple slashing, stabbing, and striking. My only swordsmanship. But that alone couldn't deal with a mage. The distant past Ha Tae Ryung, who taught me the mind technique, said so.

'The essence of magic combat is distance control.'

The essence of magic combat was to move out of the range of magic and then re-enter to strike a vital point. I had no swordsmanship, but I had tactics. In the past, Ha Tae Ryung practiced footwork to the extreme to implement the above method. But how fast could an ordinary human's footwork be? It was much slower than the leap used by knight-type mages and had less instantaneous power than a power jump. Ha Tae Ryung had to overcome this through constant combat and experience, but... I didn't have to. I had a unique magic that no other mage possessed.

'If I can activate the Tae Ryung Mind Technique at will.'

Until now, the preparation time was too long, so I was at a disadvantage at the start of the battle. But if I could freely enter the mental world with the help of Yeon Hong Chun Sam Wol, it wouldn't be impossible. 'Maybe... I can always maintain the Tae Ryung Mind Technique.' If I could imprint the Tae Ryung Mind Technique in a corner of my mind and make it my normal breathing, I could freely move in a space filled with toxic mana... and perhaps even achieve the 'eternal life' that Ha Tae Ryung dreamed of. Of course, I didn't particularly want to live long, but...

'Ugh!'

Was it because I had concentrated too much? I passed through the mental world and fell into a deeper, more distant mental world. It was like falling into the deep sea at midnight, where I couldn't see anything and couldn't tell directions.

'This is... dangerous.'

If I fell any further, I felt like I would never be able to return. I swam desperately towards the surface.

'I have to wake up.'

With that single thought, I frantically moved towards the sky. Suddenly, someone grabbed my collar. It wasn't a strong grip. It was a weak touch that I could shake off. But something bothered me, so I looked down into the deep sea of the mental world. '...Yiphanell?' There was a spirit in the form of a young girl. She opened her lips with an ambiguous expression, but I couldn't hear her voice. But before that, a question arose. 'Why is Yiphanell here?' Wasn't this my mental world? Then I realized that she and I were connected by our souls. 'Here... I can ask why Yiphanell became like this.' I grabbed her shoulders and shouted.

'Yiphanell! Answer me! Who did this to you?'

But she tilted her head and moved her lips as if she couldn't hear me. I couldn't hear her. 'Damn. Do I have to go further down?' I quickly dismissed the thought. Yiphanell must have come up from somewhere deep in the sea, and if I went down any further, I might lose my way back. 'That...' At the end of the endless sea, a small purple butterfly-like thing flickered. That was... Yiphanell's mental world. If I swam towards that butterfly, I could enter her mind. '...I can't do that.' I slowly let go of Yiphanell's hand. I wanted to take her out right away, but it was too dangerous to forcefully wake her up while she was corrupted by black magic. 'I'll come to get you soon.' I mouthed the words to Yiphanell, and she seemed to understand as she smiled faintly, a rare sight. Then she fell into the deep sea, waving her hand like an innocent child saying goodbye, which bothered me. *Bubble bubble!* I forced myself out of the deep sea of the mental world, surfaced, and opened my eyes, regaining consciousness.

"Hoo..."

My whole body felt refreshed. Normally, my leg muscles would be numb after sitting cross-legged for a long time, but I felt as refreshed as if I had just woken up. [Analysis complete] [Reporting the results.] Just as I was about to read the analysis results from the binoculars, another message caught my eye.

"Huh?"

It wasn't from the binoculars, but a system message purely assigned to me. Notifications were pouring in.

[Skill 'Mana Leakage Delay' level up!] [Overall stats significantly increased.] [You can handle strength more delicately, your body becomes more agile, and your mind becomes clearer.] [Your vision becomes clearer, allowing you to see objects more vividly.] [Your senses become sharper, allowing you to feel things you couldn't before.]

I was bewildered by the type of message I had never seen before.

"What on earth is going on...?"

It seemed that I had not been utilizing even 1% of the blessing of the Twelve Gods until now.
