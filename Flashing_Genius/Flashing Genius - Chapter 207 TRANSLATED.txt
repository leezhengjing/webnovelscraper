# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 207

## 46. An Old Story (3)

Who would have thought things would turn out this way? Just the fact that Jelliel showed tears made it very easy to understand what was happening now. The [Villainess Jelliel's Redemption] route, which only a very small number of gamers who played Aether World Online could see. There was a reason why only a very few players could see it. It required quite high difficulty conditions to reach that point.

The first condition: Raise Jelliel's favorability to the extent that you can interact with her. The second condition: Help Jelliel find the ancient ruins of Carmenset. The third condition: Have Jelliel win a game of Soul Chess against Carmenset. 

At first glance, these conditions seemed easy, but ordinary players would be blocked from the first condition. Approaching Jelliel, who was not easy to talk to, raising her favorability, and even becoming close enough to interact with her was a daunting task. Players who reached this stage were considered veterans in the community.

The second condition was relatively easy. It was just a matter of following the strategies posted by veteran players to find the keywords leading to the ancient ruins of Carmenset. However, the third condition was... practically impossible. The NPCs in the game surprisingly had their own artificial intelligence, with learning abilities, and could be taught Soul Chess. But how often would one get the chance to play chess with Jelliel? Even if one could, they would need to be skilled enough to teach her, which was a very arduous journey.

I, too, ultimately failed.

"…Father has disappeared?"

In the abandoned station where the rain was pouring, I sat side by side on a half-broken chair, listening to Jelliel's story.

"It's my fault…."

She blamed herself, but if you think about it, it was more my fault. I was the one who taught Jelliel Soul Chess, hoping she would win against Carmenset. I never thought she would actually win...

By now, the Magic Tower would be in an uproar trying to find Melian. Who knows what benefits might come from rescuing the body of the Starcloud Chairman. But unfortunately, I can confidently say that all of that is in vain. Knowing that this would happen if Jelliel won against Carmenset, would I have irresponsibly led to this situation?

Fortunately, Melian will be able to return to his original form. Probably, with a 100% probability. Even now, if I set my mind to it, I can do it, but I have to act as a heartless person here. To rehabilitate Jelliel. I can't save her father without any conditions. I plan to impose restrictions on Jelliel again this time.

In the world of Aether World Online, there are many villains, but there are two main villainesses who are closest to the protagonist and antagonize her. Hong Biyeon, who holds the greatest power, and Jelliel, who controls the world's finances. They were formidable opponents for the commoner girl protagonist to face, but the benefits of rehabilitating them were also enormous. The reason doesn't need much explanation.

Especially when Jelliel is rehabilitated, the world undergoes a tremendous change. Jelliel, who had lived solely for her own benefit, would donate her enormous financial resources for the development of the world to atone for her past misdeeds. Of course, just because she atones with finances doesn't mean the countless annoying episodes she caused for the protagonist disappear, so she had quite a few anti-fans despite her pretty appearance.

…Honestly, I didn't like Jelliel that much either.

"I'll take responsibility and find your father."

"…Really? Can you really find him?"

She asked in a voice that found it hard to believe, even though she was the one who asked for help first. 

"Yes, it's possible. By the way, I have one question."

Jelliel looked at me with blank eyes. She still seemed not fully herself.

"How did you find me? Why did you come to me?"

I was curious why she came to me in the first place. By now, the 9th-class Archmage Haeseongwol would be helping her. Wouldn't he be more reliable than me?

She hesitated a bit and then slowly moved her lips.

"A fortune teller… came to me and told me. That if I came here, there would be someone who could help me."

"…Wait, a fortune teller? A fortune teller?"

Could it be that the fortune teller is the one I know? Eunse Shibilwol once said. Someone who recently met me and has goodwill towards me is a divine object. Many candidates came to mind, but the most suspicious person I recently met was the mysterious fortune teller I encountered on the train.

I hurriedly took out the poster I had hidden in my pocket and showed it to her.

"Does he look like this?"

〈Looking for a fortune teller who looks like this〉
* Characteristics: Quack

Jelliel looked at my drawing and scrunched her face with a look of disbelief.

"Your drawing… is terrible…"

"No? It's well-drawn."

"No, it's not."

"It's well-drawn."

This friend doesn't understand art. Well, it might be a bit much to expect a modern person to understand my drawing. My drawing is about a thousand years ahead of its time. It's truly heartbreaking that there are no talents who can recognize my drawing yet.

Jelliel frowned and stared at my drawing for a long time before nodding.

"This person… seems right."

"Really?"

"Where is he now?"

When I asked urgently, Jelliel widened her eyes in surprise.

"I don't know…."

She said she just met him by chance, but honestly, I can't believe it.

"By chance."

If my guess is correct, that fortune teller is undoubtedly Eunse Shibilwol's divine object. Such a being would never create such a meeting by chance. Especially since it was said to have the ability to govern the 'future.' In terms of purely peeking into the future, it was said to be even better than Eunse Shibilwol himself.

'How many abilities has this old man split up…'

Well, it makes sense. When you get close to Eunse Shibilwol in the original game, he would sometimes confide his inner thoughts, and his troubles were revealed.

'Seeing the past, present, and future simultaneously is not a happy thing. Imagine knowing when the beautiful relationships you have now will end.'

Imagine having someone you love, but the sight of her death haunts you for the rest of your life. That is… not a blessing but a curse.

"Well, then."

I stood up and tilted the umbrella towards Jelliel. According to the forecast from the Magic Tower, the rainy season front had arrived, so this rain would not stop for a while. By now, the Full Moon Tower Master Haeseongwol would be helping Jelliel. Perfect timing. Normally, I wouldn't even be able to talk to the great Archmage, but now I can use him.

Lotus Inn.

…About a thousand miles away from there, on a watchtower built on a cloud. This place, which served as the model for the famous painting 'Immortal's Game,' where immortals gathered to play Go, was almost developed into a tourist spot in modern times but was canceled. Now, it was a place where no human foot could reach. All the immortals had left, and ordinary humans could not find this place.

Thud!

There, Eunse Shibilwol was playing Go alone. Although it was an open place where anyone could come, no one visited, so it was solely his sanctuary.

"…What brings you here?"

With his eyes fixed on the Go board, Shinyue spoke, and a woman appeared as the clouds behind him parted. Holding an old bag in one hand and a bundle of cards hanging from her waist, adorned with what seemed to be cheap accessories, her name was… none. Because Eunse Shibilwol had not given her a name. If there was a word used in current society, it would be 'fortune teller.'

She gently lowered her thick, cheap sunglasses and smiled, revealing her crooked teeth.

"Old man, I wondered what you were doing these days, and here you are, living in such a place?"

"Time is precious, but one cannot live every moment busily."

"Have you ever lived busily? Well, I don't remember that."

"What brings you here?"

Thud!

The old man placed the last Go stone. The white and black stones on the board were perfectly symmetrical, but strangely, the white stones were one house ahead.

"I came because I was bored. Is there a reason for an aunt's journey?"

The fortune teller sat across from Shinyue, swept all the stones aside, and picked up a black stone.

"So, old man, give me a handicap."

Thud!

As the fortune teller placed the stone, Eunse Shibilwol picked up a white stone with a clattering sound. However, he spoke without placing the stone.

"You're still doing useless things."

The fortune teller, who had been talking non-stop, did not answer this question.

"Stop it."

"Well~ that's difficult. From the moment you gave me this power, it became my destiny."

Eunse Shibilwol had eyes that could see the future. The fortune teller inherited that ability even more vividly, allowing her to see the future more clearly. Naturally, she also knew that the world would be destroyed in ten years. So… the fortune teller was struggling to change the future. She had been working behind the scenes, finding countless variables and guiding them in the right direction to make the world a better place.

But.

"So, have you changed anything?"

The fortune teller still didn't know. That Eunse Shibilwol had also been making countless efforts. In the days when he had the complete power of time without sharing it with the divine objects, he had tried to rewind the world hundreds of times to lead it in a different direction and failed. All that remained for him was the despair of not being able to save the world.

'As the price for mastering the power of time, I cannot interfere with the events of the world.'

Because of this curse that came with the blessing, he could do nothing.

"Well… I've been making small changes."

For example, she had orchestrated the meeting between Jelliel and Baek Yuseol. Those two were destined to meet and help each other anyway. But if that meeting was too late, bad things could happen, so she made them meet a little earlier to prevent such 'probabilities.' Since they were destined to meet anyway, meeting a little earlier wouldn't change the future.

"Baek Yuseol. You are also interested in that child."

"Yes, that's right. That child's image kept appearing in the future I was looking at."

"I see."

Eunse Shibilwol couldn't see it. His current ability was so weakened that he could only probabilistically calculate the events happening right in front of him.

"That child is special."

He had tried that before. What if the power to turn back time was given to someone other than himself… What would happen then? He could turn back time but couldn't interfere with it. So he tried to have someone else turn back time and change the future. The result? It was a disastrous failure. Some lost their purpose and wandered for the rest of their lives, knowing only that they had returned in time. Some lost all their memories and lived like wrecks, and some didn't even realize they had returned in time. The toll for an ordinary being to reverse time was… 'memories.' Time took away their happiest memories as the price. For humans who live relying solely on memories, it was a cruel price.

Since that day, Eunse Shibilwol had completely given up on the plan to have someone else turn back time and prevent the future's destruction. He had been living day by day, waiting for the end, playing games. Then, one day, Baek Yuseol came.

"That child changed the future."

Eunse Shibilwol said as he placed a white stone. It was in a completely unexpected position.

"Although it was a very trivial future… it showed me the possibility."

He looked up and met the fortune teller's eyes directly, speaking in a heavy voice.

"I am now going to reclaim your powers."

The divine objects' consciousness was created by Eunse Shibilwol's power. Taking back that power meant he would die. But… even with that deadly statement, the fortune teller smiled, showing her ugly teeth. As if she had let go of all regrets. She smiled like that.

"Old man, your tongue is very long for the last game. Are you scared of losing?"

"…You wretched woman."

Thud!

The fortune teller placed a black stone on the Go board. Her hand movements seemed light, as if she had no regrets. Thus, the final game of Go between the two people who could see the future began.
