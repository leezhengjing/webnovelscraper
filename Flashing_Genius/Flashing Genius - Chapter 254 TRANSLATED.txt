# The Genius Who Became a Blink Mage at the Magic School

## Chapter 254: The Noble Soul (7)

The orchard of Namuhwaran was originally a tourist attraction, and although it was the off-season after the holiday season, it was still a bustling place due to its location in a major city. However, the visitors had no idea. They had come to the third World Tree to enjoy a leisurely time, never expecting to meet the ruler of all spirits, divine beasts, fairies, and elvesâ€”the Elf King, Ggotseorin.

Namuhwaran, Central Plaza. Although it wasn't the highest place in the orchard, it was a flat basin that allowed visitors to overlook the surrounding scenery, making it the most frequented spot. Today, it was even more crowded than usual.

"What's going on?"

"Is there some kind of event?"

"Shh, it's not an event! They say the Elf King is here in person!"

"Really? But why would someone who never shows themselves suddenly appear?"

To the general public, the Elf King Ggotseorin was a mysterious figure shrouded in secrecy. Rumor had it that she was so beautiful that anyone who saw her face would fall for her instantly, which is why she hid her appearance. However, since she never revealed herself, there was no way to know the truth.

Today, she suddenly appeared in the orchard of the third World Tree, Namuhwaran. She summoned an altar, used only for special ceremonies by the elves, to the central plaza and stood alone on it. Although she was still wrapped in a black dress and wore a white mask, making it impossible to see her appearance, people felt an unusual emotion. Despite being fully covered, why did the Elf King seem so beautiful?

No one knew that it was due to her latent ability, [Charming Presence].

"Hoo..."

Ggotseorin let out a small sigh and steadied her trembling voice. Thanks to the curse being significantly weakened, she could reveal herself as long as her face was covered. However, having lived in hiding for so long, being the center of attention was still quite burdensome.

But she had to do it. Without directly speaking to the World Tree, she couldn't find the cause of the black magic erosion.

As the leaves of the World Tree rustled and a green aurora began to slowly cover the sky, the murmuring crowd fell silent and looked up in awe.

"Wow..."

The people who had come to Namuhwaran to enjoy the natural scenery felt their hearts healed by the even more beautiful sight. However, unlike the onlookers, Ggotseorin frowned and bit her lip.

"It hurts. Go back. Sorry. It's painful."

The voice of a child echoed in her mind. It was undoubtedly the cry of Namuhwaran, but Ggotseorin couldn't even properly communicate with him. Namuhwaran couldn't maintain his sanity, making communication impossible.

"Ugh...!"

She bit her lip hard enough to draw blood and tried to focus her mind, but Namuhwaran's constant screams made it impossible for her to do anything.

"Please, get a hold of yourself! You need to tell me where it hurts...!"

Clang!

"Ugh!"

She barely managed to convey her will, but at that moment, Namuhwaran rejected Ggotseorin's consciousness. Unable to endure the extreme pain, he completely shut down his mental faculties.

Thud!

As Ggotseorin collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath, knights quickly ascended the altar to support her.

"Your Majesty, are you alright?"

"Ah..."

Unable to even respond, she looked up at the slowly fading green aurora. It was proof that the World Tree was struggling and refusing to communicate.

"It's beautiful..."

"Wow!"

But to the people, even that sight seemed beautiful, which made Ggotseorin's heart ache even more. She clenched her fists and lowered her head. If she could get an answer from the World Tree, she could somehow heal it, but she couldn't even do that.

"Your Majesty..."

"I'll have to find and treat it myself."

She had no intention of staying still. Staggering to her feet, Ggotseorin descended the altar and spoke.

"Summon the knights and order them to find the cause of the root contamination. I will search separately."

"Understood."

As soon as Ggotseorin's command was given, the knights gestured, and the waiting knights dispersed in all directions to lead their respective squads.

The World Tree was vast, grand, and complex. It was impossible to estimate how long it would take to search the entire tree, but if she extended her senses to the fullest, she might manage somehow.

"First..."

Ggotseorin planned to start from the highest point of the World Tree and slowly search downward. As she descended the altar, she met the eyes of Baek Yuseol, who was waiting for her.

Then she remembered that she had promised to meet with Yiphanel along with him and smiled bitterly. She had been looking forward to spending time together. But now, she had to save the World Tree first.

"I'm sorry. Could you wait a moment? I'll solve this quickly."

"No, let's move together."

"You don't have to because of me..."

"It's not because of that. I think I've found the cause."

"What?"

It was hard to believe that he had already found the cause when nothing had been done since the incident began. Ggotseorin widened her eyes in disbelief, and Baek Yuseol gestured behind him.

"If you insist, shall we go together? To Yiphanel's garden."

If Baek Yuseol's guess was correct, there would be a barrier there by now. It would be impossible to enter alone. At least in the second semester of the second year or the beginning of the third year, he would have had the items and abilities to break the barrier, but now he was too weak.

"Rather... it's fortunate that Ggotseorin is here."

In the original episode, the protagonist had to solve it alone, making it excessively difficult. But now, with Ggotseorin, who had the power equivalent to a 9th-class mage, there was nothing to fear.

"However, if there's one thing to worry about... it's the 'Spirit Slayer' appearing in front of Yiphanel. Only a handful of players had faced the Spirit Slayer, and it was one of the worst episodes.

"Just in case, I need to be careful."

Since the unexpected always happened, it wouldn't hurt to be cautious this time as well. With that thought, Baek Yuseol led Ggotseorin to Yiphanel's garden, hoping that the erosion hadn't progressed too severely.

Among the students of Stella Academy, a significant proportion were nobles. The children of noble families often had to miss classes due to family events, and if there was a valid reason, they could receive up to four days of attendance credit. This meant they could miss an entire week of classes.

Of course, it was rare for students to receive the maximum four-day leave, as large-scale events were uncommon among noble families. But who was Hong Biyeon? She was a princess of the Adolevit royal family. She confidently took a four-day leave, including the weekend, and left Arcanium on the royal family's private airship.

Looking at the clouds floating outside the window, she pondered.

"Father has approved. As a member of the royal family, the princess has the right to participate in the purification ceremony."

The purification ceremony in Morfran Forest would be a critical weakness for Hong Siwha. Hong Biyeon's interference would undoubtedly create a disadvantageous situation, yet Duke Orkan accepted it too easily. Was there another scheme?

Hong Biyeon glanced at Sa Yeran Orkan, who was seated far from her. The girl with black eyes, whose thoughts were always unreadable. Although she was only two years older than Hong Biyeon, she was skilled at hiding her emotions, eloquent, and politically savvy. In terms of pure magic, she didn't feel too distant, but as a person, there was much to learn from her.

But that was all. Sa Yeran was an enemy, someone she would have to confront eventually.

"To become the queen... I must learn even from my enemies."

She recalled a saying she had read in a book. If there is something to learn, one should bow even to a beggar. Who said that? It was Isaac... Morfran... Hmm."

Then she suddenly remembered the annoyingly serene and peaceful face of Eizel and shook her head to dispel it.

"Princess, would you like some dessert?"

A royal attendant asked her, but she shook her head without answering. Dessert? She couldn't taste anything anyway.

"No, bring me cake and sweet cocoa."

Recently, she had realized that if she focused her senses on her tongue, she could faintly perceive 'taste.' It was very faint, and by normal standards, it could be dismissed as just a sensation of something touching the tongue, but she was certain. Her sense of taste was gradually returning to normal.

Since losing her sense of taste, she had been desperate to experience it again. She had tried countless methods to regain that happy sensation on her tongue, and this might be the result.

"I've brought it."

When the attendant placed the sweet chocolate cake and cocoa in front of her, she stabbed the cake with a fork and brought it to her lips. She wondered why she was so nervous about something so trivial. She put the cake in her mouth and carefully focused on tasting it.

"I can't tell."

But she couldn't taste anything. Instead, the slimy and repulsive texture made her feel nauseous. Her sense of taste was not completely lost but twisted, and the repulsive texture dominated her mouth.

"Ugh..."

She rushed to the bathroom to spit out the cake and wiped the cold sweat from her forehead.

"Damn it..."

Without the ability to taste, she should avoid stimulating foods like cake. She had been too bold in her attempt, thinking she could taste it again.

"Why this time..."

She had felt the taste before. What was different then? She suddenly remembered who she had been dining with when she last tasted something. And then she let out a hollow laugh. The idea that her sense of taste changed depending on her dining companion was absurd.

"That doesn't make sense."

She tried to shake off the thought. It was ridiculous to think such trivial thoughts. Recently, she felt like she had changed so much that she found herself strange.

"Princess, are you alright?"

"Yes, I'm coming out."

When she left the bathroom, Sa Yeran was waiting with her usual indifferent gaze. Hong Biyeon tried to act nonchalant and returned to her seat, and Sa Yeran watched her for a moment.

"Taste..."

A thought crossed Sa Yeran's mind, but she didn't voice it. Hong Biyeon was an enemy, and there was no need to help her.
