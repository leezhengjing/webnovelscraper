### School Competition (3)

The school competition was held in a different location every year. Two years ago, it was at Kaikaren Private Magic School, the year before last at Starflower Magic School, and last year at Molondo Magic School. This year's school competition is being held at Stella Academy. As a result, the students of Stella were extremely busy preparing for the event. Naturally, they were not working for free. The students who helped prepare for the competition were given considerable compensation and benefits, so it was known as a "sweet part-time job" among the students of Stella. Many commoners stayed behind during the summer vacation to work.

Of course, there were those who continued with their own tasks, regardless of such events.

Boom!

"I brought it."

Stella Magic Library. Flame placed a pile of thick books on the table. Despite her small frame, her strength was surprising. However, the other two girls didn't seem to care and each took a book to read.

The 'Twelve Divine Moons.' The existence that Angel, Hong Biyeon, and Flame were investigating was the legendary Twelve Divine Moons. After suddenly falling asleep a thousand years ago, they now only existed in the form of faith, and were speculated to be the key to the world's destruction.

The twelve lights shown in the Star Library were undoubtedly the remnants left by the Twelve Divine Moons. The girls decided to share the information and events they knew with each other.

Flame spoke first.

"...If Baek Yuseol really returned with the power of the 'Silver Eleven Moons,' he wouldn't be able to tell us."

"Why is that?"

"It's similar to being stopped when trying to tell others about the knowledge seen in the Star Library. The moment he reveals future events, he could be erased by the prohibition of 'Heaven's Secret.'"

No one questioned how Flame knew this. It was out of respect for each other.

"So, it's impossible to talk directly with Baek Yuseol about this."

"That's right. That man... can't answer anything. He might even avoid us if he realizes we know the secret. If the knowledge of the future leaks to us..."

Angel, who had experienced it vividly, turned pale.

"...Principal Elteman, who used magic to hear the secrets of the Star Library, collapsed coughing up blood. It was definitely not the right choice."

"To think it was that severe... Even Elteman Eltewin, who is called the strongest in the world, couldn't withstand it."

The girls' faces darkened.

Next was Hong Biyeon.

"Do you remember the last day of the Familiar Contract Ceremony?"

"Of course."

"We almost died..."

"At that time, I saw something quite strange. While Baek Yuseol was unconscious after defeating Professor Maizen... one of the Twelve Divine Moons, 'Yeon Hongchun Samwol,' was hugging that commoner."

"What, what did you say?"

"The Twelve Divine Moons... appeared directly?"

This was quite a shocking story, and Flame and Angel's eyes widened.

"Yes. It was definitely Yeon Hongchun Samwol. I didn't know much about that existence, but strangely, I knew the moment I saw it. That was the Twelve Divine Moons. The existence that governs the power of the mind..."

Why was such an existence hugging Baek Yuseol? What kind of relationship did he have with Yeon Hongchun Samwol?

...If that's the case, is Baek Yuseol really traveling the world to gather the Twelve Divine Moons?

"Come to think of it... he always went out every weekend."

"So, while handling school schedules, he was traveling the world on weekends."

It was truly amazing stamina. Or maybe, because he was handling such a tough schedule, he was dozing off during class?

"That's true. With his level of knowledge... there's no reason for him to attend the academy."

"Indeed. If he needs to gather the Twelve Divine Moons, why maintain school life?"

"There must be a reason he found through countless experiences that he has to attend school."

Baek Yuseol. His school life was both special and ordinary. He stood out for not using magic, but his grades were always average. In other words, he wasn't attending school for grades.

"Then, the only thing left is... human relationships."

If he intended to solve everything with his own power in this life, he would have dropped out of school long ago and wandered the world to gather his strength. But that method was not right. The best choice to prevent the world's destruction was at Stella Academy.

The people he was most interested in after enrolling were...

"...Us, right?"

At Flame's hollow voice, Angel and Hong Biyeon pressed their lips together. It wasn't wrong. Right after enrolling, Baek Yuseol was particularly concerned about the three people present here.

Is that so... Flame, who knew the existence of the original novel, could somewhat understand. She was a transmigrator, Angel was the protagonist of the original, and Hong Biyeon was the top rival with talent equal to the protagonist. 

Moreover, considering that he also paid attention to various students including Mayuseong, he might have found some potential in Stella's students.

But the other two girls looked a bit puzzled.

"Why me?"

They still couldn't grasp how great a destiny awaited them as future grand magicians.

Still...

The fact that Baek Yuseol had been subtly paying attention to them from the beginning was quite pleasing, and a subtle smile appeared on the girls' faces.

---

The highest peak of the Primordial Mountain Range. An unnamed ancient castle. The aide Orenha came here alone to meet their king, Flowerseorin, who ruled over all fairies and elves. After passing through the minimal guard protecting the castle, he knelt at the top, and Flowerseorin made her presence known.

"...You have come, Orenha."

"Yes, Your Majesty."

Her voice was slightly hoarse. It had been a long time since she last spoke. Her voice contained a charm that could captivate those around her, so she had no choice but to refrain from speaking. She seemed quite pleased to see the only person she could talk to freely, as her footsteps approached the door. However, the door did not open. Although Orenha had immunity to curses to some extent, prolonged exposure was unpredictable.

...Of course. The claim that Orenha had 'curse immunity' was a blatant lie. He had long been captivated by Flowerseorin's magic, but he hid that fact thoroughly. Lovesickness? That was a disease for the weak-willed. If one had someone they loved, they should hone their abilities and make a thorough plan to win that person over, not suffer alone and die.

Orenha hid all his emotions thoroughly. How many times had he wanted to rush in and confess his love when facing her? If he didn't have the trait [Steel Will], he might have ended up like the others.

"What brings you here?"

Hearing Flowerseorin's excited voice made his heart pound. He spoke as calmly and emotionlessly as possible.

"The school competition starts next week. You don't need to be directly involved, but an invitation has arrived."

"...I see. I cannot go. It's not an important matter, and there's no need for the Elf King to appear at a mere school competition. Even without the curse."

However, it was common for kings or high-ranking nobles to attend since prestigious schools from over thirty places participated. It wasn't strange for the Elf King to attend. Elteman Eltewin, who had power greater than most kings, would be watching the competition, and meeting him was a significant political reason.

"I wish to have Your Majesty attend this year's school competition."

"...Is that so?"

When Orenha spoke so firmly, there was always a reason. As Flowerseorin's most trusted aide, she didn't scold him but asked for the reason.

"Why?"

"I mentioned before that I found traces of the 'Spirit Slayer' Your Majesty was looking for."

At the mention of the most sensitive term for Flowerseorin, the atmosphere turned slightly cold. The temperature dropped due to the king's power. However, Orenha continued confidently.

"I believe I have found solid evidence."

The school competition is being held at Stella Academy. And... Baek Yuseol is attending there. Orenha had secretly investigated him thoroughly. He even captured a dark mage to interrogate about Baek Yuseol's identity. The conclusion was clear.

"Baek Yuseol is not an ordinary student."

"Baek Yuseol has a certain backing."

He was attending school for an extraordinary reason. It was amazing that a human maintained the appearance of a young boy without being a 9th-class grand magician, but that was it.

"Hiding dark magic and a corrupted soul... it's not impossible to hide his appearance."

He had recently met people with the technology to change appearances.

"The Tower of the Waning Moon."

They operated quietly behind the scenes with overwhelming magical technology, making it possible. The important thing was that appearance transformation was possible. Baek Yuseol was undoubtedly using such advanced magic technology to hide his true identity while attending Stella.

This wasn't just his own speculation. He had gathered information from numerous dark mage groups who showed a keen interest in Baek Yuseol, absorbed all their information, and investigated his actions thoroughly.

"You can't fool me."

Orenha, considered the greatest high elf in history, still remembered the clear spirit energy he felt from Baek Yuseol. The 'Soul Orb' he carried had been with him for a month. He could reveal Baek Yuseol's true identity.

This school competition, where the best elite students from around the world gathered, was a very special event. Revealing the truth about Baek Yuseol, who would attract everyone's attention, would not only captivate Flowerseorin but also bring significant political, diplomatic, and image benefits.

"...Is that so..."

Flowerseorin, who hadn't revealed the culprit yet, accepted Orenha's somewhat vague explanation with a trembling voice.

"Please... take care of it..."

After saying that, Flowerseorin's voice faded. She was going to spend time alone again to calm her mind. It was pitiful that she had to be alone, but it wasn't the right time yet.

"Soon, you will let me into that room."

Orenha thought as he left, and Flowerseorin, left alone, spent time staring blankly out a small window.

"Spirit Slayer... my hatred for him hasn't subsided. I do want to catch the culprit. But... recently, I learned something more important."

"Iphanel is alive."

Thanks to someone's grace, Iphanel was still alive. She couldn't forget. That night when the moonlight shone brightly on the world. The small, young boy standing in a martial arts uniform. When their eyes, as dark as the universe, met briefly, it felt like she was being sucked in.

"I must meet him."

She didn't know his identity or name. But she had to meet him somehow. Beyond the grace of saving Iphanel, he was... completely immune to her curse.

"...Someday, if I can freely go out into the world."

She would search for him. Flowerseorin thought as she closed her eyes. Today... she felt especially tired.
