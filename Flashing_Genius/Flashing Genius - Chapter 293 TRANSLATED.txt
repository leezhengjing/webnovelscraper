## Magic School Front Blink Genius Became Chapter 293: 54. League of Spirits (6)

The Stella Rio's League of Spirits team receives training in the most advanced environment, managed by professional coaches, a systematic medical system, and strategic analysis experts. It's only natural for Stella, which always produces the world's best players, to have such a system. However, there are only a few teams in the world with such a system. Perhaps only the "Team Phoenix" of the Adollevit royal family and the "Emperor Goldens" of the Scalven royal family can be compared.

"Did you find out?" Stella Rio's professional exam entrant, second-year professional Rio's student, Gayurin. Unlike magic warriors divided into classes from F to S, there was no specific "class" for other magicians, as there was no need to specifically divide them into ranks or classes. However, if Rio's class had classes and rankings, Gayurin would undoubtedly be ranked first in the S-class. If Mayuseong and Aizel are considered unrivaled geniuses among magic warriors, then Gayurin held that position among Rio's players.

"Ah, Full Flame team?" The coach, looking exhausted as if he had just returned, put down the chart. "I've analyzed it." 

"Tell me." The coach almost frowned at Gayurin's blunt tone but managed to hold back. "Well, it was peculiar. Very unique and amazing, worth seeing."

"Is it a threat to me?" Gayurin narrowed her eyes, and the coach slightly extended the chart. "No. Not at all. It's just unique, not your opponent. Do you want to see it yourself?"

"Let's do that. My eyes are more accurate than yours." The chart contained all the records of the Full Flame team's strategy, combat power, moving route and style, magic tree, item build, and meta.

"Zero..."

The first thing she checked was Full Flame. The magic tree was peculiar, using a unique type suitable for a magician specializing in light and plants, but it was nothing special. Among the players participating in Rio's, there were many who used magic even more unique than light and plants.

"Baiyuseol is a bit peculiar, but..."

"The strategy team is already creating a solution. They said they can complete an item build that perfectly counters it within 30 minutes. It's just that easy to deal with." 

It's because Baiyuseol always fights with monsters around him. The item effect activates after attacking the enemy ten times with a sword, but it's almost impossible to attack like that unless the enemy stands still like an idiot. Baiyuseol doesn't have any magic to block the opponent's movement, so he can only rely on the item, so if you counter it with blink magic and terrain control magic, you can counter him instantly.

"Baiyuseol isn't a problem. The most annoying thing is... as you predicted, Mayuseong."

Mayuseong, who occupied the central line, displaying defense as strong as a fortress and attack power like flames, was undoubtedly an amateur player. His item tree also followed a standard build without any flaws, and his strategy and tactics were borrowed from current players, improved with his own style, as recorded. However, that's about it. He will grow into a great player if nurtured, but he's still a baby. Even the reason he could win against the 12th-level AI was thanks to Baiyuseol's self-destructive attack. It's simply ridiculous.

"They're garbage you don't need to worry about."

"But don't relax. I have a bad feeling about these kids, especially this guy, Baiyuseol..."

"I'll judge that myself." Gayurin cut off the coach's words and entered her practice room.

"Sigh... " The coach rubbed his forehead and shook his head. "I wish the Full Flame team could beat Gayurin..."

Undefeated myth. Gayurin, a genius among geniuses who had never suffered a single defeat, had been on a winning streak. It's no exaggeration to say that there was no opponent for her among the current teen amateur players. That's why the coach was worried about her. Because she had never lost, she didn't know fear.

'Ah, come on.' Even so, the Full Flame team beating Gayurin? It was an absurd story, beyond just the team's mindset. After all, the Full Flame team's level was no match for Gayurin.

"What am I thinking." The coach shook his head and roughly threw the chart into a corner. He doesn't seem to need to see it again.

On Saturday, the Full Flame team's practice ended with a total of five matches. 2 wins and 3 losses against the 12th-level AI. They won two games in a row, but the last three were spent experimenting with their individual item tree development and build, and their own ideas, so a proper team fight didn't occur, ending in defeat. In the first place, the first match was a victory due to Mayuseong's solo effort, and the second match was a victory due to Baiyuseol's self-destruction, so it could be said that they won twice even though they were supposed to lose all five matches.

And Sunday passed, and Monday arrived. They didn't practice on Sunday. The reason was that Baiyuseol strongly suggested taking a break on the weekend. Actually, they weren't professional players who lived and died for Rio's, so Full Flame readily agreed. He also wanted to lie down and take a nap on Sunday.

"Do you know how humans move? They move through muscles. Muscles need oxygen and nutrients to contract and relax."

The professor's words, asking a question everyone knew, were incredibly boring for Baiyuseol. He was doodling something in his notebook with a pen. He had given up on studying a long time ago anyway. The notebook contained past strategies and item trees of Korean players from the Direct Blackbird Glasses, and on the other page, the upcoming episodes, Twelve Lunar Months, and other contents were densely written.

"Humans breathe to supply oxygen and eat food to digest and convert it into energy, which circulates through blood vessels to the entire body. The reason you feel weak when you're hungry and out of breath after doing strenuous work is because of this." The professor slapped the blackboard and said. "So, the question is, does the same metabolism occur in skeletons and zombies?"

Skeletons and zombies are dead bodies whose entire bodies have ceased to function, but they move. It's ironic. How can they move without muscles?

"The answer is, black magicians use black magic to implement it in muscles and nerves. It's amazing that they can implement the delicate structure of the body with black magic, but... ahem, ahem, we, as magicians, shouldn't praise them." 

He slowly looked around at the students and spoke in a low voice. "However, their techniques were worth copying. Implementing the body's structure with magic was something that magicians of that era couldn't even imagine."

It was a boring routine, so Baiyuseol yawned widely. Black magicians' black magic can do many things that ordinary blue white magic cannot. Therefore, they tried to steal that technology, but it was impossible, and in the process, it led to the development of other technologies... that's the gist of it.

"Black magicians' magic was so advanced that we couldn't get it, but magicians weren't bad either. We use mana for muscles..."

Just looking at that tone, blatantly praising black magicians, anyone could tell. That's right. That professor is a black magician. A newbie black magician who infiltrated Stella just recently? It's more strange that he's not caught with such blatant hints. He'll probably get caught by Full Flame or Aizel soon, get beaten up badly, and Eltman Eltwin will appear to deliver the finishing blow, turning him into dust and disappearing. 

Ding-dong~

The bell rang soon after the class ended, and Baiyuseol quickly got up, gathered his notebook and books, and left the classroom.

"Ah, uhm. I'd like you to organize this part and bring it in next time!"

As the students got up from their seats and rushed out in response to the bell, the professor quickly assigned homework, grabbed his textbook, and quickly opened the classroom door and ran out, catching up to Baiyuseol, who had already walked quite a distance. 

"Wait, Baiyuseol student. Let's talk."

"Yes? What is it?" He naturally spoke rudely because he knew the other was a black magician.

"Ahem, it's nothing, but... Professor Raydin asked me to ask you a favor."

Ah. 

He promised Professor Raydin that he would do him a favor in exchange for accepting Anella into Stella. This part was made into a "legal oath," one step below the "Mana Oath," so he couldn't break it. 

What is a legal oath? It's similar to a contract made in the real world. As the name suggests, if you break the promise, it means you'll be arrested or fined as a magician. It may seem like nothing, but Raydin holds the prestigious position of Professor of Stella, so he couldn't carelessly break a legal oath. If he broke it, he would have to resign from his position as Professor of Stella. 

Baiyuseol also had to keep the promise because if he broke it, he would be expelled. 

"Yes, but you know I won't do any unreasonable requests. I don't intend to do anything stupid for one student's transfer."

"Professor Raydin knows that. You don't doubt his judgment, do you?" It seemed that he trusted Raydin unconditionally, but it didn't matter to Baiyuseol.

"Yes. He's damn suspicious." 

The professor's expression briefly hardened, but he coughed and regained his poker face. "Anyway, this is that 'request.' Please complete it."

The professor handed him a note and disappeared into the hallway. Baiyuseol glanced around before checking the note. It's unusual for someone to ask a student this kind of favor, and it's normally impossible for them to accept. But Raydin's perspective was slightly different. Baiyuseol wasn't an ordinary student, and he must have believed that Baiyuseol could easily manipulate the points of the school competition if he wanted to.

"Maolun White... I've heard of them. A team composed of black magicians. I remember them from the original novel as the team that lost to Full Flame. I don't remember where or how they clashed. 

"It's not difficult." If the request was more uncomfortable, he would have refused, but if it was a team destined to lose to Full Flame in the future, he wouldn't mind giving them a boost. Besides, if it was match fixing, it was the area Baiyuseol, who grew up in the era of match fixing, was most confident in. He was 99% sure he could succeed, unless a lawyer who studied games suddenly appeared. 

'It's a bit uncomfortable to raise black magicians...' It can't be helped. It was important to fulfill Raydin's 'request' perfectly. It wasn't just for Anella's transfer. Unfortunately, Baiyuseol didn't think Professor Raydin could transfer Anella to Stella 100%. There were cases in the original game where Professor Raydin transferred students according to his own will, but that was only possible because the transferred student was a black magician.

However, wouldn't it be good if he failed? Since Baiyuseol had already fulfilled the 'request', Raydin would have to pay the appropriate price, but he would be in a situation where he couldn't. In other words, Raydin tried to make Baiyuseol owe him a debt, but instead, he ended up owing Baiyuseol a debt. 

'I'm sorry, Anella, but...' For now, she should be safe under the strict protection of Jelliel's Star Cloud Trading Company or Flower Bloom's Sky Flower Nursery. 

'I might as well enter as a junior next year since I look like a middle schooler.' Imagining Anella, the old woman, being delighted that she's gotten a year younger, Baiyuseol felt happy as well.
