### I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy

#### Chapter 220: Old Story (16)

The ending was already known. It was just the process that was unknown. The process I witnessed firsthand was truly devastating and horrifying.

Estimated risk level: 9. Classified as a "calamity" level by the public, requiring the immediate deployment of a national-level magic warrior unit upon its appearance.

- ...I failed to keep my promise once again.

At this moment, a single magician had fallen and was preparing for his last breath. No, to be precise... he was no longer a magician but a dark mage.

The whole world turned white. The pride of the Morpheus Grand Duchy, the Morpheus Forest, was completely burned and erased, and a cold glacier mountain stood tall in its place. The iceberg growing over the white flames was indeed alien, but it was a sight that could be called beautiful.

In the midst of it, a giant white fox beast lay fallen.

- For what reason did you stand against me? Will you lie and say it was for the world?

The white fox, Hwa-ryeong, opened her eyes with difficulty and asked Isaac Morpheus. His pale blue skin, long white hair, and the ice wings sprouting from his back made it questionable whether he could still be called Grand Duke Isaac Morpheus, but his personality remained unchanged.

Thus, he answered.

"...For my daughter."

He closed his eyes tightly. Each word was a struggle. A desire kept seeping into his mind. The desire to freeze everything in this world.

He clutched his chest and curled up. Isaac's condition was also far from normal after facing Hwa-ryeong. One of his ice wings was completely torn, and the white flames clinging to his body had almost evaporated his dark mana.

However, dark mana recovers faster than ordinary blue mana. Moreover, when dark mana is depleted like this, the instinct is to rampage and absorb the surrounding mana.

'It's dangerous.'

Baek Yuseol decided that Isaac Morpheus must be eliminated here. But how? No matter how weakened Isaac Morpheus was, it was impossible to face such a monstrous being alone. However, the entire magic knight squad was incapacitated. Even Hong Si-hwa Adolevit was unconscious.

'No, if I leave him like this... Isaac Morpheus will die anyway.'

There's no need to struggle. When a dark mana of this level appears, an emergency alarm is sent to all nearby magic towers, and the magic warriors are dispatched. The magic warrior unit will come fully prepared to face a powerful dark mage, and Isaac Morpheus, unable to recover his strength, will be killed by them. At most, it will take an hour? No, they will arrive within 30 minutes.

'I have nothing more to do.'

Having witnessed the truth here, I should be satisfied. It's time to leave. Let go of any lingering attachments.

As I thought so.

[Constellation Project loading complete.]

Suddenly, a system message was heard.

"...Haha. Are you doing this on purpose?"

Why did it have to appear at this timing, as if to remind me of its existence? He looked up at the stars in the sky and spoke.

"The gift you promised last time, I haven't received it yet. Is it okay to receive it now?"

He had completed numerous episodes and was promised a reward, but he kept postponing it because he didn't know what to receive.

"Now, I think I can receive something good."

He didn't know what narrative power was, but he had lived so hard that he thought he deserved a little generosity.

The countless constellations drifting in the night sky began to twinkle as if responding to his answer. Or maybe they had always been twinkling.

"...'Wheel of Dawn'."

Baek Yuseol nodded, and after a moment of waiting...

Flash!

Suddenly, a giant wheel appeared in the air and began to turn slowly. It was invisible to anyone else, only visible to Baek Yuseol.

It is a mysterious power plant that can store 'everything in this world'. Its original purpose is to continuously absorb and store the surrounding mana, then send it to the owner, allowing them to grow little by little without any special training.

In the game Aether World Online, it could only be used as an 'auto-growth item' or 'experience bonus item'... but now that it has become reality, what if it could store all the energy in the world as described?

"Rotation Assault Mode."

Baek Yuseol activated one of the functions of the Wheel of Dawn. Instead of using the function of 'absorbing and supplying energy to the owner continuously and steadily' for a month, it absorbs a tremendous amount of energy at once to temporarily enhance the owner.

...Boom!!

As it started to operate, the wheel of dawn, now visible to everyone, began to turn slowly. It started to absorb all the mana released by Hwa-ryeong and Isaac, scattering brilliant silver starlight.

[All stats increase by 80% for 10 minutes.]

[Absorbed Isaac's dark mana.]

[All stats increase by 80% for 10 minutes.]

Not stopping there, he used the derived skill absorbed by the Taeryeong Divine Art, [Breath of the Divine Beast].

[Breath of the Divine Beast, Second Form]

[Agility: Enhanced by 89%]

[Duration: 1 minute]

[Divine Beast Erosion increases.]

[The user's power is excessive compared to the skill, weakening the effect.]

Even though the effect of the Taeryeong Divine Art should have been amplified several times due to the blessing of the Silver Twelve Moons, the skill's effect was excessively weakened. But it was enough to face the weakened Isaac.

"...You are Baek Seol-gi."

As Baek Yuseol generated a tremendous vortex of mana, Isaac turned around to face him.

"Did you come to stop me?"

"Yes."

"I am in a very dangerous state right now... Are you sure?"

"I promised."

The one request Baek Yuseol received from Grand Duke Isaac Morpheus under the playful name 'Baek Seol-gi'.

"To protect Eijel."

"...I see. So that's it."

Isaac bit his lip and looked at Baek Yuseol with sad eyes.

"Then, please stop me."

He could no longer stop himself. His body was completely tainted with dark mana, on the verge of rampaging.

"...Understood."

With no one watching, he could be bold. He drew the Terrifon Sword and unsheathed the mana sword. It was much thicker and clearer than before, seemingly imbued with white flames and blue ice.

Zing zing zing!!

No matter how good the performance of the Terrifon was, the excessive mana caused it to overheat, making the staff vibrate as if screaming.

'Just hold on a little longer.'

He enveloped his body with the breath of the Taeryeong Divine Art and used teleportation. He charged at Isaac Morpheus and swung his sword.

Even though his base stats had become stronger, he could still only use four teleports. So Baek Yuseol diverted some of the mana absorbed by the Wheel of Dawn to the skill [Teleport].

He had wondered once. If this world was truly reality and not a game, perhaps the 'cooldown' of 3 seconds didn't actually exist.

Other magicians had to use a tremendous amount of mana to use teleportation. But not Baek Yuseol. He could use teleportation as much as he wanted after waiting just 3 seconds, even without any mana in his body.

The principle was simple. As a mana leakage retardant, he always absorbed natural mana into his body, and the mana gap created by using [Teleport] was quickly filled. So, the cooldown might actually be the time it took for Baek Yuseol's body to reabsorb the mana needed for teleportation from nature.

If he could accelerate the mana in his body very, very quickly, he might be able to reduce the cooldown of teleportation.

In reality, it was impossible. But with all the buffs from skills and items, and even the blessing of the Twelve Moons, giving him the power of over 8 stars, he might be able to achieve something that even the game character 'Baek Yuseol' couldn't.

Crash!!

As Isaac Morpheus reached out his hand, ice chains extended towards Baek Yuseol, who was charging at a tremendous speed. Even seeing this, Baek Yuseol didn't stop his charge and swung the Terrifon Sword, cutting through all the ice chains.

As if such tricks were not even a hindrance.

"Hup!"

When Isaac clenched his fist, the ice chains that had extended in all directions rushed towards Baek Yuseol all at once. He had assessed the mobility at the start of the battle and implemented the most efficient magic and strategy to counter it.

But.

[Teleport]

Baek Yuseol easily escaped from there, leaving Isaac astonished.

"Teleportation...!"

He had never heard of anyone controlling that magic in his lifetime. Isaac clenched his hand towards the sky, as if grabbing something and pulling it down.

Boom boom boom!!!

A giant ice mass appeared, piercing through the clouds. It was a spell he had cast to defeat Hwa-ryeong but couldn't use due to the depletion of his dark mana.

"Frozen Meteor, fall."

As the blue iceberg began to fall towards them, Baek Yuseol looked at it briefly.

'...This is absurd.'

He thought Isaac's power had weakened to about 8th class, but the spell he had cast earlier was still effective.

Crack, crack!

However, due to the lack of dark mana, the ice mass began to split into several pieces in mid-air. But could that be considered fortunate? The frozen meteor was now going to rain down.

"Please, dodge it well..."

Boom! Boom! Boom!!

The ice rain poured down. Baek Yuseol ran through it. He folded space several times, shattering the frozen meteor and splitting the iceberg, finally clashing swords with Isaac Morpheus.

Isaac Morpheus, who had never wielded a sword in his life, now swung a sword made of crystal as a dark mage.

Clang!!

As the Terrifon Sword and the crystal sword collided, the mana clash disrupted the balance of the air, sending tremendous waves in all directions. With each clash, white flames extinguished, and new icebergs formed and collapsed.

The falling frozen meteor was no longer an obstacle for Baek Yuseol. Instead, he used it as a stepping stone, moving three-dimensionally and chasing the flying Isaac Morpheus.

And.

Watching this scene.

Eijel Morpheus knelt and cried bitterly.

- Ah. The sight of the ones she loved most in this world pointing swords at each other's throats was something she never wanted to see, even in her dreams.

Yet, there was nothing she could do. The scene before her had already happened in the past.

- Please, stop...

Her voice couldn't reach them, echoing like a hollow sound in the air.

It was painful. She didn't want to see it anymore.

Boom!!

A part of the iceberg pierced Baek Yuseol's arm, and his Terrifon Sword finally cut through Isaac Morpheus's remaining wing.

- I don't want to see it anymore...

Baek Yuseol's blade pierced Isaac Morpheus's abdomen, and at the same time, his entire body was covered in ice, suffering from frostbite.

[Due to the blessing of the Silver Twelve Moons, Baek Yuseol forcibly removed the ice from his body, pulled out his sword, and tried to stab Isaac's heart again, but Isaac grabbed the blade of the Terrifon with one hand, preventing him from doing so.]

Crunch!!

Isaac's hand was ground by the blade of the Terrifon, and slowly, the cruel blue promise approached his heart.

'I will die soon.'

Even in such a situation, Isaac was smiling. He was relieved that he could die like this... He wouldn't harm his daughter, who was sleeping nearby, with his own hands. How fortunate.

He smiled in his final moments.

"...Thank you."

Thud!

Finally, Baek Yuseol's blade pierced Isaac's heart.

- No, no!!

Eijel Morpheus screamed. Her face was already covered in tears, making it hard to see properly, but she pounded Baek Yuseol's chest, trying to stop him.

- Don't do it! Please, don't do it! Dad will die!

But Baek Yuseol couldn't hear her voice. Kneeling on one knee, holding the sword that pierced Isaac's heart, he waited for a long time.

Did he need time to accept his death?

- Please, please...

Baek Yuseol, who had always listened to her, who had always come running for her, why wasn't he listening to her this time?

Flame looked at Eijel with a complicated expression from behind.

'In the end, it comes to this.'

He thought that even Baek Yuseol couldn't stop this event. But for it to end like this... Wasn't it too harsh?

Unable to bear watching any longer, he turned his head.

- ...Huh?

Swoosh!

As the life slowly drained from Isaac Morpheus's body, just as he was about to die completely, Baek Yuseol withdrew the Terrifon Sword without finishing him off.

If the heart of a dark mage is not completely destroyed, they will regenerate. Baek Yuseol knew this better than anyone, so why did he make such a decision?

"Isaac Morpheus. In the history I know... you died at the hands of Hong Si-hwa Adolevit."

Isaac could no longer respond. He was alive but barely conscious.

"Ugh."

In the distance, Hong Si-hwa Adolevit slowly got up. As the one commanding from the farthest distance, she was less affected by Hwa-ryeong.

And... the sound of thousands, tens of thousands of mana waves approaching from all directions. The magic warrior unit, detecting the 9-risk dark mage, was coming.

"We cannot change history."

So, leave history as it is. But what if we twist the truth that no one knows... just a little?

"People will remember it like this. Isaac Morpheus became a dark mage and rampaged, but Hong Si-hwa Adolevit stopped him."

"...What is this?"

Hong Si-hwa, who had just regained her senses, looked at Baek Yuseol's back with a bewildered expression. The fallen Hwa-ryeong and Isaac. And the masked man standing alone in front of them.

Baek Yuseol looked at Hong Si-hwa briefly, then reached out to Isaac.

"But in reality... you will go on a journey. This will be a secret known only to you and me."

Baek Yuseol activated the Wheel of Dawn again. This time, it started to rotate in reverse, containing countless amounts of Isaac Morpheus's mana.

No one knew where it would go. But one thing was certain. Since the Wheel of Dawn was not of this world, if it disappeared like this... it would drift to another world unknown even to Baek Yuseol.

As the Wheel of Dawn rotated in reverse, it began to absorb the surrounding spirits. The white soul rising above Isaac Morpheus's fallen body.

- Ah!

At that moment. For a very brief moment. Isaac Morpheus and Eijel's eyes met.

- Ah, Dad...

But before she could reach out, Isaac's soul walked towards the wheel and disappeared.

Baek Yuseol looked at his back one last time, then spoke to the air.

"Constellation Project."

"I will send back the Wheel of Dawn."

Flash!

A silver light flashed briefly. The giant wheel that had occupied this space disappeared.

With that, the situation was over. Soon, Baek Yuseol also disappeared like an illusion...

Thud thud thud thud!!

The magic warrior unit, arriving late, witnessed the horrific scene. The corpse of the dark mage Isaac Morpheus. And Hong Si-hwa Adolevit standing in front of it.

At that moment, the world began to contract, and space started to distort. Even in the strange sensation of time being accelerated, Eijel still stared blankly at the air.

- Ah.

Thud!

Eijel, who had collapsed to the ground, laughed. Tears were still streaming down her face, but she was laughing.

- So... Father didn't die...

This was the true history. Unknown to anyone. Now that she knew it, Eijel could no longer cry. She had hope, so she was no longer unhappy.

She closed her eyes tightly and wrapped her hands around her chest. How should she calm this trembling heart? She still didn't know anything. Where her father had gone. How to find him.

But in the end. If he didn't die. If his soul remained. Someday, she would surely... find him. So, from now on. Eijel... would not cry.
