# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy
## Chapter 159: Orb of Souls (3)

The Orb of Souls. It is known to have been bestowed by angels in the distant past, and only high elf elders can touch this item. It is the only treasure in the world that reveals how pure or tainted the owner's soul is. The more evil deeds one commits, the murkier the orb becomes, and the more good deeds one performs, the brighter it shines. A murderer's soul would appear dark gray, while a black mage and a spirit slayer's soul would be even darker, almost black.

The soul of Baek Yuseol, who is both a black mage and a spirit slayer, should naturally shine black.

"This... how..."

But why is it shining so brilliantly white? Not even a saint could possess such a color. Only beings with pure souls like angels and spirits could have such a perfect white.

'It's absolutely impossible for a human to emit such a color.'

However, doubting it was useless. It was not a magical trick; it was truly the light emanating from the Orb of Souls.

"Ah... I received it as a gift last time, and it turns out to be the Orb of Souls?"

When Baek Yuseol nonchalantly shook the pendant and spoke, people began to murmur. Not only was the Orb of Souls not formally handed over, but it was disguised as a gift? They wanted to shout that it was a conspiracy, but they couldn't. The moment they mentioned the 'Oath of Magic,' the truth would be revealed immediately.

According to the Magician's Pact, the Oath of Magic cannot be forced, even if the other party is a murderer. For a magician, mana is as vital as life itself, and forcing the Oath of Magic would cause the entire Magician's Association to rise up in protest.

However, Orenha had currently violated one of the taboos.

'Never accuse a magician of being a black mage without evidence.'

On Earth, there was a history of burning ordinary women as witches. Similarly, in Aether World, there was an incident where innocent magicians were accused of being black mages and massacred. This caused widespread societal chaos, leading the association to establish the taboo of never accusing a magician of being a black mage without evidence.

Although the taboo has almost disappeared in modern times, falsely accusing an innocent magician of being a black mage is an act that tarnishes their honor. And it wasn't just anyone; it was the Elf King's aide who committed such an act in an official setting. As a result of violating the taboo, he could be forced to take the 'Oath of Magic,' making it impossible to lie.

As Orenha clenched his fists and lowered his head, Eltman Eltwin finally returned to a calm expression.

"...Aide. Do you realize how big a mistake you've made, both diplomatically and as a magician?"

All the races and nobles attending the ceremony looked at Orenha with discomfort. Some were hostile, while others looked at him with pity.

"I don't know why you did this, but trying to tarnish the honor of a cadet who should have been praised in the most glorious moment will not be overlooked."

"Wait, stop...!"

Originally, he should have been the 'alpha' here. But instead, he became the 'beta.' Something was seriously wrong.

'This can't be happening!'

How could a human possess such a pure soul? How could a human emit an aura as pure as a spirit?

"Trickery..."

That was the only thing that came to mind, so he blurted it out, but it was just another mistake.

"Ha. Are you trying to tarnish the honor of the most precious and magnificent treasure of the high elves?"

"No, that's not it..."

"What proof do you have to claim trickery? Are you saying it's possible to deceive the Orb of Souls?"

The Orb of Souls is the most precious treasure to the elves. If it were deceived by a mere black mage's trick, that would be a significant problem.

'What have I done...'

One mistake led to another, and it became a sharp blade that tore through Orenha's chest. Cold sweat ran down his back. His head felt hot, but his brain seemed to have stopped functioning, leaving him with no thoughts. He could only wish this situation was a dream.

The weight of people's gazes felt like they were suffocating him. How ridiculous must they find him? He had boldly accused Baek Yuseol of being a black mage at the moment he was receiving an award, only to find out it wasn't true. For Orenha, who had always lorded over others, the current situation was so humiliating and despairing that he wanted to bite his tongue and end it all.

"...Wait a moment."

At that moment, a clear voice was heard, drawing everyone's attention. Was it because the voice was beautiful? Because it spoke out of nowhere in this situation? No, it wasn't that. It was as if... like a magnet. The moment the voice was heard, everyone instinctively turned to look at her.

No one looked at Orenha anymore. It was the Elf King, Kkot Seorin. She, who had always hidden herself in black cloth and avoided appearing in public, had finally shown herself after a long time.

Click-clack!

Even though tens of thousands of spectators were gathered, the sound of her heels echoed more clearly than anything else in the world. Even though she wore a dress that didn't reveal a single inch of skin, everyone held their breath and remained silent, just to look at her for a second longer.

Kkot Seorin stepped out of the barrier that had hidden her and stood in front of Baek Yuseol.

"I know a word can't make up for it, but... I apologize on behalf of my aide."

A king should not bow easily. Therefore, Kkot Seorin conveyed her apology with dignity and authority. However, the act of a king personally apologizing was a problem in itself, causing Orenha's face to turn pale. He finally realized the gravity of his mistake.

'Because of me, the king had to personally apologize to a mere human commoner.'

This realization hit him hard, leaving him gaping like a fish, unable to even breathe. Eltman Eltwin was also slightly surprised that Kkot Seorin personally apologized. Knowing how she avoided appearing in public due to an unknown curse, he could guess how much determination it took for her to step forward.

"...It wasn't something the Elf King needed to apologize for, but Stella will accept it."

"Yes. I hope you can forgive us."

Although the king stepping forward could make the situation quite complicated, it was the most certain way to quell the current conflict. It could have escalated into a diplomatic issue between humans and elves, but Kkot Seorin put an end to it.

'Well...'

Baek Yuseol also looked at Kkot Seorin with a peculiar gaze. She was known to be a hikikomori who rarely showed herself outside, but here she was, stepping forward. He had planned to thoroughly crush Orenha, but now it didn't matter. The act of Kkot Seorin personally apologizing was the most fatal blow to Orenha.

Because of this incident, Orenha lost Kkot Seorin's trust. This was a significant gain for Baek Yuseol. Kkot Seorin often took the bad ending route in the original game, mostly because of Orenha. If he could separate Orenha from her early on, the chances of her taking the bad ending route would significantly decrease.

"We've shown an unpleasant scene at this glorious award ceremony. Although it's a bit awkward for me to say, it was indeed a tumultuous event. The school competition award ceremony will end here, so I hope everyone enjoys the remaining festival."

Eltman quickly wrapped up the situation, and the host, who received his signal, swiftly took over the microphone.

-Next, we have the magical fireworks show by the Stella Isle Rock Troupe. Audience members, please...

As the award ceremony ended, an opaque barrier formed, isolating the stage from the outside. Thanks to this, Kkot Seorin, who was freed from the public's gaze, collapsed weakly into a chair.

"...Your Majesty, I have something to say."

Orenha approached Kkot Seorin to apologize, but she spoke without turning her head.

"Orenha."

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"You know what a spirit slayer means to me."

"...I know."

"But you tried to use it politically..."

She had initially said she wanted to have a quiet conversation with Baek Yuseol alone. But Orenha ignored all that and publicly disgraced the elves in front of all the gathered races. Kkot Seorin had trusted Orenha. No, she had believed in him. She had been willing to forgive any mistake he made. But this time, he had crossed the line. Not only did he use the spirit slayer, which left the deepest scar on her heart, but he also tried to bury Baek Yuseol, who might have saved Iphanel, in an official setting.

"Your Majesty, the truth is..."

He wanted to argue that it was for the eternal peace of the elves. But...

"Stop. I don't want to hear any more excuses. Go back and rest."

Then she asked Eltman.

"Thank you for your consideration earlier. I know it's rude, but... could I have a private conversation with Cadet Baek Yuseol?"

"I don't mind, but ask him yourself."

Baek Yuseol, who had been standing awkwardly while the other award recipients were leaving, widened his eyes when the attention turned to him. Kkot Seorin smiled weakly at him.

"I have something I really want to discuss with you personally."

* * *

Kkot Seorin left to have a private conversation with Baek Yuseol. Although the king had ordered him not to wait, Orenha stayed in Stella, waiting for her return.

"Damn it..."

In the VIP waiting room, in a corner of an empty room, he lowered his head and pulled at his hair with both hands. There were no mistakes. His reasoning, calculations, and evidence were perfect. But why did Baek Yuseol's soul emit such a bright light?

'It's a trick!'

He had no evidence, but he was sure. Baek Yuseol was definitely a spirit slayer and a black mage, hiding his true identity with some unknown technique.

'The king doesn't know that...'

He felt resentful that the king, who didn't even look at him, was so cold. He had worked so hard for her, and yet, for a single mistake, she treated him so coldly. Moreover, the warm gaze Kkot Seorin directed at Baek Yuseol made him feel even worse. What was the point of showing such a gaze to a filthy human she had just met today?

'Baek Yuseol... He must have used some dirty, despicable trick to deceive the innocent Kkot Seorin. I must save her.'

His fingertips trembled. He couldn't forget the gazes of the people. The contemptuous and hateful looks directed at him, the most noble and great high elf noble. And Kkot Seorin's cold gaze.

'I must... reverse everything.'

He had to regain her trust.

'How?'

He was an elite. He had handled everything perfectly until now, never allowing a single failure. So there was no need to panic over his first failure. Even monkeys fall from trees sometimes; such days happen.

What should he do to reverse everything? The first thing that came to mind was, of course, Baek Yuseol. The fundamental reason Orenha had fallen into such a pit. He didn't consider the foolish option of killing him. He would be more intelligent, more cunning. He would reveal Baek Yuseol's true identity and bring him down. That way, all the dishonor he had received would be restored.

Then he suddenly remembered the girl who had planned this with him from the beginning. His eyes gleamed.

'Jelliel. I need to meet her.'
