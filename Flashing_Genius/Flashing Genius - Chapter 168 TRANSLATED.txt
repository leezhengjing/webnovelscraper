# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 168

## 39. Urban Legend (4)

Hedrick Siriven was an ordinary boy enrolled in Class E of the first year at Stella Magic Academy. The fact that he had been admitted to Stella was already extraordinary, but here, he was just an average student, often ranking at the bottom. There were simply too many outstanding students above him. However, that was fine. Not all students constantly looked up, straining their necks. Hedrick was content with his rank and class. For the Siriven family, a mere baronial house on the frontier, having a student at Stella was a tremendous honor, and it had led to the family's significant revival. The once-ignored rural baron was now mingling with the city's nobility, all because Hedrick had been admitted to Stella.

"I have to go now."

"Going to the next class?"

"Yeah. My schedule is too tight."

"Even during summer vacation, you're working hard. Why not take a break?"

"Tell me about it. Especially since you're the one with the worst grades among us."

"Let's go play soccer."

Stella was full of geniuses, so Hedrick had to constantly strive and work hard. He didn't even hope to catch up with them. Just following closely behind and graduating would be enough for him.

"...I'm fine. I'll go ahead."

Unlike him, the students in Class D and C seemed to have plenty of free time, barely attending classes during the summer vacation and spending their days playing. 

'This summer... I'll surpass them.'

Friends? They were just rivals. While they played, he would grow stronger. With that thought, Hedrick walked down the corridor. His next class was in Botany. The botany lab was located in the third main tower, so Hedrick walked quickly. The distance from the sixth main tower to there was quite far. Fortunately, Stella had its own small warp holes and other means of transportation, allowing students to travel long distances comfortably. As usual, Hedrick walked towards the gate. Suddenly, he noticed a girl walking ahead of him, her appearance somewhat suspicious.

'A white uniform?'

Stella's uniforms had been black for over 50 years. But the girl's uniform was white with gold trim, clearly an old uniform. Suspicious. Given the recent incidents at Stella, the instructor's words about reporting anything suspicious came to mind.

'I need to catch and interrogate her.'

With a sense of pride as a magic warrior cadet and the opportunity to earn a commendation, Hedrick approached the girl without hesitation. However, no matter how much he walked, the distance didn't close. His strides were definitely longer. 

Tap! 

Hedrick, unable to close the gap by walking, started running. But no matter how much he ran, the distance remained the same, like a mirage.

"Huff... Huff, huff...!"

Out of breath, Hedrick suddenly realized he had passed through the gate. The warp hole gate, designed like an ordinary corridor door, was always used by many students. But something was off.

"...What?"

It was eerily quiet. This corridor should have led to the third main tower, but there was no one around. The third main tower, with its many labs, was usually bustling with research students. The abnormal silence was terrifying.

"What's... No, get a grip."

Swallowing hard, Hedrick took a step forward. This was Stella Academy. Nothing incomprehensible should happen here. Believing that firmly, he walked slowly, but saw no one. No researchers, professors, instructors, or students. No one. Realizing something was wrong, he hurriedly turned back to go through the gate again.

"...Huh?"

But the gate was gone. There was nothing but an ordinary corridor.

"This can't be."

Hedrick ran through the spot where the gate should have been, but nothing happened. Even when he turned back and passed the spot again, he felt no sensation of passing through a gate.

"How..."

Staring blankly at the spot where the gate should have been, he noticed something written.

[Seventh Main Tower]

A seventh tower that didn't exist in Stella. The words were clearly imprinted in Hedrick's eyes. Why did he suddenly think of the urban legend that students joked about? Unfortunately, Hedrick didn't know much about the legend. He had thought studying was more practical than getting caught up in such rumors. In other words, he had no idea what to do here.

"..."

Slowly stepping back, Hedrick turned his head and saw a large full-length mirror in the central corridor. It was an ordinary mirror found in the same spot in other corridors, but today it felt eerie. He found himself staring at the mirror, meeting his own eyes.

It was smiling. The reflection of him in the mirror was smiling, though he wasn't.

â€“ Hahaha!

The reflection waved at him, its smile twisting grotesquely as it seemed to approach him.

"...Ah."

It stared at him for a long time, then its mouth stretched downward as it spoke.

-You're not the one.

That was the last thing he remembered.

* * *

The first-year class bulletin board was unusually noisy. It was because of a recent announcement. As Angel passed by, she noticed a striking sentence and stopped. The content was simple. A single student had collapsed. It wasn't uncommon for students to faint from overstudying. But this case was too peculiar.

"Did you hear? When Hedrick was found collapsed, the corridor..."

"Yeah. I heard from someone who saw it. All the windows in the corridor were open, and 'You're not the one' was written on the wall."

"That's exactly like the urban legend, isn't it?"

"Is it still there?"

"The professors erased it all."

The uneasy atmosphere spread quickly among the students. It wasn't just an ordinary collapse; it was an incident that matched the recent urban legend. The school dismissed it as a prank, but no one believed it.

"Do you think something will really happen...?"

A student's casual remark left everyone silent, fearing it might come true.

"Hmm..."

Angel stared at the announcement, deep in thought. The recent incident could be dismissed as a coincidence. But she couldn't shake off the conversation she had overheard from Professor Raiden. 

'The seventh tower urban legend... What could it be related to?'

She knew the legend well. Her best friend, Marillen, was very sociable and sensitive to trends and rumors, constantly talking about them during meals. Thanks to her, Angel had extensive knowledge of the legend. The place where Hedrick disappeared was also on the way from the sixth to the third main tower, matching the legend exactly. It was just a legend, but something bothered her. However, her friends were too delicate and needed protection to share her thoughts with. If Baek Yuseol were at school, she would have confided in him immediately, but unfortunately, he was away.

'What should I do...'

As she hesitated, time passed, and the students dispersed. With no other choice, Angel was about to leave when she saw someone ahead. A girl with short black hair, Flame, was walking with a girl with pigtails, reading something. Angel suddenly thought of something. Even if it wasn't Baek Yuseol, Flame, who shared many secrets and truths with her, could be trusted. She was one of the few people she could confide in.

'The incident is already happening.'

Even if it was a misunderstanding, it would be better to speak up. If what she knew could help solve the mystery, it was worth a try. She didn't want to hate the world, even though she had been hated by it. The thought of her friends getting hurt was unbearable. Having experienced such things before, she couldn't ignore this incident. 

Her decision made, Angel approached Flame and grabbed her.

"...Excuse me, can I talk to you for a moment?"

"Huh? Angel?"

"Yes."

Flame, who rarely initiated conversations, looked at her with wide eyes. Though she appeared like a cute little sister, Flame knew that Angel's inner strength was like a fortress. So, without hesitation, Angel shared what she had discovered.

"I have something to tell you."

After leaving the Celestial Tree's cradle, I didn't return to Stella immediately. The summer vacation was a crucial period for me. The events within Stella alone had their limits in helping me grow stronger. I had to combine external sub-events and dungeons to grow. Training was yielding excellent results. I had become proficient in controlling teleportation through the Taeryeong Divine Art and breathing techniques, confident enough to face a third-class mage without being overwhelmed. But it wasn't enough. As a player, the most efficient way to grow was to gain experience points. The protagonists were already looking beyond the fourth class, while my growth was too slow. To protect and support them and prevent the impending crises, I needed to be at least as strong as them. 

I had caught a decent event at the Sparrow Glasses to find a 'Divine Artifact' for Flower Frost and prepare for the upcoming Black Horse Invasion. 

At the city's entrance, a large billboard greeted me. The billboard was old and some letters were unlit, making it hard to read. A city full of romance and dreams? The city of Malentailles was practically a giant slum. The city's atmosphere was dead. The streets lacked vitality, and people walked silently, each going their own way. The residents, looking malnourished, wore rags. I walked among them, having changed out of my Stella uniform into ordinary clothes. Wearing the prestigious Stella uniform in a slum would only make me a target of fear and hatred. Despite wearing ordinary clothes, my appearance, polished from my time at Stella, drew people's stares.

'They're glaring at me...'

There were hardly any magic warriors or mercenaries in the city. There were no prey to hunt. The city had no special products or advantageous location, and even magic warriors rarely visited, so it was dying. But a great treasure lay hidden here. Long ago, the 'Petal of a Gentle Heart' hidden by Yeon Hongchun Samwol was here. Moreover, one of the most popular events in the game, [There Was No One There], was set to take place here. The event's completion experience points were substantial, attracting many players. But seeing the desolate city in reality felt strange.

'I wonder if Flame is doing well.'

The original story had changed so much that I was quite anxious, but I trusted Flame. Despite being a protagonist who often died from poor choices, she always overcame every situation with her best efforts, making her the ideal protagonist. She was probably investigating the Black Horse Invasion with passion, as I had asked. By the time I finished this event and returned, the episode would likely be starting, so I needed to hurry back. 

First...

I glanced around and walked down a dark, gloomy alley. A group of shabby-looking people began to gather around me. An old woman and a beggar blocked my way, while a woman with disheveled hair staggered towards me. Ignoring them, I tried to pass, but the woman suddenly grabbed my shoulders and shouted.

"Why!!! Why are you ignoring me after making eye contact!!"

My eardrums almost burst. I stared at her without any change in expression. Thanks to Yeon Hongchun Samwol's blessing, I wasn't startled or scared by such things. Even without it, there was no reason to be afraid.

"Why, why! Why!!!"

She kept shouting, but when I didn't react, she slowly backed away. Again, 'disheveled appearance.' She was pretending to be crazy to scare ordinary people.

"...What, what are you staring at?"

Seeing my indifferent expression, she got scared and let go of my shoulders, backing away.

"That's enough."

After a moment, a man in a coat and fedora appeared in the alley. He pushed aside the beggar and the passersby and approached me, pulling the disheveled woman back.

"Student, please understand. The people here are half out of their minds because of the recent bad incidents."

"I know. Ghosts keep appearing, right?"

"...You came here knowing that? Because of the ghost rumors, airships don't come, and trains have stopped, so visitors are rare."

"It took me a while to get here."

"I see. You must be interested in the rumors."

He took out a pipe and started smoking. The beggar and passersby slowly backed away, and the woman, glancing at me, quickly disappeared into the alley. The man smoked for a while, then spoke without looking at me.

"Then, let me ask. Are you a human or a ghost?"

"What if I say I'm a ghost?"

"I'll exorcise you."

Not just exorcise, but annihilate. He must really hate ghosts. I knew this man well. He was one of the few ghost hunters in Aither World, 'Pung Ryujin.'

"But... A ghost wouldn't say it's a ghost, so it doesn't matter if you're human or ghost."

"Thank you."

I intended to help him. Not only because he was the protagonist of this sub-event, but also because he had an item that would be very useful for the upcoming Black Horse Invasion. Honestly, even though I had told Flame to prepare for the Black Horse Invasion episode, no matter how much she prepared, there wouldn't be a proper solution. If the original game went as usual, Flame would go through all sorts of hardships and suffer greatly, with many casualties within Stella. So, it was right for me to return to Stella immediately to respond, but it was pointless. There was no way I could solve it alone. But the solution lay outside. Pung Ryujin's artifact, the 'Soul of the Dead Talisman.' If I could bring that back, the difficulty of the Black Horse Invasion episode would drop significantly. I felt sorry for Flame, who was probably struggling right now...

'Just hang in there a bit longer.'

This brother will bring back a cheat item and solve everything in one go.
