# I Became a Teleportation Genius at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 210: Old Stories (6)

It had been over a week since the expedition team, which included Eijel and Flame, had been wandering the Karakorn Mountains. Though the term "expedition" sounded grand, in reality, it was more akin to a battle against oneself. Traversing through terrain hostile to humans, fighting monsters, enduring uncomfortable nights in the wild, and then resolutely moving forward again. It was a journey that one could only endure with robust physical and mental strength.

"Those kids... they don't seem to get tired."

"No, they're exhausted. They're just enduring it."

In that sense, it was only natural that the way the expedition members looked at Eijel and Flame gradually changed. Initially, they thought of them as naive students. However, as they realized that the two had mastered various useful skills that could aid the expedition, they began to recognize their substantial presence. They were serious when needed, fought with all their might, and during breaks, they would chatter incessantly to lift the mood or help the team with various skills. Their presence in this expedition was by no means insignificant.

Flame mingled with various people, but Eijel did not. Though her wariness had significantly lessened by now, having lived for nearly ten years branded as the child of a traitor, it was difficult for her to easily approach others. Thus, after a day's exploration, Eijel would lie down in a makeshift tent next to Flame and share her old stories only with her.

"...Flame, what do you think of my father?"

It was a difficult question. She had never had a friend who asked about her father before. But then again, Eijel was not an ordinary friend. She was not an ordinary girl, student, or even an ordinary human. She was... a very special existence. However, Flame, who had no intention of treating her specially, spoke her mind honestly.

"I don't know."

"...Is that so?"

"Yeah. To be honest, I've never really heard about who your father is. Living in a rural orphanage, digging up potatoes every day to survive, why would I care about things happening in other places?"

Flame and Eijel shared their childhoods. Flame had over ten younger siblings and had to survive on five potatoes a day. She wanted to grab the neck of the crazy headmistress and shake her, but she couldn't because she was only ten years old at the time. Flame's childhood was one of scarcity, both in clothing and food.

"My father always told me to follow the path I believed was right. Now, I'm not sure what is right anymore."

Eijel's childhood was spent with her always reliable and respected father. When they were alone, Eijel would often share her stories, and Flame would listen quietly. Recollection is a truly beautiful and mysterious word. It allowed even ordinary humans to travel through time. Whenever Eijel reminisced, Flame would say nothing. Or rather, she couldn't say anything.

"Even if we fail in this journey, it doesn't matter. I know it won't be easy. But someday, I will clear my father's name."

In Eijel's memories, 'Isaac Morf' was a righteous and upright father. A great wizard who stood firm like a giant pillar on this land, protecting the world with his strong beliefs.

"Hey, Eijel."

Carefully, Flame spoke up.

"Yes, go ahead."

"Just in case, hypothetically speaking, if by any chance..."

She hesitated, trying to ask something, but...

Was the timing bad?

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!

The alarm of the barrier set up outside the tent rang loudly, signaling an emergency.

"Wake up! Everyone, wake up! It's an emergency!"

"What, what is it?"

It was their first time experiencing such a situation, so they hurriedly crawled out of the tent in confusion. The other expedition members had already woken up, gathered their equipment and staffs, and assembled. Though they were not soldiers, their preparations were so neat that they were ready for battle at any moment. Most of them were 4th-class wizards, but they showed the seasoned appearance of veterans, unlike Flame and Eijel.

"What's the situation?"

The expedition leader asked with a stern expression, and the watchman, still unable to hide his confusion, stammered.

"Over there, over there... It's better to see it for yourself than to explain!"

Following his words, the entire expedition headed deep into the mountains without even packing up the temporary campsite.

'What is this?'

A thick sense of unease started from the heart, traveled through the veins, and settled in the brain.

"...Where is Kyla?"

And one of those uneasy feelings was directly addressed by the expedition leader.

"Huh? Now that you mention it... Kyla. The veteran adventurer who suggested including the two students from Stella in the expedition. She was always involved in important decisions, but she wasn't here at this crucial moment?

"Hey, where's Kyla? What happened?"

The expedition leader asked, and the watchman, with a grimace, replied.

"She's... missing."

"...What?"

"She suddenly needed to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and went into the forest. There was no reason to stop her."

Watchmen work in pairs. Kyla was also on watch, but she went into the forest to use the bathroom and never returned. Though Kyla acted like a man, she was genetically female, so it was awkward to interrupt her while she was doing her business. But after 30 minutes, sensing something was wrong, they went into the forest to find her.

And then...

"...We found this place."

At the location they finally reached, there was a massive... city. To be precise, it was a ruin. The ruins of a city that had perished in ancient times.

"How... how is this possible...!"

Even the veteran expedition leader was so shocked that he couldn't say a word. In this situation, anyone would be the same. Except for one person. Flame.

'We've finally arrived.'

The name of the ruined city before them was 'Karakornia.' It was a small kingdom that had flourished long ago but suddenly disappeared from the map overnight, leaving behind a mystery. That was over 900 years ago, and it was now almost forgotten in history, regarded only as a legend.

"How can this be...?"

Many expeditions had been sent here. Most of those present, including the expedition leader, had explored the Karakorn Mountains multiple times. Yet, they had never discovered such ruins.

"That's not the only strange thing."

One of the expedition members said as they slowly walked towards the city.

"Look at that."

The member pointed to the air. There was a building in the process of collapsing. This was an accurate description. A building in the process of collapsing... frozen in time. There were several such structures. It was a mysterious scene, as if someone had captured the moment and painted it.

"That's not all. If you look closely... the city isn't old at all."

Normally, a city that perished long ago would be referred to as 'ruins' in modern times. But this city was too new to be called ruins. Though slightly worn and broken, it didn't look that old.

"But that flag is definitely Karakornia. I've read the legends multiple times, so I know!"

"I'm not saying it's not Karakornia! That's what makes it even stranger."

"This is driving me crazy. Seriously."

In a normal situation, one might feel fear. But adventurers are different. The expedition leader wiped his face with both hands. The emotion in his eyes was not fear. It was curiosity. And excitement. He smiled, showing his teeth, with a flushed face.

"I don't get it. I don't understand how such a thing can exist. Why this happened. I don't know anything..."

Another expedition member chimed in.

"That's why it's even more exciting..."

The expedition leader turned to the entire team.

"Is there anyone here who wants to turn tail and run away now?"

No one raised their hand. Instead, everyone looked at the leader with excited expressions, as if asking when they would start.

Satisfied, the leader nodded.

"Normally, we should return to the base and organize a proper expedition... but we can't do that because we have a missing person. How can we abandon a comrade and go back? We need to find that crazy woman!"

"Yes, sir!"

"Search every inch! Don't miss even an ant's corpse!"

The expedition members formed teams and dispersed. Eijel and Flame... did not follow anyone. Normally, they would have teamed up with Kyla, but she was missing.

"What should we do?"

Eijel asked with a tense expression. She had relied on Kyla, and her disappearance was worrying.

"We should go too."

Flame said to Eijel.

"We have the weapon of knowledge. Though we know nothing about this city... one thing we do know is that the sacred artifact of the Silver Crescent Moon is here."

"...Right."

"Follow your instincts. It's not difficult. There is no set path, so the place you walk will become the path."

Eijel looked over the ruined city and nodded.

"Indeed, it's better not to investigate the most suspicious places."

Such places would be searched by the expedition leader and veteran adventurers.

"You won't go to such obvious places, right?"

"Yes. And actually... since we arrived, I've felt a strong pull towards a certain place."

Eijel looked at the city. Karakornia had a different appearance from modern cities, resembling a tangled mass of cubes. Though her view was limited, one particularly tall tower stood out. It was an ordinary tower, but it was strangely hard to look at, as if someone didn't want it to be seen.

"...Really?"

Flame smiled faintly. Now that they had come this far, there was no stopping them. In fact, it was inevitable from the moment 'Kyla' found them.

"Then, shall we go? Let's be the first to find it!"

"Yes... of course."

Eijel walked ahead confidently, and Flame followed with a worried expression.

The search team of the Full Moon Tower, the Black Team, had been smoothly tracking Melian's whereabouts since Baek Yuseol joined them. According to Haeseongwol's theory, Melian had not perished but was bound somewhere, and Baek Yuseol's method of reverse-tracking the location of the ancient Karmenset dungeon was quite successful.

"We found it."

They found it much faster than when the expedition led by Jelliel discovered the ruins of the ancient Karmenset. Each keyword Baek Yuseol provided hit the mark, and with the Black Team, the world's best search team, working on-site, it was only natural.

"This place is..."

The location was not entirely unfamiliar. It was the 'Forest of the Silent Maze' in the center of the Hawol Plains. This place completely prohibited the entry of ordinary species, as entering it would cause one to lose their sense of direction and make it difficult to escape. Nowadays, advanced magical equipment allowed for entry, but there was no need to do so. However, Baek Yuseol's tracking device pointed to the Silent Maze.

"A moving ruin... When we completely cleared the ancient Karmenset ruins and won the Soul Chess, the ruins disappeared without a trace. We thought they had completely vanished, but they had moved to another location."

"I see. Judging by the waves, this dungeon is not bound by spatial coordinates."

The Black Team's wizards seemed to understand the mysterious situation magically and nodded.

"Yes. The problem is not space, but time is the key for Karmenset."

When Baek Yuseol answered, the wizards huddled together to discuss.

"Hmm, then does that mean the theory of spiral time particles by Philipes is correct? I need to write a paper on this."

"No, that's not it."

"Why not?"

"According to the theory of spiral time particles, the ancient Karmenset ruins should have moved to a 'different time' rather than a 'different place.' But since it was discovered here less than two weeks after Jelliel cleared the ancient Karmenset, it proves that it didn't escape the temporal constraints."

"Oh, I see. But couldn't it have appeared twice in a row in the present due to the randomness of time?"

"Let me explain the probability of a dungeon appearing twice in a row in the present out of the countless times since the birth of magic a thousand years ago."

"...That's a terrifyingly low probability of less than 0.000001%. My theory is flawed. I need to revise it."

Jelliel followed Baek Yuseol, staring blankly at his back. Not only did he freely command the Black Team, but he also discussed magic with them on equal footing. Most of the time, Baek Yuseol was right.

'Is he really a year younger than me?'

Jelliel had always considered herself a genius, but the comparison was stark.

'What if I had studied magic instead of leading the Star Cloud?'

No. It would still be insufficient. Baek Yuseol was an expert in 'all fields' of magic... possessing knowledge beyond that of a professor. Even if Jelliel had studied magic, she would have excelled in only one subject at best. The gap was insurmountable. The more of a genius one is, the more clearly they feel the gap. However, instead of feeling jealous... she felt relieved. The perfect boy was now a reliable ally, doing his best to find her father.

"...How about focusing instead of staring at him?"

"Huh?"

When Haeseongwol spoke from behind, Jelliel stammered, clearly flustered. It was such a rare occurrence that Haeseongwol couldn't help but laugh.

"You've been staring at that boy's back as if you want to bore a hole through it. Focus now. The Maze Forest will make you lose your way if you let your guard down even for a moment."

"Oh... I didn't realize. I wasn't even aware of what I was doing. This is so unlike me."

Jelliel's face turned red. Was it out of embarrassment? She wasn't sure. Perhaps even Jelliel herself didn't know.

'Get a grip. I don't deserve this.'

She had accumulated countless sins and karma, and now she was distracted by something else. It was utterly disgraceful. After taking a deep breath with her eyes closed, Jelliel's gaze changed completely when she opened them again.

'I need to be more composed.'

Anyone who knew her might find it awkward to hear her say that, as she had never been anything but composed. Jelliel was currently experiencing confusion due to strange emotions she couldn't control.
