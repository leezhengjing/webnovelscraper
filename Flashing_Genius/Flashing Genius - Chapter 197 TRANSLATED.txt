### Chapter 197: Everything Melts (2)

**Adolevit Kingdom, Capital Tehalan.**

This city was not exactly known for its pleasant atmosphere. Although it had developed as a tourist destination, the weather was generally gloomy and cool. However, when Hong Biyeon returned after finishing everything at the coast of Levian, Tehalan had changed significantly.

*...It's beautiful.*

For the first time, Hong Biyeon thought Tehalan was beautiful. A city that had felt like a shackle now seemed so beautiful just because the clouds had cleared and the warm sunlight was shining down. Or perhaps... it was because she was being treated differently than before.

"Princess's carriage procession!"

"Move aside!"

"Princess!! Please look this way!"

"Just one photo, please!"

As the rumor spread that the third princess of Adolevit had entered the capital, the streets were already filled with citizens. The sound of camera shutters overlapped so much that it no longer felt like noise, and the cheers had become so familiar from hearing them in other cities along the way. Citizens lined every main road leading to the Frost Palace, cheering for Hong Biyeon.

The coast of Levian was not far from the city of Tehalan, so the aftermath of the disaster had reached here as well. Despite it being midsummer, the temperature had suddenly dropped below freezing, and the entire sky had turned red with dark clouds, sparking red lightning. Having experienced such horrific phenomena firsthand, the citizens couldn't help but realize the magnitude of what Hong Biyeon had accomplished.

The carriage she was riding in made a large circle around the capital of Tehalan before slowly entering the Frost Palace. At the main gate of the Frost Palace, a military band and honor guard of over 500 were lined up, a treatment vastly different from before. Previously, there had been no welcome at all, to the point where it was uncertain whether Hong Biyeon had even entered the palace.

Of course, no matter how great her achievements, such a lineup wouldn't happen unless ordered by the queen. Therefore, this reception held a very special meaning for Hong Biyeon. It meant that Queen Hong Seryu had acknowledged her.

"The third princess is entering!!"

The lion's roar, amplified by mana, echoed through the heavens and the earth. The grand sound of trumpets and the start of the military band's music made her heart flutter. Hong Biyeon tried to maintain a calm and indifferent expression as she quietly looked out the window. In the future, all these events would become a matter of course for her, so she must not get excited.

"Her Majesty is waiting."

Upon arriving at the palace, the queen's personal guard greeted her.

"I understand."

Hong Biyeon lightly gestured with her chin, instructing them to lead the way. The personal guard bowed their heads and guided her to the queen's audience chamber.

"You're here."

Upon arriving at the audience chamber, Queen Hong Seryu, looking utterly exhausted, greeted her. The dark circles that couldn't be hidden by makeup and the mountain of documents showed how much she had been through. Considering the grave mistake she had made, it might be fortunate that it ended with just this much.

"Sit."

Normally, Hong Seryu wouldn't even lift her eyes from the documents, but upon Hong Biyeon's arrival, she set aside the mountain of papers and clasped her hands, making eye contact.

"Coffee?"

"You know I don't like coffee."

"...I didn't know. My apologies."

For a long time after that, Hong Seryu didn't speak, and Hong Biyeon just waited. The silence felt incredibly awkward, especially since she wasn't even drinking coffee. Eventually, it was Hong Seryu who first broke the silence. She sighed and spoke.

"I sincerely thank you for what you did the other day."

At those words... Hong Biyeon's heart sank for a moment. She never imagined it. That the day would come when Queen Hong Seryu herself would bow her head. Who would have thought they would hear an apology from the queen so easily?

"I was wrong. And you corrected it."

"You were the first to control the Fire Spirit Flower in a thousand years and melted the curse of eternal winter at the coast of Levian. And..."

Hong Seryu spoke firmly.

"I must admit that I have acted unfairly until now. I sincerely apologize for that as well. Can you accept my apology?"

One might say she was being too proud for someone who had done wrong, but a queen must be like that. No matter how wrong she was, it would be undignified for the Queen of Adolevit to bow her head to someone. In that sense, Hong Seryu was the exact model of the queen Hong Biyeon wanted to become.

"Yes. I will accept it."

Therefore, Hong Biyeon also raised her head and accepted Hong Seryu's apology indifferently.

"Thank you."

The queen handed Hong Biyeon a book and a stack of documents.

"From now on, you will receive the formal royal education that you were denied due to my personal feelings. There will be no discrimination in anything. From education to food, lodging, even down to the spoon. Compete on equal footing with the first princess."

Finally, no more of this tiresome discrimination. Just as Hong Biyeon was about to take the documents, Hong Seryu added.

"But."

"..."

"Before you accept this, there's something I want to say."

Hong Biyeon adjusted her posture again. Since she would receive it anyway, there was no need to rush and appear desperate.

"Yes. Go ahead."

"I owe you an unrepayable debt. That's why I'm doing this embarrassing and ridiculous thing now."

However, Hong Seryu continued.

"But... I still hate you. This feeling... has been etched into my heart since the moment my daughter died and cannot be erased."

Hong Biyeon met the queen's eyes indifferently. Even though she was saying she still hated her, she felt nothing anymore. Whether the queen liked her or hated her, acknowledged her or not, it no longer mattered to her.

"However, I no longer want to make irrational decisions driven by emotions. So, I will tell you a secret that I have kept from you."

"A secret?"

Hong Seryu spoke in a dry tone, as if it were not a significant matter.

"Direct descendants of Adolevit die before they turn 30."

"...Ah."

"And those with the talent for fire like you... find it difficult to even reach 20."

It felt like a hammer had struck her chest, sending a violent vibration through her body. However, Hong Biyeon did not even tremble a finger. Was it because she couldn't believe it? No. Although she hadn't known until now, she had vaguely suspected it.

"The only way to overcome the curse is to become the queen and receive the crown. That's why every Adolevit in history has fought fiercely. To become the king, to survive."

Hong Seryu murmured in a bitter voice as she touched her crown.

"In cases like your mother, who inherited a faint bloodline, they can extend their lifespan a little by giving up all flames and magic, but that is a painful and dishonorable thing."

Would a mage have a reason to live if they gave up magic? Who knows. Even so, Hong Biyeon's mother chose to live that way. Despite no longer being able to become the queen, she chose to live like that.

...Could it be?

For a moment, her heart sank. Her mother, who had always been harsh to her. Who had never shown her a warm gaze, always subjecting her to harsh education and punishment, her mother Hong Iel. She must have known. The terrible curse etched into the bloodline of Adolevit. That's why, as soon as she realized she couldn't become the queen, she felt sorry for her child. Knowing that she and her child would have no place in Adolevit and wouldn't receive proper education, she gave up all royal duties and magic and became a professor at Stella.

"Ugh."

Hong Biyeon clenched her hair and closed her mouth. Seeing her like that, Hong Seryu said something she thought she would never say.

"So, personally, I don't want you to become the queen."

"...Is that the same old story?"

"No. The current me is not foolish enough to make irrational decisions driven by personal feelings."

Hong Seryu's eyes were clearer than ever.

"You... can overcome the curse without the crown. If you succeeded in controlling the Fire Spirit Flower, it wouldn't be impossible to erase the curse etched into the bloodline by the Fire Incarnate."

Since it was the first time she had heard such a thing, Hong Biyeon didn't react, and Hong Seryu shook her head and sighed.

"Still, it might seem pointless. You want to become the queen, and the second princess seems to have no intention of becoming the queen..."

"What? Wait, what do you mean by that?"

The second princess, Hong Siwha, has no intention of becoming the queen? That can't be. She has been hindering me from becoming the queen all this time, even trying to take my life. However, Hong Seryu shook her head, saying it was nonsense, and stood up.

"Take these documents and go back. Although the vacation is almost over, I will ensure you receive proper education."

"Understood..."

The conversation ended there, and Hong Biyeon left the audience chamber, filled with bewildering questions.

"Princess, shall we return to Cheongryeong Palace immediately?"

The personal guards approached her and asked. Since Yeteryn had not returned yet, she was with them, but it was still awkward.

"No. Let's go to the inner palace for a moment. There's someone I need to see."

Thinking there was nothing to do even if she returned to Cheongryeong Palace immediately, Hong Biyeon thought of Baek Yuseol, who would be staying in the inner palace. When she found his personal quarters after passing through the royal library, he had already finished packing.

"What?"

Since there wasn't much luggage, he had cleaned out the dormitory and only had a large suitcase standing there, but the atmosphere was so cold. Baek Yuseol smiled awkwardly.

"Ah, I was going to tell you in advance, but you seemed so busy... I have things to take care of during the rest of the summer vacation."

"I see..."

The 'things to take care of' that Baek Yuseol mentioned wouldn't be something a normal teenager could handle. Despite having just experienced an enormous event that she never wanted to go through again, he was heading somewhere to solve something as soon as he woke up.

*Don't go.*

The words reached the tip of her tongue, but she couldn't say them. She still had too many shortcomings to follow Baek Yuseol's path and handle it.

*...Endure it.*

Wait a little longer. The day she becomes the queen. When that day comes, she will share everything with Baek Yuseol. However, not wanting to wait endlessly until then, Hong Biyeon cautiously spoke to Baek Yuseol.

"...Later. After graduating from school, where do you plan to go?"

"Huh? Well... I haven't really thought about it."

"Then, come back to the Frost Palace."

That was something Hong Biyeon had said after much contemplation and with great courage.

"At that time, I will hire you as an official knight, not a temporary palace guard. You will become the queen's personal guard."

"Queen Hong Seryu's?"

"No! Queen Hong Biyeon's!"

...Silence. After saying it herself, she felt like she had said something incredibly embarrassing and shameful, so even the confident Hong Biyeon couldn't help but open and close her mouth like a person with a glitch.

"Haha."

Baek Yuseol broke the awkward silence with a refreshing laugh. Then he slung his backpack over his shoulder and said.

"A queen's knight. It might be too much for me, but it would certainly be an honorable position."

"That is..."

Just as she was about to say something, Baek Yuseol finished speaking first.

"But, it's not the right time yet. I have too many things to take care of while I'm still alive, and I'm not sure if I can handle all of them. So, when all those worries and concerns are resolved..."

He passed by Hong Biyeon and whispered in a small voice, with a slight smile.

"Ask me again then. As a queen."

With that, Baek Yuseol disappeared, and Hong Biyeon stood there for a long time, as if nailed to the spot. The sunset shining on the girl's face was particularly beautiful that evening.
