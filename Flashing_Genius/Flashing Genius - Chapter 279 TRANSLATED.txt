The fortress surrounding the Wind Kingdom had three layers, two of which were protected by magical wards, making it nearly impossible for foreign forces, beasts, or monsters to invade. However, the last layer, built long ago, had lost its magical function and now served as a tourist attraction. The influx of people was so dense that it was difficult to find your companions if you were separated. 

“Are you telling me to find a shaman here?” Anella sighed heavily. The scenery was beautiful, but the sheer number of people made her feel queasy. As a Black Mage infiltrating in secret, she had already been avoiding crowded places, so she wasn’t sure if touring the tourist attractions was the right thing to do. 

‘They’ll show up eventually…’. The old amulet seller had said that the young shaman didn’t appear every day, but occasionally strolled around when she felt like it. Apparently, there were people who roamed the area every day, hoping to meet her, but most failed. Honestly, Anella didn’t have high expectations either. There were countless people who spent days searching without finding her, so it was unlikely she would stumble upon the young shaman by chance.

Thud! While she was walking, lost in admiration for the fortress path, someone bumped into Anella’s shoulder. The opponent was incredibly strong, pushing Anella back slightly… This was strange. If shoulders had collided, it meant the other person was also small in stature, but Anella, a Black Mage who excelled in physical strength, possessed superhuman strength even without releasing her Black Magic. Something wasn't right. Rather than feeling annoyed, Anella felt an eerie sensation, her expression turning icy as she retreated slightly. The opponent, who had their face hidden behind a straw hat, slowly raised their head. As the hat lifted, a mask covering the eyes became visible. A pure white cat mask. Without needing a detailed description, she knew instantly. It was undoubtedly the mask the old amulet seller had mentioned. ‘The young shaman’. However, why did fear overtake her instead of joy? 

“Oh my?” A smile formed on the lips of the revealed girl. She approached Anella slowly, gracefully like a cat. Then, she raised her chin, bringing it close to Anella’s. Anella’s gaze was forced onto the girl’s lips. Crimson lips, like fresh blood. 

“Cute little Black Mage. What brings you here? Did you come to see me?” What should she say? Anella shook her head, but the girl’s smile only deepened. 

“You can’t lie to me~ It’s written all over your face that you wanted to see me.”

“Why, why…?”

“Why am I here?” 

Anella nodded with difficulty. The Magic Empress of the 9th class, the Master of the Green Summit Tower, could control her own heart, and the great being known as the King of Witches, the natural enemy of mages, was somehow playing the role of a shaman in the Wind Kingdom. 

“Why, it’s fun, isn’t it?”

Unbelievable. As far as Anella knew, the King of Witches’ physical body had been sealed long ago, making it difficult for them to move directly. It was likely that this form was also a clone. Using such a difficult-to-control clone for mere amusement? That was impossible. 

“Aha, right. It’s a lie. Actually, I was being ‘guided’ here by fate. A very, very small fate, so no one would have paid attention to it, but I was interested. A boy was destined to come to this place.”

“… A boy?”

“Yeah. He’s a boy I’ve been keeping my eye on lately~ A very special boy who escaped fate. To make sure that boy would definitely come here… I needed a small variable. Hmmm, like, for example? The Persona Gate? The one you guys like.”

“Persona, Gate…?”

“Yeah. It was harder to make than I thought, right?”

Anella’s eyes widened as she stared at the girl. The witch’s smile remained annoyingly undiminished. ‘She said she created a Persona Gate…?’ That was impossible. Only special Black Mages who had directly made a pact with the Netherworld could be summoned by it and conditionally release it. Although witches were treated similarly to Black Mages, they had no direct connection to the Netherworld, so they could not open the Persona Gate. That’s how it should be… normal.

“There’s nothing you can’t do in the world, right? Even Eltman Eltwin, who was disabled from magic, became the headmaster of Stella. Aha, fate is truly funny. It's as if they're all puffed up thinking they've achieved something, when they're actually just walking the path they've already been assigned.”

Slap! Anella pushed the witch’s hand away and quickly retreated, gathering Black Magic in both hands. Her heart pounded wildly. If she took her eyes off the opponent, she felt like she would lose her head instantly, but she couldn’t help but look away. ‘What is this…? Where did all the countless people who were packed in just a moment ago disappear to? The sky was pitch black, and the clouds were still, as if they were hanging somewhere, not moving.’

“You have something interesting.”

“Ah…!” A worn, torn amulet held in the witch's hand. Anella hurriedly searched her pockets, but as always, there was nothing. ‘When did…?’ The witch flicked the amulet back and forth, stroking her chin as she asked. 

“Who gave it to you?”

“Actually… I think I know.” I’ve never felt this kind of soul fragrance before.

Did this witch even have anything she didn’t know? Anella, feeling like all her secrets had been laid bare, gritted her teeth and persevered. 

“Why do you carry this around? Why did the boy give it to you? Hmmm, maybe you want to evolve? Or forbidden love between a mage and a Black Mage? Oh, so romantic.”

“Or maybe… you want to be human?”

Anella’s brow twitched, and the witch burst into laughter. 

“Ahaha! That’s so funny. Do you really think something like that is possible?”

“… Baek Yuseol said it was possible.”

“Oh, really? But what do you plan to do with it? This amulet, I mean… It’s already lost all its efficacy, it’s just a piece of scrap paper. It must have been a truly magnificent amulet not long ago.  Even I couldn’t make something with such perfect completion. But not now. It’s just trash. You’re just a fool clinging to this worthless object. Do you understand?”

“That… Baek Yuseol wouldn’t give me trash.” Anella wanted to believe that, but was there any truth to the witch’s words? Who should she believe?

“You really didn’t know, looking at your face. But it’s not like there’s no way.” The witch blew a breath towards the amulet. The amulet then absorbed a white light, and an unknown script gradually began to come to life. 

“Now, prove your foolish belief.”

Swish- The amulet flew past Anella’s cheek and soared towards somewhere in the city. 

“A, no…!” Anella tried to reach out, but the amulet was already gone, far away. But she couldn't give up on the amulet, so she jumped from the fortress and used all her Black Magic to chase it, running at full speed. The witch watched her from behind, her lips curling up. 

‘A Black Mage’s humanization… There has never been a case like that. Black Mages were created when human souls were corrupted by the Netherworld, but there was no way in this world to purify them. But Baek Yuseol is experimenting with Anella. Experiment? No, it's a conviction. ‘That… is an ancient artifact.’ Just seeing that she entrusted such a precious item to Anella’s care was enough to tell. Baek Yuseol must have given her that item, convinced that she would turn Anella back into a human. Black Mages cannot return to being human. That is also written fate. But if Baek Yuseol wants to defy it… ‘It’ll be fun to watch.’

As soon as we entered the gate, the Talking Magpie Glasses instantly analyzed the internal situation and gave us a briefing. I carefully observed my surroundings, saving every detail in the glasses. This Persona Gate was a place I had never been to while playing the original game, so I needed a thorough analysis through the glasses. Although the Persona Gate of 3 Risks wasn’t truly that dangerous, Hong Biyeon and Bandiyeon were both 4th class mages, and I also possessed abilities equal to theirs, it was necessary to be careful because you never know when or where something might happen. 

“Don’t relax, stay alert.” Bandiyeon carefully advanced, her long staff pointed forward.

“… It’s normal.” That was one student’s comment. True, it was quite ordinary for a gate’s interior. The scene they saw just before entering was playing out exactly as it was. 

“The background… is it the Wind Kingdom?”

The streets of the Wind Kingdom. The buildings of the Wind Kingdom. The roads of the Wind Kingdom. The only difference was that the sky was pitch black, making everything dark, and there was not a single person present. The fact that the street, which had been bustling with people just moments ago, was empty, felt quite desolate and chilling. 

“Do the analysis yourselves, we won’t interfere.”

This was the practical training ground for the 1st year students. As 2nd year students, Bandiyeon and Ryudelic would only offer them some assistance, the practical training was entirely up to the 1st years.

“I’ll calculate the background limit.”

“Okay. Then I’ll trace the route and figure out the story.”

Persona analysis was very difficult to do with individual strength, so cooperation between each other was essential.

“Go, Princess? What will you do?”

“I’ll do it myself.” … Of course, there are exceptions everywhere.

“Hey. We came here as a team, so let’s do it together.” When I casually chimed in, Hong Biyeon’s expression crumpled. She was probably extremely upset about being told to collaborate with insignificant people when she could do it herself.

“… Just this once.”

“Oh? Oh, okay.” She allowed it so readily that I was a little surprised. ‘Then I will too…’ With the capabilities of my Talking Magpie Glasses, I could analyze everything in this gate, even find the location of the bathroom, but since this was practical training, I intended to work alongside the other students. I wasn’t the type who liked to stand out, anyway. 

Silently, I processed only the parts the other students asked for, pooling our heads together to squeeze out the results of the analysis, when a small message popped up on the bottom of the Talking Magpie Glasses.

“…Huh?” What’s this nonsense all of a sudden?

“What’s wrong? Any problems?”

“No. Nothing. And, that formula’s backwards.”

“Oh? Thanks.” I avoided the student who showed interest in my reaction and focused on the Talking Magpie Glasses. ‘What’s going on?’ The Commanding Spirit’s Amulet had already served its purpose, but it was an item with the potential to be revived.  Although it was completely destroyed when I saved Full Flame, it was a relic-level item after all. I had broken it in half and given it to Anella. Although its efficacy had worn off, its ability to accumulate ‘belief’ remained. The power of belief was useless to me, but I judged that it would be much more helpful if it blossomed in Anella’s hands, who was destined to become human someday, and I gave it to her as a gift…. ‘It suddenly recharged?’ It’s much faster than I expected. No, I had initially thought of the Commanding Spirit’s Amulet as merely a support role for humanization. With current technology, I thought restoration was impossible. ‘Why did it recharge?’ 

More importantly, there was something I had been wondering about since before. We are currently inside the Persona Gate, completely cut off from the outside world. Even with the Talking Magpie Glasses, it should be impossible for them to bring in news from another world. ‘How did it figure out that the amulet had recharged? Could you have also become capable of interdimensional communication?’ ‘Then what?’ *… What? Here? I was dumbfounded at those words. The amulet I had given to Anella had inexplicably been confirmed inside the Persona Gate, and it had even been recharged.  ‘What in the world is going on…?’ 

Something I didn’t know was happening somewhere.
