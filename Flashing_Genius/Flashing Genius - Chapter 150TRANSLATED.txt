Magic School Front Blink Genius Chapter 150: Magic Survival (2)

In the end, the match had begun.

"Ah..."

Seeing Baek Yuseol, who had been standing far away, teleport onto the stage and disappear, Annella relaxed her body. The guards who had been blocking her entrance frowned deeply.

"Student, if you keep this up, we won't be able to let it slide. Please step back."

"...Yes."

It was already too late. Once the match started, the participants were moved to a completely isolated new space, making it impossible to send any messages. In the past, incidents had occurred where sponsors secretly provided information or interfered with magic during the Magic Survival, so Eltman Eltwin had made the extreme choice of creating an isolated space. The stage was entirely fictional, so there was no risk of getting hurt from each other's attacks, making it even safer. Eltman's choice was considered correct, but...

'Foolish magicians.'

They couldn't even detect the infiltration of a mere dark mage, so what was so great about them? A 9th-class magician? Such a title was worthless. Annella gritted her teeth and turned around. She had to inform others about this somehow, but who would believe her? Even if they did, stopping the match would require Eltman Eltwin's power...

Would the principal of Stella move for the story of a mere exchange student? That would be absurd.

'Besides... they said it couldn't be easily stopped.'

It would take considerable casting time to retrieve the students from the isolated space. So, she had to inform them as soon as possible, but was there any way? While Annella was pondering with a dark expression, someone quickly approached her.

"Hey, look at me for a moment."

"Huh?"

Turning her head, she saw a young girl who looked like a middle school student. The girl was so cute and pretty that Annella was momentarily lost in admiration, despite the girl's frowning face.

"What are you spacing out for? You were desperately looking for Baek Yuseol earlier... What's your purpose?"

Annella instinctively checked the girl's name tag.

'Flame.'

No wonder she looked familiar; she was famous. Flame stared at Annella's face, then her twin-tail hairstyle and name tag, and her expression hardened.

'Annella...?'

She had heard the name but couldn't quite remember. Flame had stored all the content of the original novel in her head with her excellent memory, so it took her a moment to recall.

'Ah, right.'

But she quickly remembered. Flame recalled that the person named Annella in front of her was a character who intervened to break up the relationship between Eisel and Mayuseong in the original novel. Although she was a one-time extra character, Flame, who supported the coupling of Mayuseong and Eisel, remembered all the villains who interfered with them.

'She was known to be a dark mage, but why is she here...?'

While Flame was pondering, Annella grabbed her shoulder first.

"You're close to Baek Yuseol, right? I heard rumors. You used to be lovers."

"Uh, yeah. That's... right?"

Only then could Annella smile brightly. Flame, being a special student at Stella, would surely have some influence.

"Help me. Baek Yuseol might be in danger."

Annella, feeling desperate, asked the much younger human magician for help.

Whoosh...

A chilly wind blew. It felt like the scent of grass. When she opened her eyes, a green horizon filled her view. A vast meadow. The tall weeds, as high as her waist, obstructed her view. Looking up at the sky, which had darkened slightly, she saw clouds briefly passing over the sun. A space more realistic than reality. However, this place was just the virtual reality of the Stella Dome, not real.

"Hiss."

After taking a deep breath, the first thing she did was check the 'map.' In the survival game, participants could check their location on the map in real-time. If a tracking spell was attached to an enemy or a special event occurred, it would be marked on the map, so it was good to check it often.

'Starting at the very edge, huh.'

The basic rule of Magic Survival was similar to the battle royale games enjoyed on Earth. The barrier gradually narrowed from the edges in a circular shape, limiting the game area. If exposed outside the barrier for a long time, 'life points' would gradually evaporate. If life points reached zero due to combat or exposure outside the barrier, it would be considered a death, and the participant would be eliminated and expelled. Therefore, participants had to keep moving according to the game area, and it was advantageous to occupy the center of the game area due to the nature of battle royale games. Of course... the problem was that no one knew where the game area would narrow down to in the end.

'To win in a battle royale, you have to endure.'

When playing such games on Earth, she enjoyed going to the most populated areas and engaging in fierce battles, often getting eliminated quickly. But in a real competition, she couldn't do that. She had to be as strategic as possible and avoid conflicts with others. Meanwhile, it would be good to acquire special 'artifacts' scattered throughout the stage. In Magic Survival, participants could only wear the most basic staff and light robe, so artifact farming was essential for proper combat. In my case... since I couldn't use the Terrifon Sword, I had to find a very special artifact. Fortunately, I could identify the artifact supply route for this match through my glasses.

...Damn it. I ended up in the hardest location for farming. After checking the strategy, I followed the compass and headed south. In the distance, I saw a small village. Although it was set as an abandoned village with no inhabitants, I had to be careful as I might encounter other enemies.

'I need to farm quickly and move to the center.'

The most important thing now was to somehow resolve this situation, which had turned into the main episode. The main villain of this episode was a dark mage disguised as a participant, who could inflict real damage on others even in this virtual space. My location was in the northeast, so the distance was too far. By the time I reached there, Berankal would have already secured artifacts, making it likely that I would lose in a fight.

[If you respawn far from Berankal... try to head towards the central city.]

[Berankal likes to roam densely populated cities and hunt enemies who show openings right after a battle.]

[Although his combat ability itself is poor, he has enough power to silence an enemy in one strike, so be cautious.]

"Sigh..."

I read the strategy slowly, but all I could do was sigh. The distance was far, and since I had no combat power without a magic sword, there were many essential items I had to obtain immediately.

[But there is a way to hinder and lure Berankal as quickly as possible.]

[First, obtain the artifact 'Scanning Field.']

[Second, implement the 'Lu Bu Meta' strategy.]

A word I hated terribly appeared. Named after the general 'Lu Bu' from the late Han Dynasty in China, this strategy involved rushing into the most populated areas and attacking everyone indiscriminately. This was completely opposite to my original 'endure as much as possible' strategy for winning and significantly reduced the chances of winning the match. Why? Because if I scored a kill, my location would be exposed to all participants for one minute. Directly killing an enemy would earn points and allow me to loot artifacts, but the penalty was enormous. Yet, I had to repeat this to lure the dark mage.

"Sigh..."

It was overwhelming.

* * *

Southwest of the stage. In the middle of a mountain ridge so densely covered with green trees that the sky was invisible.

Thud!!

Berankal stomped on the girl lying in front of him.

"Ah, it hurts..."

The girl, wearing the uniform of the prestigious Deichel High School, reached out her hand pitifully but couldn't grasp anything.

"Deichel is nothing special."

He sneered. She had let her guard down, thinking it was just a 'game' in virtual reality. The girl's strategy was excellent. She had planned to take some of the enemy's attacks, sacrificing some life points to prepare a bigger attack. However, she couldn't have expected it. That she would feel real pain from the attacks she accepted.

'Why... why do I feel pain?'

She couldn't understand, but the dark red flames clinging to her body paralyzed her thoughts.

Whoosh!

"Ahhh!!"

"Hahaha."

It was fun. It was enjoyable. There was nothing more delightful than thoroughly trampling and destroying a student from a prestigious school who was originally better and more talented than him. Even if he let her go, she might never be able to participate in a magic battle again due to the trauma. No, it was better to kill her cleanly. It was more enjoyable that way. Once he decided, he acted immediately. Berankal brought his finger to the girl's head. He thought it wouldn't be bad to burn her from the head.

But at that moment.

Flash...!

"...What?"

A beam of light poured down from the sky, illuminating the entire mountain ridge. Having studied 'survival artifacts' in advance, he immediately recognized what it was.

"Scanning Field...?"

There were only about five of these in a match, making them hard to obtain, but they were a powerful item that could scan a designated field. The downside was that one minute after scanning, the target's location would be revealed, and not only the user but everyone in the stage could see the scanned target's location.

'Damn it!'

Why, who, here, suddenly used a Scanning Field? He had to leave within a minute. If the girl died abnormally and was eliminated, it would reveal that he could commit real murder in the stage. Not yet. If the participants in the stage noticed his presence, all their firepower would be concentrated on him.

Thud!

Berankal quickly dashed out of the scanning range, realizing he hadn't finished off the girl. But there was no choice.

'Damn it... The Scanning Field has messed things up from the start.'

'Whoever used it... don't get eliminated and wait.'

He vowed to burn them to ashes. Berankal disappeared with that firm resolve.

Flash!

One minute later, the Scanning Field illuminated the mountain ridge, but nothing was caught. Only a mysterious girl standing still without moving was detected.
