# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 212: Old Story (8)

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The terrain shook incessantly. However, the chess pieces on the board remained steadfast, never moving unless commanded by the conductor. Playing chess while the dungeon was collapsing was a daunting task. But for a mage who always cast spells in the midst of battle, it was a familiar and natural thing to do.

Of course, not for me.

"Argh!"

I planted my sword into the ground, using the blessing of the Bronze Twelve Moons to freeze the ground and my feet, anchoring myself. Then, I used the blessing of the Spring of the Red Lotus to calm my heart and take in the entire chess situation. It wasn't difficult. The calculations were being handled by the AI in my glasses. All I had to do was endure and not get swept away in the collapsing dungeon.

"Faster, faster!"

My mental strength was draining rapidly. To utilize the AI function of my glasses, I had to expend a large amount of my mental power. Thinking back to when I faced a mere high school student and felt like my head was going to explode... How much more painful would it be to defeat Karmenset? Fortunately, unlike back then, I had the blessing of the Spring of the Red Lotus, but the situation was so dire that my mental power was leaking like water from multiple directions, making my head throb as if it would burst.

Regardless, the AI in my glasses projected a holographic beam visible only to me, indicating the next move. I made the move as instructed without any mistakes.

"Ugh, what's happening now? Am I winning? Is Karmenset smarter than the AI? It's not impossible since Lee Sedol defeated AlphaGo!"

In such an extreme situation, all sorts of thoughts crossed my mind. But my worries were unfounded.

"Impressive."

"...What?"

"To think of the best move without losing your composure in this situation. Even though I don't have a physical body to be affected by the chaos, if I were in your situation, I wouldn't have been able to make such a move."

Startled by Karmenset's sudden words, I hurriedly looked around the board. Having played a considerable amount of Soul Chess in the past, it wasn't difficult to grasp the situation even without the help of my glasses.

"This is... Checkmate. I lost."

I won. And I won perfectly. I completely overpowered Karmenset without allowing a single attack.

Boom!

"Ugh!"

As Karmenset's king fell, the vibrations intensified, as if the dungeon's roots were being uprooted. Despite the chaos, Karmenset continued speaking without any tremor in his voice.

"Make your wish. The time has come."

I carefully chose my words and spoke.

"I wish for the body of Chairman Melian, who lives an eternal life due to your wish, to be restored to its original state, and for the malignant tumor 'Azkan Claw' that is eating away at his heart to be permanently stopped."

"...Your wish is quite long?"

"You can do this much, right? After all, I'm better at chess than you."

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The dungeon was collapsing, and small holes were starting to appear in the space around us. Seeing the horrifying sight of small black holes forming and swallowing the terrain into another dimension, cold sweat ran down my back.

"Heh, you're right."

He laughed heartily, as if something amused him.

"Cursed by the Silver Eleven Moons, I've been trapped in this dungeon, playing Soul Chess alone for hundreds of years. I've never refused a challenger, nor have I ever captured a fleeing one."

I didn't understand why Karmenset's words were getting longer. But somehow, they felt sincere.

"And today, this was the most enjoyable chess game I've ever had. If there's another chance, I'd like to play chess with you again!"

With those words, Karmenset's red eyes flashed, and he disappeared somewhere. He must have moved to 'another time.' As the dungeon collapsed, it would follow Karmenset, and getting swept away would likely result in a tragic death.

But I had one last resort.

"Silver Eleven Moons!"

I called out his name into the void.

"I know you're watching this moment!"

Previously, I had played poker with him and promised to meet again. For an ordinary human, a 'reunion' isn't difficult. Just set a time and place and meet again. But for a time traveler, time is a very fluid and irregular existence. The Silver Eleven Moons, who equates reunion with a miracle, must be watching me in a special way.

"Just once is enough!"

Wooong!

I could no longer hear the sound of the dungeon collapsing. Only the unpleasant white noise, like a smartphone vibrating harshly under a blanket, filled my ears. My body was also slowly being sucked into the cracks of space-time. Even as I felt myself disappearing, I called out to the Silver Eleven Moons.

"So, turn back the 'Clockwork of Time.'"

My consciousness faded.

**...Hmm!**

The Silver Eleven Moons, who had been playing Go alone, felt his senses sharpen and looked up. His silver eyes captured the image of Baek Yuseol. A terrible disaster was unfolding in real-time.

"Damn... I wasn't always watching him, so I couldn't immediately understand why that brilliant boy got caught in the vortex of space-time. I just thought, 'He got involved in a bizarre incident while I took my eyes off him for a moment...!'"

What kind of person experiences situations that even the Silver Eleven Moons would find difficult, at the age of seventeen? That wasn't important. The word 'Clockwork of Time' that Baek Yuseol shouted at the end was imprinted in his mind. He had asked for 'time travel.'

Without the blessing of the Silver Eleven Moons, the side effects would be severe, but for Baek Yuseol, who had lived through countless times... he might be safe. However, there was a problem.

"...With my current power, it's impossible to pull Baek Yuseol out of that vortex completely."

If he had absorbed the relics of the past, it might be different, but his power to manipulate time was very weak. Then, a sudden thought occurred to him.

"Wait... I can sense it. Somewhere at this moment, a 'relic of the past' is active."

It was another version of himself, and its power was his own. "I can use it."

Borrowing the power that was originally his to forcefully fit into that gap was a pitiful sight, but it was something he had brought upon himself. The Silver Eleven Moons sat cross-legged and focused his mind.

"The time the relic of the past is observing is ten years ago on the continent of Aether."

Although he couldn't bring Baek Yuseol to the present, he could temporarily settle him there and gather his strength to bring him back. It was better to stay in the past for a while than to be swept away by the vortex of time.

"Hoo..."

It had been a long time since he had turned back the Clockwork of Time, so he was a bit nervous, but he calmly used his power and spoke.

"Baek Yuseol, can you hear me?"

He didn't know if it would reach him, who was already swept away by the vortex of space-time, but he had to convey it.

"I will send you to the past, ten years ago. But remember this."

The most important advice for a time traveler.

"Never try to change events in the past. The future will be completely erased if you do... For example, the modern Aether World was built by the 'Third Magic War' that occurred a hundred years ago. If a time traveler suddenly goes back a hundred years and stops the Third Magic War, what happens to the present? Does it suddenly become another world where the war never happened? No. The current world... will disappear. Everyone's memories, will, history, civilization, family, friends, and connections. Everything will be completely 'nonexistent.'"

"You were able to defy the fate of time. Something even I couldn't do. But you must never change the fate of the past! Absolutely, absolutely! Remember this!"

He shouted desperately to Baek Yuseol, and then...

Flash!

The silver clockwork filled the night sky, rewinding exactly 3,650 times before disappearing.

"Hoo..."

Confirming that Baek Yuseol's presence had completely vanished, the Silver Eleven Moons wiped his sweat and stood up.

"Please, let nothing happen..."

Angel and Flame searched the ruined city of Karakornia in a different direction from the other exploration team members. In fact, it wasn't much of a search, as their exploration was quite clumsy. Experts could easily deduce the level of technology, dietary habits, and culture of the people at the time from small stone fragments or traces on buildings. Based on that information, they quickly identified where the 'important things' were hidden and began their investigation.

In contrast, Flame and Angel had no knowledge of relic exploration. They were magic warrior cadets who fought against dark mages. They might have some camping experience, but they were complete novices when it came to relic sites. Here, they were just ordinary people who could use a bit of magic.

"But not only experts do the exploring."

Flame recalled a scene from a movie she had seen in her previous life... or rather, in her 'past life.' The story began with a legendary treasure that countless experts and brave men couldn't find, but an ordinary heroine stumbled upon it and gained superpowers.

Just because you're ordinary doesn't mean you can't do anything. Although it was a movie and fiction, Angel herself was a special existence that was no different from fiction.

It wasn't that her existence was fiction. It was that she was very special.

"Angel, you're the protagonist."

Flame followed her slowly. Unfortunately, she didn't have the special power to follow fate, but Angel did. And as expected, Angel was gradually moving towards the answer. Even though she was wandering aimlessly in Karakornia...

The inexplicable sense of unease was getting closer and closer.

And finally, they reached the place.

"...It's a tower."

"Yeah. It was hard to find because it was tangled like a maze, but we finally made it."

It was a place she had read about in Stella's underground library. Although it looked a bit different from the records, the overall features were very similar. Angel and Flame stood in front of the towering tower and looked at each other.

"...Shall we go in?"

"Y-yes."

It would be a lie to say they weren't nervous. Angel took a deep breath and reached out to the tower's main door. Now, all she had to do was push it open...

"Hello?"

"Huh?"

"What?"

...Or so they thought, but they were already inside the tower.

"W-what's going on?"

Flame hurriedly looked around. Three cups of warm coffee. Red carpet and red curtains. The warmth of the crackling fireplace filled the room, and a cool breeze gently blew in through the open glass windows.

"Why are you so surprised?"

And in that room, there was Kyla. She had taken off her adventurer's outfit and was wearing an elegant dress, approaching the girls like a princess.

"My darlings, aren't you tired from your adventure? I'm really tired. How about we have some refreshments?"

Angel and Flame looked at her warily and took a step back, raising their staffs.

"Oh my, we were friends, weren't we? Do you hate me now?"

"...Who are you?"

Kyla smiled brightly at Angel's question.

"Well, I'm curious about my identity too. I don't have any memories of my childhood."

"No memories?"

"Yes. I just found out I had this ability at some point."

She took out a rotten apple from her bosom and stroked it with her palm. It turned into a fresh apple with a red hue. Crunch! Kyla took a bite and shivered with delight.

"Mmm! Delicious!"

"...What kind of magic is that?"

"Magic? No, it's not magic."

Kyla quietly looked at the apple she had restored. Her blank eyes made it impossible to read her thoughts, doubling the tension.

"Well, it's not magic. I don't really know."

"I see..."

How much should they believe? How much should they accept?

"Anyway, why don't you sit down? I have no ill feelings towards you. Really."

Angel and Flame exchanged glances. Since they had been brought here, there was no way to escape. As the girls nodded reluctantly, they suddenly found themselves seated in chairs.

"Now, shall we talk? Actually, the phrase 'shall we talk' feels very awkward. What should we talk about? Is there any meaning in such a conversation?"

"Judging by your expressions, I can tell this kind of talk is boring. Let's change the subject. Why did you come to find me?"

Angel's eyes widened at her words.

"As you might guess, I probably am the 'relic of the Silver Eleven Moons.' It's a conclusion I reached after contemplating my existence over many years. What do you think?"

Not knowing her own identity. No, to think that a relic... was a person. A person living among people, living an ordinary life. Angel wanted to deny the existence in front of her. It felt like her common sense was being completely overturned. But in the end...

"I think you're right."

When faced with an extraordinary situation, all she could do was accept it. Denying common sense was terrifying and painful. It might be even more so for Angel, who believed only in her own wisdom.

"Why would you seek me out? I don't know much about you. But... I felt a very familiar and friendly aura from you, so I came to find you."

"Huh? Wait..."

"What?"

Angel wasn't the only one surprised.

"Sister, did you just say 'you guys'?"

"Did you misspeak?"

"No. I felt a similar aura from you too. I don't know what it is with my limited knowledge, but... I approached because I thought it was a good scent. Why? Is something wrong?"

"No, it's not that. It's just... that aura should only be felt from 'protagonist Angel.'"

'What's going on...?'

Why did she feel a similar aura to Angel? Flame couldn't understand her words.

"...Enough of this meaningless talk. I'll get straight to the point."

Angel looked directly into Kyla's eyes. Her eyes were like clear silver jewels, beautiful.

"Show me the past from ten years ago."

Her firm words carried a certain power and determination. A determination to uncover the truth about her father, no matter the means.

Kyla looked directly at Angel. It was only a few seconds, but it felt like a long time had passed.

"Okay. I'll do it."

She smiled brightly and answered.

"I can do that much. But... you can't interfere with anything in that time."

Kyla stood up and stretched.

"Remember, you're just watching a 'recorded video tape.' Time travel is impossible even for me."

"Even the relic of the Silver Eleven Moons can't time travel?"

"Well, sometimes the ability to time travel activates without me knowing, but I don't know the principle, and I don't want to use such an incomplete ability on you."

"I see..."

"Anyway, you can't interfere with the people of that time or get involved in history. You can only watch."

Kyla emphasized that sentence several times.

'You can see the past, but you can't do anything.'

As if she already knew what Angel wanted to see in the past.

"Still, will you go?"

It didn't matter. Whatever truth awaited there, she had already decided to see it. Angel nodded firmly, and Kyla smiled bitterly.

"Alright. I'll send you to the world of ten years ago. Go and see the truth you've believed in."

At that moment, the world flickered.
