# Became a Genius in Front of the Magic School

## Chapter 262: Noble Soul (12)

Dots, curves, and runes. Spells and magic circles control the flow of mana that permeates all things in nature, creating the phenomenon known as magic. Typically, a magician must use spells and magic circles to harness and shape magic. It is common knowledge that controlling the flow of mana through spells and then forming magic through magic circles is essential.

However, a very small number of magicians break this common sense. Whether they inherited a special bloodline, possess unique traits, or have reached the 9th class of magic.

"Reverse."

Kugugugung-!!!

Alyumun. At his low utterance, the ground flipped over and soared into the sky. Soon, Kkotseorin reached out her hand into the air, and the branches of the World Tree grew thickly from the ground, supporting the land.

"Oh, oh..."

Cheolribeon watched their extraordinary actions with slightly surprised eyes. Indeed, he wondered how they would fight without harming ordinary people within the World Tree... but to think they would lift the entire ground and move it.

'Amazing...'

Alyumun, who flipped the heavy ground, and Kkotseorin, who supported and moved it with the roots of the World Tree, were both formidable monsters.

"Wow, what a great show. I can't do something like this."

"...You speak so nonchalantly despite having a blessed ability."

Everyone who knew Cheolribeon was aware that he had a contract with Damgaltowol and received the love of the earth. Therefore, Alyumun couldn't help but glare at him fiercely, but Cheolribeon was sincere.

"It's true... but no one believes me."

He only received the love of the earth; he couldn't control it. Just because he received the blessing of the Twelve Gods didn't mean he could dominate that power. This ability is literally called a 'blessing.'

"You have no idea how terrible a curse the blessing of the Twelve Gods can be."

"Ha. You say that even after contracting with Damgaltowol, which can make you invincible?"

Alyumun, who mainly trained in earth magic, was hostile towards Cheolribeon, who could handle the earth without any special training, but he was sincere.

"...Yes, invincible."

Cheolribeon muttered bitterly.

"Even when I don't want it... that's the problem."

"Nonsense."

Alyumun erased his languid expression and spread his arms. Without any preparatory movements, a brown magic circle formed and interlocked like gears, and a twisted dragon-shaped steel door fell from the sky with a thud.

Creak-!

As the steel door opened, a black giant emerged from within. The giant, over 30 meters tall, held a hammer in its right hand and an axe in its left, gleaming ominously in the sunlight, clearly made of extraordinary metal.

"Could it be... a golem made of black granite?"

Considering that it takes dozens of alchemists a year to create even a palm-sized piece of black granite, its size was truly absurd. Cheolribeon was genuinely impressed but couldn't just stand there in awe.

Wooooong!!

The black giant began to swing its axe. However, Cheolribeon didn't move. He waited quietly as the earth flipped over to create a ceiling.

Boom-!!

The giant's hammer collided with the earth's ceiling, generating an enormous shockwave that was hard to believe was mere physical force. The ground caved in, creating a crater dozens of meters in diameter, but at its center, Cheolribeon stood unscathed.

However, Cheolribeon could definitely feel it. The supposedly invincible earth shield was cracking.

"Haha... this is no joke."

Indeed, a 9th-class magician. There was a time in the distant past when magicians opposed the Twelve Gods. Seeing the current 9th-class magicians wield such god-like power, it doesn't seem like a lie.

Shiver!

"..Huh?"

While staring at the black giant, Cheolribeon felt a chilling sensation and deployed his mana at full power. The earth, absorbing his mana, formed layers of earth armor, and immediately after...

Sssss-!!

With a bizarre noise like a snake's tongue, the earth armor melted away completely.

'Crazy...!'

Rolling quickly to the ground and leaping back, Cheolribeon finally identified the magic targeting him.

"Sunlight...?"

A branch extending from the World Tree high in the sky created a transparent droplet like a magnifying glass, and as the sunlight passed through it, it turned into a laser that shot down to the ground.

"What a monstrous..."

Kkotseorin, who was controlling the World Tree with her hand raised high, stared coldly at Cheolribeon. A woman with a mysterious and beautiful appearance that could shake one's heart just by looking at her.

"Despite her looks, she's quite ruthless..."

Saaaak!

As Kkotseorin spread her arms wide, the branches of the World Tree coiled like snakes and split to the sides. Soon, green mana gathered from the branches of the World Tree, which spread like a fan covering the sky.

'Indeed, it seems I can't recklessly use that sunlight attack.'

Even a 9th-class magician would overturn a country in the time it takes to cook ramen if they recklessly used such an attack.

Rumble!

The ground shook as the roots of the World Tree rose, and suddenly, a volcano erupted, spewing lava. It was literally a natural disaster.

However, even as Alyumun and Kkotseorin's full-scale attack began, Cheolribeon remained calm.

"Haha... you still don't understand me."

Beneath his feet, a breath stirred. 'Damgaltowol,' sensing Cheolribeon's threat, awakened. It loved Cheolribeon so much that it would never forgive the source of the danger, even if the opponent were a god.

'Must someone die because of me again?'

He didn't misunderstand them. Cheolribeon was a dark magician and a slaughterer. But he had never killed innocent people without reason. However, his ability, the blessing of Damgaltowol, wanted to nullify any threat that reached him. Because of that excessive desire, countless children, the elderly, women, young men, houses, villages, and countries collapsed.

He is a villain. Regardless of the reason, wherever he went, disasters followed, and massive casualties occurred. He wanted to die at their hands. Or perhaps... he should have died completely the day he sought out the Dark Magic King to commit suicide.

But he couldn't die. Because he was a coward. So today, he creates another victim. Because he is loved by the earth, he cannot be loved by anyone.

* * *

Meanwhile, in the Garden of Yiphanell.

Baek Yuseol looked at the still-frozen Yiphanell after sending Soya away. He had roughly guessed, but seeing the reason for her fall firsthand made his heart ache.

'She chose to fall herself.'

Soya's ability wasn't recorded in the direct vision glasses, but at least he could find out that she was a 'half-witch.'

'A doppelganger...'

That was no ordinary doppelganger. Unlike in comics where a doppelganger appears out of thin air, there had to be a 'doll' that became the doppelganger's body. The caster imbues the doll with their soul and mana, and the value of the doppelganger varies depending on the grade of the doll. From low-grade wooden dolls to high-grade... living humans are often used as materials. To give consciousness to a conscious human, the caster must 'contaminate' the other with their energy.

In other words, it means extracting all the blood and mana from a living person and filling it with their own.

"Disgusting woman."

The reason the woman who stole Yiphanell's heart returned here was not just to absorb the heart. She planned to corrupt Yiphanell with her energy and turn her into a doll. But who was Yiphanell? Despite her childlike speech and appearance, she was a spirit who had lived for a thousand years. Even though she lost all her energy, she didn't lose her wisdom and chose to fall herself to avoid being corrupted by Soya.

...Even giving up the 'noble soul' she had built up over hundreds of years to become a spirit.

His fists clenched involuntarily. The more he thought about it, the more he felt sorry for Yiphanell and wanted to kill Soya.

'But I mustn't.'

He must not be consumed by anger. A simple death wouldn't be a proper punishment. She needed to be given a pain worse than death. To make her regret daring to touch Yiphanell's heart.

"Just wait a little. I'll get you out of here soon."

Yiphanell had lived too long, bound to this garden. After losing her heart, she became too weak to adapt to the outside environment. But now that she had completely fallen... it might be possible to purify her soul again and take her outside.

'That woman must have headed for Cheolribeon.'

The emotion he saw in her last moment was none other than 'desire.' He clearly felt her intense desire to cut off Cheolribeon's head and fully absorb the spirit's heart.

How grateful he was for the blessing of Yeonheungchunsamwol. Thanks to his certainty, he could move strategically.

'More importantly... purification is the biggest problem.'

He couldn't ignore the immediate important issue in front of him, blinded by anger. If Yiphanell had fallen herself, restoring her to her original state would be extremely difficult. In the original game, unless she hadn't fallen at all, there were almost no episodes of restoring her once she had fallen, making it even more troublesome.

'The only hope...'

The only girl in the world who could restore a fallen dark magician, Puleim, but he wasn't sure if she could handle this situation. If it were a forced fall, it might be possible, but Yiphanell had fallen of her own will.

"Hoo... I don't know. Just wait a little longer. I'll be back soon after dealing with Soya."

With a worried expression, Baek Yuseol gently touched the purple barrier surrounding Yiphanell and then stepped out of the garden.

In the moonlit garden, now empty of everyone.

Srrrk...

The fallen spirit slowly opened her eyes. Although the air was contaminated by dark magic, her eyes were clear and pure, still worthy of being called a 'spirit.'

She remembered Baek Yuseol's back. The back that seemed to carry a heavy burden. The back that overcame everything and moved forward.

'I'll be back soon...'

Yiphanell desperately tried to convey her thoughts to Baek Yuseol, but it was useless. However, it didn't matter if he didn't hear. They would meet again.
