# I Became a Genius in Front of the Magic School

## Chapter 180: Unreal (4)

Dudududu!!

An attack helicopter flew across the skies of Incheon City. The ground below was half-destroyed and burning, and a monster roared from amidst the flames.

-Kuoooo!!

A shockwave burst out, shaking the helicopter, but the crew was not afraid. They knew there was someone who would protect them.

-Point. Deploy Code Magician.

The one facing the monster was not a fighter jet, a tank, or a missile. It was just an ordinary girl. A high school girl named Flame jumped out of the slowly descending helicopter and swung her staff.

Flash!

-Oh, that's magic...

-It's my first time seeing it in person, but as expected.

-Amazing.

The clash of light and the monster. As the spear of light from the magic circle in the air pierced the monster, it retaliated by spewing flames in all directions.

-Oh no!

The helicopter hurriedly performed evasive maneuvers, but Flame did not dodge. She stood still, raising her staff high into the sky, with a wall of light in front of her.

Flash!

A massive pillar of light pierced through the dark clouds and sliced the monster's neck.

Boom...!!

-Oh!

-She did it!

-Flame killed another monster!

Monsters had special barriers on their skin that made them impervious to missiles and bullets, making them difficult to deal with. But for Flame, it was a breeze. The arrows of light she shot easily penetrated the monster's skin, and no monster could resist the blade of light.

"Phew..."

Having successfully completed another hunt, Flame turned around and waved at the sky with a smile. It was a fan service for the countless drone cameras filming her from somewhere. She couldn't hear it, but she could feel it. The enthusiastic cheers of her fans. She was the only magician on Earth and their savior. Such treatment was only natural.

* * *

Click! Click! Shutter sounds!

"Flame! You successfully hunted another monster. Can you share your thoughts?"

"Is it difficult to balance your studies and hero activities?"

"The principal of Chilwol High School officially praised you. Can you respond to that?"

On her way back in the helicopter, numerous reporters had already gathered at the landing site, thrusting cameras and microphones at her. Flame answered their questions one by one. It was a bit tiring, but not difficult. Besides, it made her fans even happier.

"Studies..."

She didn't want to give up, but she ended up half-giving up. As monsters began to appear all over the world, Flame had to travel around the globe. But did her grades drop? Not at all.

"How did you get first place with no time? I studied mainly from textbooks."

[Love calls from prestigious universities worldwide! What will her choice be?]

Even with minimal studying, she topped the country, and prestigious foreign universities were contacting her one after another. Even without studying, getting into a prestigious university might not have been difficult. She was truly on a winning streak. Everything she touched turned to success. Whether it was studying, dancing, singing, or magic, Flame excelled. If she bought a lottery ticket, she won first place. If she donated lightly, she was praised as an angel, and the clothes and accessories she wore became trends, gaining explosive popularity worldwide.

The world was watching her. The world followed her movements and nodded in the direction she pointed. It felt like she was the center of the world. Walking a smooth path without any obstacles, could others understand this feeling? She was happy. She thought she could continue to open a bright future like this.

- Flame! Can you deploy right now?

One day, during class, Flame received a call and hurriedly left school. Managed by the government, skipping classes had become routine, but she could still maintain minimal studies. Recently, monster appearances had become more frequent.

- Monsters have appeared simultaneously in Cheorwon, Gangwon Province, and Okinawa, Japan. We plan to handle the monster in Gangwon first and then move to Japan. If we're late, we might have to use missiles.

"Ah... simultaneous monster appearances? This has never happened before. 'Missiles are not an option.' Okinawa, Japan, is a famous tourist destination with a large floating population. Using missiles would mean considering the city's destruction, so it should be the last resort. Moreover, it was uncertain if missiles could definitely defeat the monster, so they had to hurry.

"Please hurry."

Flame decided to take her mission seriously. If not her, who would save the people of Earth? People needed her. But things didn't always go as planned.

Boom!

"Flame! Are you okay?"

"I'm fine!"

A 15-meter-tall monster with red skin and a single eye. This was the second monster she encountered after defeating the one in Cheorwon, Gangwon Province. The unique feature was that it fired lasers from its eye.

'It's too strong!'

Having been active as a magician for half a year, Flame was starting to realize that her magic wasn't growing at all. It was only natural.

'I don't even know where or how I learned magic.'

The knowledge of magic suddenly imprinted in her mind, and she used it as if it were her own. But growing beyond that was impossible. She objectively assessed her level as 'Stage 4.' The monsters that had appeared so far were at most Stage 2 or 3. They weren't difficult to deal with until now.

Zing!

Boom!

"Ugh!"

She dodged the violently exploding laser, and the debris from the building behind her poured down. 'At least Stage 5...! This level of destructive power is something even I can't easily produce.' Fortunately, the giant monster couldn't control its massive body well, so its mobility was low. However, the destructive power of the laser from its eye was so strong that even fighter jets couldn't approach it.

'Can I... win?'

Zing-!

Thud!

Every time the giant's gaze swept across, traces of civilization crumbled one by one. Flame could do nothing in the meantime. The destructive power was at least two stages stronger than her, and she couldn't withstand the attack with any shield she could currently deploy.

'What should I do...'

As she hesitated, gripping her staff tightly, something brushed past her ear like a feather-light breeze. When she realized it, a boy was standing in front of her, back turned. It was a familiar figure.

"Baek... Yuseol..."

He stared at the giant and then turned to Flame.

"It's my fault."

"What...?"

"Because you drew happiness too quickly, the balance of the world is messed up."

"What are you talking about...?"

"Just wait a moment."

Baek Yuseol pulled out a small, short staff, unlike hers. As mana was released from it, a white blade of light emerged.

"Wait, that won't..."

But before she could finish her sentence, Baek Yuseol soared into the sky. He teleported between buildings and soon reached the giant's vicinity.

Zing!

The giant fired a laser at Baek Yuseol, but it missed. He skillfully dodged the laser while ensuring it didn't hit the ground.

"Ah...?"

It all happened in the blink of an eye. Baek Yuseol, moving freely through the air, finally reached the giant's nape and deeply stabbed the blue spot there with his sword.

Immediately.

-Kuwooo...

The giant lost its strength and collapsed to the ground.

Boom!!!

"Ugh!"

The impact of the giant's fall was immense due to its massive size. As Flame hurriedly put up a barrier and covered herself with her arms, she heard footsteps nearby. When she quickly looked up, Baek Yuseol was looking down at her with a troubled expression. His attire was completely unruffled, as if he hadn't just fought a giant.

"How...?"

She couldn't believe that the monster she couldn't even face was defeated in a single blow.

"You could have done it too."

He said, glancing at the spot where the giant had fallen.

"It will be harder from now on. Stronger monsters will appear more frequently."

"Wait, what do you mean?"

"Exactly what I said."

Baek Yuseol remained silent for a while. He didn't disappear like the wind as before. He was waiting. Waiting for Flame to ask a question. Her mind was in turmoil. She finally met Baek Yuseol, but she didn't know what to ask.

'Who are you?'

'Are you another magician?'

'Why are you wearing our school uniform?'

Countless questions came to mind and disappeared. Finally, Flame asked this.

"...What happens now?"

He said stronger monsters would appear more frequently. Modern scientific weapons couldn't stop them. Why? She didn't know. The monster's barrier couldn't be explained by science yet.

"This world will perish."

"W-What... Are there no other magicians? Like you, or me..."

Could she even call herself a magician? Flame hesitated slightly when referring to herself, but Baek Yuseol didn't seem to mind.

"No. It's just you and me."

"That can't be..."

Flame, looking despondently at the ground, slowly opened her lips to ask.

"...Then, what should I do?"

Why did she ask him that? Why did she think Baek Yuseol had a solution to this situation? She didn't know. But her 'instinct' told her. If she asked Baek Yuseol, he could solve anything.

He hesitated for a long time. Finally, he took a step and spoke.

"You have to choose death yourself."

Whoosh...!

She looked up to ask what he meant, but Baek Yuseol had already left.

'I have to die...?'

Nonsense. If she died, who would stop the monsters? How could she give up such a happy life...?

"Ah..."

Flame sat there for a long time, unable to move.

* * *

That night, Flame had a terrible nightmare. It was so realistic and horrifying.

In the dream, Flame was a wanderer.

Swoosh-!!

Walking through the rain-soaked, ruined streets, Flame saw that civilization was now just a trace. The once brilliant and noble human technology had been destroyed by monsters, and now it was natural to live like rats, hiding for survival. It was no different for Flame.

She crossed the ruined city, probably to find food for the day, walking and walking. In the dream, she hid behind a building. A giant monster passed by the debris of a collapsed building. She held her breath, waiting for the monster to pass.

The Flame who was once the center of the world was now gone. In the dream, she was just prey for the monsters, nothing more, nothing less.

-Kuoooo!

-Kyaaak!

Monsters fought each other right next to her. The sky was occupied by winged demons, making it impossible to move freely, and the underground was filled with toxic gas, making it hard to breathe. If there was a living hell, this was it.

In the dream, she crawled between buildings, holding her breath, and found something.

[December High School]

It was her collapsed alma mater. Everyone was dead. The school was the first to fall when the monsters took over the world. And there, Baek Yuseol was sitting. He opened an umbrella, looking at the rainy sky, and spoke.

"Because you became happy too quickly... the balance of the world collapsed."

In the dream, she knew. In the dream, she blamed herself.

"Huh..."

In the dream, she cried.

"It's my fault, it's my fault."

She cried and cried endlessly.
