##  The Genius Who Became a Flash Before the Magic Academy 275 52. Practical Training (4)

The practical training for the 1st year A and S classes was conducted with the assistance of instructors. The instructors were composed of mages who had graduated from Stella Academy or were studying at Stella Graduate School, with a class rank of 4 or higher, and 2nd and 3rd year seniors. The senior instructors were assigned to accompany the 1st year freshmen on their missions. 

“Ruderick. This is the list of students you’ll be responsible for.” 

Ruderick, a 2nd year A class student. He was a top student who shone brightly at 39th place in his class.  A descendant of a noble magic family in the Wind Empire, he walked the elite course smoothly, becoming an incredibly valuable talent who received special treatment even within the nation.

‘Talent? I’m in a different league.’  While there were countless talents within the kingdom, Ruderick was a student of Stella Academy. Stella Academy admitted everyone equally, whether commoner or royalty.  Regardless of prior training or early education, Stella only judged students based on their pure magical talent and ability, making admission into the academy a title of "genius."  This was why the Wind Empire, currently fractured into numerous factions and desperate for even a single talent, had to offer tremendous favor to Stella graduates. 

His dreams weren't fulfilled yet. He wasn't just aiming to simply graduate from Stella but to reach the A class… no, the S class.  ‘This annoying instructor job is just a stepping stone to that.’ Ruderick had to accept these annoying tasks, as he needed to impress the professors, gain rewards, and earn points since he lacked connections. 

‘While I'm putting in all this effort…’ 

Ruderick pretended to read the students' names while secretly glancing to the side.

Dokcheol-gwang, a 2nd year S class student. He was a crazy man who had turned the school upside down with his brutal magic martial arts upon entering. Unlike other magic warriors, he fought by weaving magic formations around his fists and landing direct strikes. This style was difficult for ordinary students to counter, making him a constant winner in one-on-one duels.  A true genius among geniuses. 

Although Dokcheol-gwang came from a street urchin background in the Wind Empire, unable to even become a minor noble, his life completely changed the moment he was assigned to the S class in Stella.  That was the power of the S class in Stella; it granted a status superior to that of an average noble.

‘He’s from such a lowly background… And yet, he’s in the S class, the same class, no, even the class I aim for. It’s utterly galling to see him standing there so confidently.’  S class students received special care from the Stella faculty, as well as from the World Mage Tower and the Academy.  They didn’t even have to do these annoying instructor jobs.  If there was a deeper reason behind Dokcheol-gwang’s choice, Ruderick would have considered him a genius and sought to learn something from him…

“Well, this will be fun!”

Fun!  Ruderick couldn’t help but get irritated at Dokcheol-gwang, who had volunteered for the instructor job simply because he found it enjoyable.

“What’s so fun, you crazy bastard?” 

Someone slapped Dokcheol-gwang hard enough to make a ‘pak!’ sound, as he was reading the mission application with a silly grin on his face.  It was Bandiyeon, a 2nd year S class student.

“This is a real mission, so take good care of the kids. Don’t go getting in the way of the mission just for kicks.  Understand? This isn’t your job, it’s the 1st year’s job.”

“That wouldn’t be fun.”

Dokcheol-gwang’s smile faltered slightly as she glared at him. She was the only woman who could control the stubborn and reckless Dokcheol-gwang.

‘…I don’t understand why she’s stuck with that stupid, low-born bastard.’ Ruderick scowled.  Bandiyeon was from a very special family in the Wind Empire; not a noble, but worlds apart from the beggar Dokcheol-gwang.  She was a genius, a brilliant mage, with a family lineage and beauty that made her undoubtedly the most radiant among the 2nd years.  Why would she waste her time with Dokcheol-gwang, of all people? 

‘She should be with someone like…' 

He glanced at Dokcheol-gwang, only to be met with Bandiyeon's gaze.  She softened her harsh expression towards Dokcheol-gwang and waved a casual greeting.

“Oh, you’re the one who’s going to be an instructor with me at the Persona Gate, right?”

“…I’m not ‘that one,’ I’m Ruderick.”

“Yes, yes. Anyway, it’s good to see you.  Hmm? Do we know each other?”

They had to know each other. As a member of the ‘Seven Winds Families’ of the Wind Empire, Ruderick and Bandiyeon were bound to encounter each other at least once a year at the Elders' Meeting.  From the moment he saw her at the age of ten, Ruderick had remembered her, but it seemed she didn't recall him.  Despite attending the same school for a whole year, she didn't even remember his name properly.  Even if the student body was close to a thousand, and their schedules didn't overlap much, making encounters rare…

Ruderick felt it was a bit too much.

“Huu, we know each other. Ruderick of the Wind Empire. Don’t you remember?”

“Ah… Oh!  Yeah, right. Nice to see you.  You were so tiny back then, but you’ve grown up a lot.”

“I was bigger than you back then too.”

“Ah, well… Anyway, let’s work hard together this time, okay?  We got stuck with the most annoying Persona Gate, so…”

Bandiyeon sighed heavily. While it was bad luck for her, it was a stroke of good fortune for Ruderick.  It seemed she was supposed to be on the mission with Dokcheol-gwang, but the professors had separated them. Now she was stuck with Ruderick at the Persona Gate mission.  It wasn’t a particularly difficult mission, being only a 3-Risk level, suitable for the 1st year level. Ruderick, who had completely mastered the 3rd class and had plenty of real-world experience, found this mission easy.

“Wow, talk about good luck. The mission is right in the Wind Empire, of all places.  It’s been a while since I went back home. Hmm…”

Bandiyeon licked her lips with interest, scanning the student list for the mission she was assigned. 

[Baek Yuseol, 2nd year S class]

She felt a bit annoyed that her mission was separated from Dokcheol-gwang, but was it good fortune that she could carry out the mission with a child she was deeply interested in watching?  For the first time in a long time, Bandiyeon smiled faintly. 

“Well, let’s go see our kids, shall we?”

The 1st year A and S class students received different orientations depending on their assigned missions.  It was a place for mission briefings and planning tactics, and attendance was mandatory. Ruderick headed to the classroom where the 1st year students were gathering to carry out the Persona Gate mission.

“Drrr, kunk!”

Bandiyeon pushed open the door noisily and entered the classroom, glancing around briefly. Ruderick, who followed after her, confirmed the members and then stiffened his expression.

Out of about ten students, there were two who stood out.  He had already seen their names on the list, but the fact that Hong Biyeon and Baek Yuseol, two formidable freshmen, would be on the mission with him was a significant burden for Ruderick.

‘…That guy is Baek Yuseol.’

The campus was so vast that, even though he was attending the same Stella Academy, this was almost the first time Ruderick had actually seen him.  He had seen him from a distance during competitions, but actually seeing him face-to-face, and with their eyes meeting, made him feel even more ridiculous.

‘It was said that he’d roam around hunting Black Mages, making trouble, wasn’t it?’

He was undeniably great.  Ruderick had never even fought a Black Mage properly in his first year.  However, to be honest, Ruderick, back then, could have easily taken down a few Black Mages if he’d wanted to.  He just hadn’t because, as a first-year, he was still eager to learn and wanted to stay within the framework set by the professors.

‘It’s not like everyone is lazy and staying still, kid.’

Ruderick, after checking out Baek Yuseol, turned his attention to Hong Biyeon.  Contrary to the rumors of her being a spoiled princess, she was sitting properly, staring intently at him.  Considering the other arrogant 1st year S class freshmen, who were sprawled out on the floor, sleeping, or blatantly ignoring the situation, she was at least well-behaved.

“Nice to meet you. I’m Bandiyeon, a 2nd year S class student, and I’ll be accompanying you on this Persona Gate mission.  This is the 2nd year…  uh, what class is it?”

“A class.”

“Right.  A class, Yuderick.”

“It’s Ruderick.”

“Anyway, that’s not the point.”

It is.

“You’ve all done some practice with the Persona Gate, but the real thing is completely different.”

Bandiyeon’s expression hardened as she spoke. 

“The practice sessions are designed to help you figure out the right path and make things as easy as possible. But in the real Persona Gate, it will twist things up and confuse you, leading you astray.” 

No one knows why Persona Gates suddenly appear in this world.  It’s an entryway to a completely different world, a descent of beings from beyond.  Why do the Black Mages keep summoning the Persona Gates into this world? What secrets are hidden within that world?  And why do they constantly try to assimilate mages into their world?

“One thing’s for sure, the Persona Gate isn’t friendly to you. Everything in that place, the sky, the earth, the water, the air, even the very existence there, will oppose you and try to swallow you whole.”

Ruderick could hear some of the 1st year students gulp nervously.

‘Adorable little things.’

He had already conquered the Persona Gate twice, so the freshmen trying to enter for the first time seemed simply cute and naive.

“Preparing for the Persona Gate mission requires a long time, and the mission itself takes a tremendous amount of time.  It’s a 3-Risk level, the lowest level among gates, but it might take up to a week.  You all knew that when you applied for this, right?”

All the students nodded, except Baek Yuseol.

‘Damn, a week…  I want to go back to those days when I could just sit at my desk at school, with my textbook in front of me, and doze off. No, I want to study. I finally understand how comfortable and enjoyable it is to study. Why didn’t I realize it back then?  If I could go back, I could probably devour all the textbooks and become the top student.  No, that’s not possible.’

“We leave tomorrow morning at six.  A graduate instructor will be accompanying us, but they won’t be entering the Persona Gate.”

In other missions like monster hunts and dungeon explorations, veteran magic warrior instructors would quietly accompany them, keeping out of sight, but that wasn’t possible with the Persona Gate.  First of all, some Persona Gates have a limited number of people allowed to enter, and even if they could enter, everyone would be assigned a ‘role’ the moment they entered.  The instructor would also have to perform their role to avoid being devoured by the Persona Gate, but if they were too enthusiastic, they would often end up taking care of the entire mission on their own, which was unavoidable.

“We may be seniors with real-world experience, but unlike dungeons and monster hunts, we can’t handle every crisis.  We might all get separated inside, or even become enemies.  But there’s one thing for certain.”

Bandiyeon smiled with confidence.

“We are mages of Stella, and we’ve never failed, ever.  This time will be no different.”

Her words seemed to ease the tension in the 1st years, their expressions becoming slightly brighter. It was Bandiyeon’s tactic to deliberately create tension, then instill confidence to boost mission performance to 100%.

She then detailed the preparations and plans for conquering the Persona Gate, while Ruderick silently observed Baek Yuseol. 

“Haa… he seems to be listening, but he’s yawning every other second. That slacker attitude is so bad.”

‘Tch, these new students…’

Back in Ruderick’s first year, he wouldn’t have dared to look up at seniors. They’ve grown accustomed to bad habits.  Didn’t he have a fight with some idiot from the 2nd year C class at the beginning of the semester?  To begin with, it was wrong for a 1st year to fight a 2nd year, and even then, hadn’t Baek Yuseol lost?  It meant that was his true level.

‘I’ll see how he fares this time.’

Ruderick was ready to set Baek Yuseol straight, if he behaved inappropriately as a Stella student.
