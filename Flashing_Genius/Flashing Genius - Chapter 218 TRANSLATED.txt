### Chapter 218: An Old Story (14)

After finishing her meal with Isaac Morf, Baek Seolgi immediately moved to the highest-grade accommodation, reserved only for the knight commander, under the guidance of Wilhelm, the aide.

"Ah, I remember him... The stern yet kind face of Wilhelm from my childhood comes to mind. Though he was strict and scary to others, he was always warm to me... Wilhelm, the aide."

Now, Wilhelm was giving Baek Seolgi a cold and icy look.

"...This is the place."

Baek Seolgi had received special treatment from Grand Duke Isaac Morf, allowing her to use a private room, which Wilhelm seemed to disapprove of. His loyalty to Isaac was so high that he had vehemently opposed it, even raising his voice.

"Yes. It's a nice room. I'll use it well."

Regardless, Baek Seolgi responded in a calm and composed tone. It was truly annoying, but sometimes her indifference to others' opinions was enviable.

"I warn you, do not put the young lady in danger. I will not forgive you."

Wilhelm spat out coldly before disappearing. Left alone, Baek Seolgi quietly looked in the direction he had disappeared, then turned around and sighed deeply.

"Hoo..."

It was the first time Baek Seolgi, who was always composed, showed a moment of vulnerability, leaving Angel and Flame slightly bewildered. Baek Seolgi slowly staggered towards the bed, took off her mask, and collapsed onto it.

Finally, his face was revealed.

"As expected."

"Indeed."

It was undoubtedly Baek Yuseol. However, he looked no different from his appearance ten years later, as if he hadn't aged at all. What could have happened?

As Flame and Angel's minds were filled with confusion, Baek Yuseol muttered to himself.

"Time travel rules..."

At that moment, as if time had stopped, the two girls froze with wide eyes.

"What... did I just hear?"

It wasn't a difficult word, but it was hard to interpret, as if their brains weren't functioning properly.

"Time travel..."

Angel closed her eyes tightly and tried to organize her thoughts. Yes, it wasn't entirely unexpected. He was a regressor who had rewound time thousands of times... Traveling backward in time should be possible if he wished.

"Then, this man..."

"Yes. He is probably the Baek Yuseol we know from ten years in the future."

His youthful appearance and, upon closer inspection, his slightly modified uniform were still the Stella Academy uniform. He even had the first-year pocket watch of Stella hidden in his coat, along with the Terriphone on his waist.

For some reason, Baek Yuseol had returned to the past ten years ago and immersed himself in Angel's past.

"Could it be...?"

Flame thought. 'That man must remember what will happen in the future.'

Angel's story of discovering the truth about Isaac Morf using the artifact of the Silver Crescent Moon. However, after the story ends, she will undoubtedly be mentally and physically exhausted... Will Baek Yuseol just stand by and watch?

He has always tried desperately to prevent the misfortune of those around him, whether they were villains or good people. If he continues to do so, he must have taken the dangerous path of time travel to prevent even this terrible worst-case scenario that seemed impossible to stop.

"But, how?"

The outcome of this event is already determined. No matter how much Baek Yuseol tries, he cannot change the past at will. If Isaac Morf survives without betraying, Angel will be happy. But... that would completely destroy the original world.

'There's no way.'

Flame looked at Baek Yuseol with complicated eyes. He was staring blankly at the stars outside the window. What could he be thinking?

It would be great to have mind-reading abilities at times like this.

"Sigh, I don't know."

Baek Yuseol said that and then lay down sideways, closing his eyes. The night deepened.

* * *

Baek Seolgi, who had trespassed into the Morf Forest but was chosen by Isaac for saving Lady Angel, became a bodyguard knight.

"Does that man protect you a lot?"

Flame asked playfully as she watched Baek Yuseol facing the knights in the Blue Mane Knights' training ground. However, Angel shook her head with a serious expression.

"I don't remember well... We hardly had any contact after that day."

"...Really? That's strange. I thought Baek Yuseol would have kept his word."

Or, did Baek Yuseol fail, and the future was already completed that way?

"But! For a wanderer like you to take his place... His Highness may have acknowledged it, but we cannot!"

As expected, Baek Yuseol received a duel challenge from a knight. Although he initially seemed to refuse, thinking there was no need to fight, he eventually succumbed to the provocation. With his personality, he wouldn't deliberately lose while responding to a provocation...

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

"Ugh! Argh! Ack! Grr!"

Baek Yuseol unilaterally beat the opposing knight. It seemed he was venting his accumulated stress, hitting him refreshingly without even using magic.

"Is that his true strength?"

To unilaterally beat a 5th-class mage, he must have overwhelming skills. He might possess at least 6th-class, or maybe even 7th-class abilities. Or perhaps even higher.

"I don't know. No matter how many times he regressed, it doesn't seem possible to return with his original abilities..."

"Right?"

But it wasn't a problem worth deeply pondering. Baek Yuseol wasn't a villain, and the stronger he was, the better, as he was someone who ran around trying to save the world.

In the evening, as expected, Baek Yuseol was summoned by Grand Duke Isaac Morf. It was natural, as he had beaten a knight to a pulp on his first day of joining. He thought he would be scolded, but Isaac surprisingly didn't reprimand him much and brought up another topic.

"I called you because I want to take you with me for tomorrow's schedule."

Isaac handed a document to Baek Yuseol. Angel, who was secretly watching from behind, widened her eyes.

"That's...!"

The seal of the Adolevit royal family. From now on, 'that incident' was about to begin. Angel bit her lip with all her might. If she could feel pain, she might have been able to endure this moment, but in her ethereal state, she couldn't feel pain or bleed.

"Calm down. Baek Yuseol is by your father's side."

"...Yes."

Honestly, even Flame, who had infinite trust in Baek Yuseol, thought this incident was absolutely impossible. Nevertheless, she had to say that to reassure Angel.

"They claim that the demonic beast of the Morf Forest is about to awaken. It wasn't a magically incorrect statement. I was convinced. But..."

As the conversation continued, Angel's memories gradually returned.

"Wait a minute... My father's death. But where did he die?"

'Morf Forest.'

It was definitely there. In that forest, he betrayed the magical world and resisted the Adolevit royal family's magic knights, becoming a black mage and meeting his end... That's what she knew.

In other words, the destination of this past journey was just around the corner, but why couldn't she calm down?

"Angel, Angel!"

Flame grabbed Angel's trembling hand. Although she couldn't convey warmth, just having someone by her side was a great comfort, as she already knew.

"Calm down."

"...Yes. Thank you."

She looked at Baek Yuseol's back. He was wearing a mask now, so she couldn't see his expression, but he seemed to be seriously contemplating the situation.

What choice will Baek Yuseol make there? Will he watch her father's death? For the sake of the future world, that would undoubtedly be the right decision...

"Believe in him. He has always done the right thing and has never walked the wrong path. Has there ever been a time when you were unhappy because of his involvement?"

Angel shook her head.

"So, it will be the same this time. Calm down and wait quietly. Even if the truth revealed at the end of the wait is terrible."

Flame suppressed her last words and comforted Angel. She suddenly thought that her comfort might be poison, but she shook her head to dispel the thought.

"...Somehow, it will work out."

She wanted to believe that.

* * *

Morning came.

"Damn, I'm so tired."

The knights with some influence used single-person tents, and I received similar treatment, so I could sleep comfortably. Even though I didn't stand guard, the fatigue didn't go away at all.

When I opened the tent and went out, I saw the dignified knights of Morf, dressed in their uniforms, coming out of their single-person tents like me.

"Isn't this single-person tent a bit much?"

What if someone attacks at night? It seems tactically disadvantageous. The army I know had all the officers sleeping together in the central barracks.

Well, modern and noble societies can't be exactly the same.

"Kim, it's been a while."

"...Go to your position."

I casually approached a nearby knight and greeted him, but all I got in return was coldness. No one welcomed me.

It was still early in the morning, but the entire knight order gathered in the central clearing of the forest. They had been preparing for this operation for over a month. I was an uninvited guest who suddenly joined the day before the operation.

I wouldn't participate properly in the operation, and I didn't have a specific mission. I didn't know what Isaac was thinking when he asked me to join the operation.

'There must be a reason.'

He was wise.

'By the way, what happened...'

The episode of Angel's past from ten years ago wasn't properly recorded in the direct hit glasses, so I didn't know what would happen next... and what the truth was.

"From now on, we will start the departure ceremony."

Before the knight order sets out, the highest-ranking person comes out to give a speech. I don't know if it's always like this, but considering that such scenes often appear in medieval fantasy novels, it seems to be historically accurate.

The expedition leader was Isaac Morf. Although it was only on the surface, since he was the lord of this territory, they used Isaac's face. I wondered if the 'surface' had any meaning. This operation was being carried out secretly without informing the outside world, so 'is there a need for that?'

During the operation meeting, the old wizards of the Magic Association explained that it was to prevent the general public from being frightened, and they would announce it after the subjugation was successful...

It sounded plausible, but it seemed like they were trying to hide something.

The departure ceremony was short, reflecting Isaac's personality. The Morf Grand Duchy. The Adolevit royal family. The highest authorities in the magical world had gathered to hunt the single demonic beast, Baekyoho Hwaryeong.

However, the opponent was a 9-risk demonic beast.

"...At least it seems to be on par with the pirate king Black Belize we met before."

At that time, the Adolevit royal family was unprepared and was helplessly defeated, but if they had been properly prepared, they would have had a chance of winning.

Hong Si-hwa Adolevit. She was a woman who had never failed in her life, so she would surely succeed in this mission as well. In the original game, there were occasional stories of 9-risk demonic beasts being defeated, so it wasn't an impossible story.

'Baekyoho Hwaryeong is not the problem.'

Why did Isaac Morf betray the magical world and turn his back? That was the biggest problem.

...So I thought.

The elite knight order. The demonic beast Baekyoho Hwaryeong, released from its seal. They were helplessly defeated.

"Ah... The sky is filled with white flames. A shower of white flames was striking the world. The forest had already turned to ashes and disappeared, the terrain was completely overturned to the point where the map had to be greatly revised, and most of the magic knights, who were thought to be the best elite, had died and fallen to the ground.

In the midst of it all, a massive fox demonic beast with five tails roared towards the sky.

-Kiyooooo-!!!

With a single kick, it scattered despair, and with each roar, death spread like a plague. That existence was...

A disaster itself.

Only then did I vaguely realize the truth hidden in the shadows of the past.

'Hong Si-hwa's expedition forcibly unsealed Baekyoho Hwaryeong but failed to defeat it and was defeated.'

That was the true history.
