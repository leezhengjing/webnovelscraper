# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 241: The Witch (8)

Under the sky tinged with the light of dawn, Macaron Hyejin stood atop a tall building in Arcanium, squinting as she gazed down at the night view. This city was particularly famous for its beautiful nightscape, with neon signs that never turned off and floating objects that roamed the sky like satellites, continuously emitting light. These objects, known formally as the "Eyes of Paharagal," were actually magical devices created to observe everything happening in the city, ensuring Arcanium was never dark.

These devices observed the entire city 24/7 without a single moment of rest, but what was the point if they couldn't even detect the movements of a witch?

"Hmm... Captain, it seems something interesting happened," Hyejin said, narrowing her eyes. Currently, the Stella Knights were in control, and the Stella Magic Investigation Team's inspection unit was temporarily controlling part of the area, investigating something. Because of this, Hyejin and Kaen couldn't approach the area, but there was no need to. They already knew what had happened there.

"They're using the Compass of Memories? That expensive thing..." The Compass of Memories was an extremely rare artifact from ancient times, with only seven existing in the world. It had the function of recalling past events as if they were memories, but it had a very clear drawback: the cost of using it was astronomical. Even recalling a very short moment could cost as much as a country's monthly revenue, so it wasn't something to be used lightly.

However, institutions like the Stella Academy, the Kingdom of Adolevit, the Empire of Skalven, and the Tower of the Full Moon, which boasted immense wealth, used the compass whenever they wanted, as if the penalty meant nothing to them. Of course, from the perspective of the Tower of the Waning Moon, which owned two of the remaining three compasses that were currently missing, it was quite...

"Throwing money down the drain," Hyejin remarked disdainfully.

"Do they really get permission to use the Compass of Memories like that? That's amazing. Stella is Stella, or maybe they're just stupid," Kaen commented.

"The headmaster of Stella is not a foolish person. There must be a reason for granting permission," Hyejin replied.

"Well, they just seem like fools to me," Kaen retorted, but the idea of using the Compass of Memories to track the witch's movements was already pathetic enough in Hyejin's eyes. However, the fact that Baek Yuseol was involved in that place made it worth watching, so they didn't leave.

While the Stella Magic Investigation Team was investigating the scene, Baek Yuseol stood a step back, merely observing. It was impossible to guess what he was thinking.

"By the way, who killed the witch hunter? It doesn't seem like the witch did it..." Hyejin had seen a witch hunter once in her childhood. She knew well the overwhelming and terrifying power of that existence. A witch hunter couldn't be killed by the power of an ordinary witch or wizard. Having abandoned their own existence in exchange for monstrous power, witch hunters were at the top of the magical world's food chain. The fact that such a witch hunter was found dead was a very interesting event from the perspective of the Tower of the Waning Moon, so they couldn't take their eyes off it.

More importantly, "Baek Yuseol seems to have some idea about the witch," Hyejin noted. While the Stella Knights were desperately trying to track the witch's whereabouts, Baek Yuseol was calmly observing the scene. Given that Baek Yuseol was Baek Yuseol, it was natural to suspect that he knew something.

"Should we follow Baek Yuseol?" Hyejin's idea of choosing the most efficient method to track the witch was certainly correct.

"...Let's watch a bit longer," Kaen said before leaping off the building and disappearing somewhere.

"Ugh... He could at least say something before leaving," Hyejin grumbled. As a knight, Kaen could move freely like that, but Hyejin, being a pure magic-type bishop, had to walk down the stairs step by step to get off the building. The thought of going back down made her feel dizzy, but the possibility of meeting the witch made her lips curl into a smile.

The next morning.

"Hey, did you hear? There was a murder at the Witch's Restaurant last night."

"I heard the owner was killed."

"No, I heard a black-robed figure appeared, and the waitress fought them to a standstill."

"But someone must have died, right? The Stella Magic Investigation Team has occupied the scene since last night."

Early in the classroom, Eizel overheard strange rumors among the students.

"Eizel! Did you hear? Did you hear?"

"Yes... roughly."

"What could it be?" her friend Marillen exclaimed.

"I heard a legendary witch hunter appeared."

"A witch... hunter?"

"Yes, according to witnesses, the wizard who attacked the Witch's Restaurant had no limbs and looked like a ghost, with glowing eyes, resembling a witch hunter."

"No way. There's no witch, so how could there be a witch hunter..."

"Right? But doesn't it seem like there could be something? Even if it's a legend, you never know. There were cases of witch sightings a few years ago."

Eizel fell silent, unsure of what to say. Perhaps Marillen was right, and witches did exist. By now, Baek Yuseol was probably chasing a witch.

'What on earth is going on...'

She had heard the rumors. Yesterday, Baek Yuseol had gone somewhere with the Stella Knights. The news that followed was about the incident at the Witch's Restaurant, so she couldn't help but worry.

Suddenly, she felt a sense of self-loathing. What had she been doing last night? Studying. As always, she had been studying. While he was busy solving something related to the witch, she had been obsessively studying, knowing nothing. It was pathetic. But even so... it would be foolish to rush in and offer help without knowing anything about the situation. Even if she knew, how could she possibly deal with a witch?

Ding-dong-dang!

After class, she walked towards Class S with a heavy heart. On the way, she overheard, "Did you hear? Baek Yuseol is skipping class today," which made her feel even worse.

"Ah, shut up and get lost," she heard a familiar voice in the hallway and turned her head. Some students glanced that way but quickly passed by, pretending not to know.

'Flame Yang...?'

And next to her was the beautiful golden-haired boy, Jeremy Skalven, the crown prince.

"Ah, sorry. I was inconsiderate," Jeremy apologized awkwardly, but Flame was still grinding her teeth in anger.

"Who told you to put me in as a participant? It's annoying. Now I have to go through the hassle of canceling the application."

"Well, I heard you were interested in the League of Spirits recently..."

"So you put me in a first-come, first-served competition as a parachute? Over other athletes who wanted to participate?"

"It's not a parachute..."

"And when did I say I wanted to compete? I just enjoy watching the games, you idiot."

Listening to them, it was clear why Flame was angry. Anyone would be upset if they woke up to find themselves suddenly a participant in a competition.

"Sigh... How do I cancel this now?"

Eizel decided to pass by quietly, not wanting to get involved in their argument. Jeremy Skalven, despite his kind appearance, had something very unsettling about him.

'...By the way, the application period is over, so it can't be canceled now.'

She was worried for a moment, but she thought Flame would figure something out. Just as she was about to pass by, Flame noticed her and waved exaggeratedly.

"Oh, Eizel! I was looking for you! Come with me!"

"Huh? What? Me?"

Flame quickly put her arm around Eizel's shoulder and started walking fast.

"Let's walk quickly. I don't want to argue with that guy anymore."

"Ah, okay...!"

Looking back, she saw Jeremy reaching out with a forlorn expression, as if he were watching a tragic heroine. But Flame didn't seem to care at all. After walking quickly for a while, they finally stopped and caught their breath.

"Whew, that guy is like a leech."

"What happened...?"

"Just the usual annoying stuff."

She didn't seem to want to explain further. It looked like she didn't want to dwell on the irritating matter.

Clunk!

Flame bought an ion drink from a nearby vending machine, opened the can, and drank it in one go. Then she tossed the can into the trash can and sat down on a nearby bench, patting the seat next to her.

"What are you doing? Are you busy? Do you have another class?"

"No... I have about 40 minutes."

"Then sit down for a bit. I have something on my mind."

"Something on your mind...?"

It was surprising to hear that even someone as straightforward as Flame had worries. Curious, Eizel sat down cautiously, and Flame spoke with a serious expression.

"I'm torn between having cheese cutlet or rosé cutlet for lunch."

"This is a serious problem. If I order rosé and it doesn't taste good, I'll waste money and ruin my appetite. But if I order cheese cutlet, which I always have, it won't be new and exciting. It's a high-risk, high-return situation."

Was it appropriate to use the term "high-risk, high-return" in this context?

"Why not try the rosé cutlet for a change?"

"No, on second thought, that's not it."

"...Then have the cheese cutlet."

"I'm tired of it. I'll just have the tenderloin cutlet."

What was she supposed to say to that?

"This is new and guaranteed to be tasty. Wow, I feel like a genius today."

"Sure..."

Eizel couldn't help but laugh, and Flame's expression hardened.

"I'm serious."

"Of course..."

"Shall we go?"

"Huh? Where?"

"We decided, right? To have cutlet."

"But it's still morning..."

"So what? We'll have brunch."

"Oh..."

"By the way, brunch means breakfast and lunch combined."

"I know."

Eizel chuckled and nodded. She realized she hadn't had a proper breakfast, and listening to Flame's nonsense had somehow lifted a weight off her chest.

At 10:18 AM, a time too early for lunch and too late for breakfast, Eizel found herself eating tenderloin cutlet in the school cafeteria. It had been a while since she had used a knife to cut meat. As she carefully cut the cutlet with a knife, Flame, across from her, stabbed the cutlet with a fork, split it in half, and took a big bite. She dipped the cutlet in the sauce, eating it with gusto, and then suddenly spoke.

"Do you want to go out tonight?"

"Huh? Where?"

"To Arcanium."

"Oh... you mean go out?"

Was she suggesting they have dinner? But Flame seemed to have a different idea.

"Yeah. I'm curious about what Baek Yuseol is up to, and I feel restless."

"Are you planning to help Baek Yuseol?"

"Maybe? Yeah, you could say that."

"But we're dealing with a witch. There's nothing we can do..."

They had to be realistic. No matter how much people praised them as genius wizards, the world Baek Yuseol lived in was completely different. With their still immature abilities, they would only be a hindrance.

"Do you think I'm crazy enough to fight a witch?"

"Then what are you planning to do...?"

Flame hesitated, then closed her mouth. According to what she knew, the Tower of the Waning Moon's Destruction Squad would be in Arcanium by now. She planned to use them, but she couldn't reveal that.

"I can't tell you now, but it will definitely help. I'm sure of it."

Eizel looked into Flame's eyes. They were different from the playful eyes she had seen earlier. She wasn't sure what Flame was planning or if she could even do anything, but... she decided to trust her. They had shared many secrets and were very close friends.
