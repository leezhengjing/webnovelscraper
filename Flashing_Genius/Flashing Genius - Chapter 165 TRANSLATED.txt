# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 165: Urban Legends (1)

Hong Biyeon and Eijel. The two, symbolizing blazing red flames and icy blue ice, seemed completely incompatible, but if one tried to find common ground, it was surprisingly easy. 

First, they both raised their pride high to protect themselves. Second, when they became curious about something, they would dig into it no matter what. Third, they both had a deep interest in a particular person. 

Their commonalities overlapped in such a way that it erased the friction and intense atmosphere of their opposing attributes, making them quite compatible. Thus, seeing the two sitting together in the library, studying something, was a curious sight for other students.

"Hey, look over there."

"The princess and that traitor's..."

"Shh. Who calls her that these days? Are you clueless?"

"Oh, right... sorry."

Recently, the perception of the Morf family had been changing little by little because of Eijel. Despite growing up in an environment filled with hatred and ridicule due to the stigma of being a traitor's child, she constantly worked hard and entered Stella with top grades. 

Not only that, she proposed new possibilities for elemental magic and reached the 4th class at the young age of seventeen. Her sense of justice and perseverance in any incident made her a role model for many aspiring magic warriors. 

In fact, among commoners or lower-class students who didn't have any particular thoughts about the "black magic traitor," she was quite popular. Teenagers couldn't help but be drawn to her life story, which was like a youth comic about a star rising despite harsh conditions.

Because of this, no one approached the table where Eijel and Hong Biyeon were sitting, even though it was an eight-seater. Or rather, they couldn't. The two were huddled together, not just working on a regular assignment but discussing something with thick books piled up, making notes and talking in quiet tones. Who would dare to intrude on that territory?

"They must be researching some amazing magic, not just school homework."

"Yeah. They're different from ordinary students like us."

"Shh. Let's pass quietly."

...Thus, the two girls, who captured the awe and respect of the students, were researching a subject.

**"What is a Noble Soul?"**

It was a study on souls, which had no practical use in the development of magic and hadn't been properly proven yet. No wizard had yet revealed the true nature of the soul. Because necromancy was considered the domain of black wizards, the field hadn't properly developed. 

Moreover, necromancy wasn't just a field that could be solved through magical research; it involved many philosophical elements, earning it the disgraceful title of "zero contribution to the development of magic," making it a field no one touched. 

There were even tearful stories of some students, desperate for credits, dabbling in it only to fall asleep during class, causing their average grades to drop.

The research on noble souls was filled with negative content from the first page, but from the next, numerous historical examples were listed. 

In conclusion:

"Humans cannot be noble, but if they contribute to or sacrifice for the world, they can possess a soul close to nobility."

This could be summarized as such.

"...I don't quite understand."

Since it was her first time studying this field, Hong Biyeon pressed her temples, indicating she didn't quite get it. Eijel, feeling the same, groaned but explained what she had somewhat understood.

"Looking at the list of noble people in history, most of them were called 'saints' or 'holy ones.'"

Great figures who gave generously of themselves, sacrificed for others, and fought to wipe away others' tears even if it meant shedding their own blood. Most of them couldn't even use holy magic. According to testimonies from that time, lowly beings were not qualified to learn holy magic. 

But they advanced medicine to heal others without holy magic, led wars to victory to protect their people, researched alchemy to develop potions, and some even became great wizards later on. Saints and holy ones... they realized their justice in the world in various ways. 

They were completely different from the saints and holy ones arbitrarily designated by the current Holy Kingdom, truly revered figures whose names people naturally called out. These were the people closest to possessing noble souls.

Here's the problem.

"Even these people only got close to having a noble soul but didn't fully possess one."

"...That's right."

Humans cannot possess a noble soul. That absolute proposition has never been broken by anyone. But... Baek Yuseol broke it. This was truly astonishing, but unfortunately, no one knew how great and significant it was because no one was interested in necromancy.

Thud! Hong Biyeon closed the book. There was no need for long research or worry. The conclusion was immediately clear.

"...I roughly understand."

"Indeed... Baek Yuseol, through countless regressions, must have taken countless lives. Even from the brief glimpse in the 'Library of Stars,' Baek Yuseol's life was stained with blood, covered in unerasable sins. The countless karmic debts were not enough to dye his soul the darkest black, yet he somehow possessed a soul so bright it was blinding.

According to the book, the conclusion was simple. Baek Yuseol had made countless sacrifices to save the world, far more than the sins he committed, and as a result, he finally possessed a noble soul. The girls couldn't even imagine the process it took to get there. They just painfully realized how young they were.

What genius wizard? What talent blessed by magic? The Adolevit royal family? The Morf family? Those who praised such hollow shells... knew nothing. The real one was elsewhere. The one with the greatest name in the world was living quietly.

Suddenly, Hong Biyeon felt ashamed of her life so far. The days she lived arrogantly as a princess of the Adolevit royal family. The behavior of looking down on everyone below her as equals. She wanted to erase it all if she could. 

Hong Biyeon silently stood up without even pulling her chair. There was no need for greetings. After all, they were just sitting together to read the same book for a while; the awkwardness between her and Eijel remained. Eijel didn't stop her or even look at her as she left. She just stayed there, carefully reading the remaining pages.

"This is... no longer meaningful to read, but the girl's curiosity was strong. Eijel, deeply curious about the areas she didn't know, found something quite interesting.

The great wizard and black magician from Stella, Abelain Staberk. Eijel knew that name well. Her father had told her about him when she was young.

"That person was quite a weirdo. He once sent an entire main tower to the opposite side of the world during his time at Stella."

"That's amazing..."

"Amazing indeed. The missing tower couldn't even be retrieved by the principal, so it's completely gone now. Even during my school days, the 7th main tower didn't exist."

That was a story from more than half a century ago. Now that he had become a black magician, all history about Abelain Staberk within Stella had been erased. Elteman Eltewin, who despised black magicians, had buried everything in secrecy. 

Thus, the existence of the '7th main tower' was just an urban legend among students. 

"Hmm..."

Eijel knew some truth about that legend. She had heard stories from her father, who had experienced a major incident at Stella. 

"The 7th main tower... Study ends here."

She closed the book. Her curiosity was satisfied.

* * *

Stella Academy had countless urban legends. With over a hundred years of history and various unique wizards leaving their marks, and the school grounds being as large as a small city, it was inevitable for legends to arise. 

Some legends were so unrealistic and absurd that they were dismissed as nonsense, but if one were to count the few legends that students truly believed, the '7th main tower legend' would be a prime example.

**"There is no seventh main tower at this school."**

**"If you happen to enter a main tower with the number nine written on it while passing through the corridors between the main towers, turn back immediately and leave with the same stride as usual."**

**"In this case, even if you hear a female student calling you from behind, ignore it."**

**"If you see a student in a white uniform leading the way in the corridor of the 4th main tower, do not follow. There are no white uniforms at this school."**

**"Do not cross from the 6th main tower to the 3rd main tower at midnight. If you happen to pass by a stained mirror in the 3rd main tower, avoid looking at it. If you accidentally make eye contact with yourself in the mirror, close your eyes and count to 100 before passing through. Nothing will happen."**

There were more than ten Neapolitan legends related to the 7th main tower, showing how much interest students had in these legends. Naturally, none of them had been proven true. Even students who had grown up hearing the 7th main tower legends and became professors after decades had never seen it. 

However, every few years, a student would claim to have entered the 7th main tower and then drop out, keeping the legend alive and sparking new interest each year.

"Does it really exist?"

"No way. The principal even declared it doesn't exist."

"Yeah. But isn't it suspicious that the professors keep telling us not to mention it?"

"Right."

As with most legends, the topic quickly shifted and was soon forgotten without any truth being revealed. However, Flame recently paid attention to the revived 7th main tower legend. She knew the truth about the legend through the original novel.

"It's just a rumor..."

Anella looked at Flame, who was investigating the 7th main tower, with a skeptical eye. The initial scary atmosphere was gone, and seeing her chase after such legends and rumors made her seem like an ordinary girl. 

...Sometimes, when she manifested her radiant magic, it was terrifying, but that was that, and this was this.

"Yeah. It's just a rumor. But why would such a rumor suddenly spread recently?"

A week had passed since the school competition ended, and scary stories were trending in the school as a summer special. So, it wasn't strange for a Neapolitan legend to trend as well. However, the 7th main tower legend was particularly vivid and spread unusually fast, as if someone wanted the students to be interested in it.

Flame knew the reason but didn't bother explaining it to Anella. Revealing the truth before the 'beginning' of the 'rising action' in the story would be like revealing the 'conclusion' prematurely.

"Still, it definitely exists."

In the original novel, Professor Meizen Tiren deliberately spread the rumor about the 7th main tower. But with her gone, the fact that the story was still so prevalent meant that someone else was 100% spreading it. So, she just needed to find that person. Fortunately, Anella, who could distinguish black magicians, was with her, so identifying a black magician not mentioned in the original novel should be possible.

By narrowing down the suspects and having Anella confirm if they were black magicians, the game would be over. She could prevent the '7th main tower black magician invasion incident,' one of the worst events, before it even started.

"...So, do you really think one of the professors is the culprit?"

"I'm not sure. But I'll investigate first, and if not, I'll move on."

A student visiting a professor was a common occurrence. Flame was an honor student with knowledge in various fields, so it wouldn't be strange for her to visit a professor to ask questions about a subject she didn't take.

There were many suspicious suspects. Flame planned to visit them one by one to narrow down the suspects. It was a primitive method, but the most reliable one for a student.

"Then, let's go!"

As Flame confidently headed towards a professor's office, Anella followed with a dying expression. And from across the corridor, someone secretly watching Flame moved stealthily. He stared at the office Flame entered for a long time before reluctantly turning away. The place where he stood left no trace, only a quiet silence lingering.
