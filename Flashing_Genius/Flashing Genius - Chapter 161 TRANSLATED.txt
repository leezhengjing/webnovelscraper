# I Became a Genius at Magic School 161

## 38. The Curse of Love (1)

When I struck the back of Orenha's neck to knock him out, it was an instinctive action.

Thud!

After catching Orenha's falling body and laying him on the sofa, I turned to look at Ggotseorin. She was covering her mouth with a stunned expression.

When someone with the trait [Curse of Love] makes eye contact with another, their heart is stolen from that moment, and the curse's effect is irreversible. In other words, she had lost her most cherished subordinate right here today.

"Ah..."

Ggotseorin sighed as she looked at the unconscious Orenha.

Whoosh!

Then, as Orenha started foaming at the mouth and his body convulsed, creating a small vortex of mana, she hurriedly checked his condition. Placing her hand on Orenha's head and sending a green aura, she felt the chaotic flow of mana.

Thud!

As his upper body sprang up like a spring, almost colliding with Ggotseorin, Baek Yuseol quickly pressed him down to stop him.

"How is he?"

"...Not good. His mana is completely tangled. This is almost like..."

Ggotseorin held back from saying "mana rampage." For a mage, a mana rampage, where all the mana in their body is released uncontrollably like a bomb, is the most humiliating and worst accident. A mage who experiences a mana rampage loses all their mana and can never live as a mage again.

Knowing how much Orenha loved magic, she tried her best to stop it by injecting her mana with all her might.

'Damn it.'

Baek Yuseol couldn't hide his complicated expression as he watched Ggotseorin struggle to stop Orenha's rampage. Orenha was supposed to be a remarkable mage. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn't have been knocked out by a mere hand strike from Baek Yuseol.

In the original story, the phrase "Those who look at Ggotseorin's face fall into lovesickness and wither away" often appeared. That was only true for ordinary people. The higher the level of the mage, the longer they could withstand her curse. However, even if they didn't die from lovesickness, their minds would become confused, and the mana within them would twist, potentially causing a mana rampage that could affect those around them.

Orenha had made eye contact with Ggotseorin from a very close distance for several seconds, and perhaps due to the previous incident, his mental strength had weakened, making him unable to control his mana at all. If he hadn't been knocked out, he might have exploded, causing all the buildings in the area to collapse.

"Sigh..."

Ggotseorin, sweating profusely as she injected mana, looked at Orenha with a deeply regretful face.

"I told you not to let anyone near..."

Why did he not listen again and cause such a mess? But regardless of whether Orenha listened or not, it was ultimately her curse that caused this, and a heavy sense of guilt settled in her heart. How could she ever rid herself of this increasingly heavy burden?

Orenha was one of the few people who brought peace to Ggotseorin's heart, and his sudden change in behavior today was both puzzling and resentful. It would have been so nice if he had just stayed by her side as her aide, friend, and companion as usual.

"Your Majesty! Are you alright?"

The royal guards, who had keenly sensed the mana disturbance in the reception room, shouted from outside. Ggotseorin quickly put on her mask, controlled her mana to suppress the curse as much as possible, and responded.

"Yes. There's an urgent patient, so please come in quickly."

The door opened, and the royal guards rushed in, looking bewildered.

"This is..."

They were shocked to see that the person who had collapsed was none other than the king's aide. As Orenha's body convulsed and unstable mana leaked out, the royal guards hurriedly moved Ggotseorin to safety.

"Your Majesty, please step back. The aide cannot control his mana. We will transport him to the cradle of the Celestial Tree immediately, but you should stay away to avoid getting caught in the rampage."

"No, there's no time to move. We must take immediate action here. If a rampage occurs, I will stop it myself."

"But..."

"Do not make me repeat myself, Captain Rymseril."

"...I apologize. I will call the medical team immediately."

As the knights hurriedly moved, it wasn't long before the mages and specialists from Stella arrived. Additionally, saints rushed in, chanting prayers and setting up barriers around the area, turning the space into a sealed room. The barriers were meant to prevent the shock from escaping, but it was futile. If Orenha, a 6th-class mage, went into a mana rampage, the power would be at least 7th or 8th class, easily breaking through such barriers.

Ggotseorin's power, weakened without the support of the World Tree, was currently very fragile, so she couldn't rely on it.

"In an emergency, we went to find the principal of Stella, but his whereabouts are unknown. After the previous incident, he disappeared, saying he would deal with the remaining vermin, and we haven't heard from him since..."

"I see."

To make matters worse, even Elteman Eltewin had disappeared. 

"Your Majesty, the mana rampage is getting more violent!"

"Ugh... Please evacuate!"

As the situation grew more serious, I quietly watched Orenha. There were similar cases in the original game. Excellent mages who accidentally made eye contact with Ggotseorin would go into a rampage, causing significant damage to their surroundings. Honestly, the game company probably prepared it as an event, but as a gamer, it was just annoying and frustrating. Having to deal with the rampage of extras was a hassle.

Thus, veteran players who didn't want to waste time on the rampage of extras resorted to extreme measures.

"Let's kill them before they rampage."

A simple yet brutal method. It was also an impossible method now. Despite his misdeeds, Orenha was a cherished subordinate of Ggotseorin, so she wouldn't let him die easily. But unfortunately, Orenha would eventually rampage, causing great damage and ultimately dying, leaving a deep scar on Ggotseorin's heart.

There was only one way left.

"Your Majesty."

Baek Yuseol cautiously spoke to the anxious Ggotseorin.

"There is one way."

The best way to suppress the mana rampage and prevent him from becoming a dark mage. It wasn't a method only he knew. Everyone present knew it too.

"If we sever his mana... we can save him."

Rather than letting him die from a mana rampage, wouldn't it be better to sever his mana and at least save his life? Everyone present agreed with the statement, but it was a difficult one to voice. Orenha was Ggotseorin's most cherished subordinate. For a mage, magic is like their limbs. Severing their mana is more painful than cutting off all their limbs. Even if he survived today, Orenha would never be able to live a normal life again.

"The decision must be made by Your Majesty."

Even the silent captain of the knights added a word, causing Ggotseorin's eyes to waver greatly. Should she cripple her most cherished subordinate with her own hands? Was it right to do so for something caused by her? Would he resent her?

"Ugh... Captain... I'm sorry, I can't hold on any longer..."

One by one, the knights controlling the mana rampage began to collapse. Captain Rymseril, being a 7th-class mage, could hold on, but it seemed impossible to completely suppress the rampage. Unable to bear seeing her cherished ones fall one by one, Ggotseorin, with tears in her eyes, had no choice but to make a decision.

"Sever Orenha's mana..."

The next day arrived. A small incident had occurred within the main building of Stella, but the guests were unaware and were leaving for their respective homes. After the unusually noisy and eventful school competition, Stella Academy had quieted down. Jelliel was staring blankly out the window from a first-class hospital room in Stella Academy. She had been advised to stay still for rehabilitation, so she was forced to take a break.

It was a disappointing school competition. She couldn't even attend the award ceremony for the Magic Survival. She heard that something interesting had happened there, but she couldn't see it herself, which was regrettable. Lying in the hospital room, Jelliel stared blankly out the window. The burns had healed quickly. The top priests from the Holy Kingdom had poured divine magic on her, so it would have been strange if scars remained. However, the mental scars lingered deeply, tormenting her.

It wasn't the shock of being attacked by a dark mage. It was just... a certain 'emotion' she felt at the moment of death. Emotions were naturally present in intelligent beings, but for some reason, they were all unfamiliar to Jelliel. She was used to acting out emotions, even fooling her father, but actually feeling them was almost a first for her. Even now, when she recalled that moment, it vividly came to mind. Baek Yuseol's black eyes, deeper and clearer than the night sky. Those eyes, resembling the universe, sparkled as he saved her.

"Why?"

The first question created ripples in the lake of her mind. The small waves hit the wall and returned, creating more questions.

"Didn't Baek Yuseol hate me?"

Baek Yuseol knew her well. He knew her too well. Otherwise, he wouldn't have set such terrible conditions through the mana oath.

"Did he save me to make me suffer more?"

If he saved her for that reason, he must be crazier than she was.

"Miss. I brought some strawberries."

The door to the hospital room opened, and her bodyguard, Seong Taewon, entered. Strawberries were the only fruit Jelliel liked, so he would bring them whenever something bad happened, even without her asking.

"Thank you."

Jelliel put on a mask. A mask called a smile. When she smiled like this, her subordinates were happy. But...

"...I'm sorry. It seems you don't like strawberries today."

"Huh? No, I like them. Why do you say that?"

"Well... Seong Taewon glanced at her cautiously and spoke carefully.

"Your expression doesn't look good..."

She hurriedly touched her face. Why? She had failed to put on the 'smile' mask. Even though she tried to force a smile, it wouldn't come. Jelliel spoke calmly, trying to hide her feelings.

"I'm just a little tired."

"I understand."

"Have you packed all my things?"

Due to the mana oath, she could no longer see her father, but Jelliel would keep moving forward. She couldn't afford to stop because of a small obstacle in front of her when she was in a hurry to save her father.

'Once I save my father, I can smile and look back in the future.'

For that time, she would bury her current emotions deep inside.

"If everything is ready, let's go back."

"Yes. I will call for the private jet."

Seong Taewon, who had bowed his head, turned to leave the hospital room but suddenly remembered something and spoke to her.

"Oh, and the stone piece in your private room..."

"Huh? Was there such a thing?"

Thinking for a moment, she recalled that Baek Yuseol had given her a stone piece as a gift after the mana oath. It was absurd. Giving such trash as a gift to Jelliel, the richest person in the world, was an act of disrespect.

"Throw it away."

Without hesitation, Jelliel gave the order, but... Seong Taewon, with a troubled expression, stammered.

"Actually, while organizing your belongings, I showed it to an archaeologist at Stella out of personal curiosity."

"What? How dare you touch my belongings..."

Even though it was trash, it was an act that crossed the line, and Jelliel was about to scold him. But before she could, Seong Taewon hurriedly continued.

"As a result, something very interesting came out. That stone piece is actually a part of the 'Ancient Carmen Set Stele'!"

"...What?"

At that moment, Jelliel's mind went blank.

"Yes, it's true. The archaeologist at Stella was so surprised that he brought another researcher and used special equipment to examine it properly. They confirmed it was indeed a part of the Carmen Set Stele!"

The Ancient Carmen Set. That was... the very thing Jelliel had been searching for all her life to save her father. And it suddenly appeared here? Given by Baek Yuseol?

"Ah..."

Jelliel, her legs giving out, sat back down on the hospital bed, unable to think of anything. She needed... a little more time to think.
