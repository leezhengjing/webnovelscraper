# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 190

## 43. Everything is Frozen (3)

A thousand years have passed since Lisbond lost its role as a port city, and now no one calls this place a port anymore. Lisbond is so famous for its dungeons and monsters that it is filled with adventurers seeking quick riches. However, the existence of a "dungeon" is not something that can be easily found. Therefore, the news that Baek Yuseol discovered a dungeon was enough to perk up the ears of adventurers.

"Did you hear? A dungeon has been discovered after a long time."

"Is it the first time in half a year since White Scadia?"

"Yeah, dungeons have been scarce lately..."

"Hey, but can we trust the discoverer if he's a student?"

"Haven't you heard? He's a student of Stella."

"Oh, then he's trustworthy."

Thanks to the credibility that comes with Stella's uniform, dozens of adventurers expressed their intention to participate in the dungeon overnight. However, there was one thing that even Baek Yuseol did not expect.

"Baek Yuseol?"

"Yes, that's right. Lisbond Port is right around here."

The news reached the ears of Kaen, the leader of the 13th Extermination Squad of the Tower of the Waning Moon, and Hyeijin.

"Other famous adventurers are also curious about that kid Baek Yuseol and are cautiously watching him."

The name Baek Yuseol had become quite well-known, and his actions piqued people's curiosity.

"Are you going to apply? I'm not really interested..."

Hyeijin's specialty was illusion magic. She was trained to deal with black magicians and wizards, so she knew how to handle destructive magic, but she still felt reluctant. However, Kaen had never been considerate of Hyeijin.

"We're going."

"Eeeh, I don't want to..."

This was not a matter of simple curiosity. Although they had encountered Baek Yuseol a few times, they had never seen his true skills. So, if they could gauge Baek Yuseol's real abilities while attacking the dungeon this time, it wouldn't be a bad condition.

'He is someone we must keep an eye on...'

Even the master of the Tower of the Waning Moon was concerned about Baek Yuseol, so Kaen intended to delve deeper into him. In fact, Kaen was not the only one with such thoughts. There were people who, upon hearing the name Baek Yuseol, thought, 'Oh, that famous student?' and showed a bit of interest, while others wanted to see his skills firsthand.

"What's this...?"

Baek Yuseol was taken aback as he read the unexpectedly luxurious applications. More skilled individuals than he had anticipated had applied. Among the applications, a few stood out, making him laugh because their intentions were so obvious.

'Why did this guy come...?'

Kaen, the leader of the 13th Extermination Squad, had boldly left his application blank, as if to say he would kill if not accepted. Baek Yuseol had no choice but to accept him. Besides, many renowned magic warriors and mercenaries had applied, bringing the number to over twenty.

And on the day of the dungeon exploration departure, the party members, seeing each other's faces for the first time, looked at each other with expressions that said, 'Oh, you came too?' They were all familiar with each other, having been in this field for a long time.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Baek Yuseol, the party leader."

Although Baek Yuseol felt a slight burden due to the veteran adventurers, he decided to relax, knowing that he was the leader by contract.

"Young party leader, is it true that there's a dungeon?"

"Of course. Did you apply without believing that?"

"Well, it looked interesting."

"Haha..."

There were many peculiar party members.

"There really is a dungeon. If there isn't... I'll be beaten to death."

When Baek Yuseol glanced at the party members, a few laughed. After all, if he had lied to these veterans, even a student of Stella wouldn't get away unscathed.

"There really is a dungeon. And it will probably be quite an interesting experience for you all."

"That's strange... I've searched this area thoroughly for ten years, and there was no sign of a dungeon."

"Well, dungeons are like that, aren't they? Sometimes, you wake up to find a dungeon entrance in your bedroom."

"That's true."

Since dungeon entrances were discovered so irregularly, such excuses were convenient. And in fact, Baek Yuseol had not yet found the dungeon entrance. If asked why he hadn't done a preliminary survey, he would answer that it was impossible. There was one more condition needed for the dungeon entrance to open.

Kuuuu...!

At the loud rumbling from somewhere, all the party members looked up at the sky. Five large combat airships bearing the royal flag of Adolevit were just taking off. Their destination was none other than the giant frozen whirlpool and the eternally slumbering 'Black Cross' from a thousand years ago.

'It's starting.'

It was no coincidence that the dungeon exploration was scheduled on the same day as Adolevit's departure ceremony. When they disturbed the ghost of the pirate king, Black Bellis, and the ice avatar resurrected, the dungeon entrance would finally open.

"Let's go."

I led the party towards the frozen sea. In fact, launching an airship on the frozen coast of Levian was madness, unless you had the insane budget of the Adolevit royal family. Our party moved on foot. Honestly, if I had the budget, I could have made a magical sled that could run on ice, but it was too risky. You never know when a monster might pop out from under the frozen sea.

"Wow... they must have spent a fortune."

"Looks like the royal family is serious this time."

"I wish I knew why..."

The party members chatted leisurely while dealing with ice monsters and creatures emerging from the sea. The sight of the airships flying high in the sky was spectacular. I also pretended to fight, drawing my sword. Of course, I rarely had to step forward. Veteran adventurers might seem like they only use cold weapons, but to survive for so long, learning specialized magic was essential, so everyone here was a skilled magician. I didn't need to step in and fight; they handled the enemies with magic.

"By the way, the party leader, despite being a kid, planned the route quite well."

"Indeed."

"He only brought essential equipment without any vanity... seems quite serious."

"Huh. Is there really such a thing as a genius? It took me about three years under a previous party leader to plan a route like this."

The frozen sea of Levian was a monster den and a maze, so planning a route to the dungeon required a lot of thought. Of course, Baek Yuseol didn't have such great abilities. He just had experience wandering this path several times to try the dungeon.

"This way."

"Wow..."

"Scary."

"Is there really a dungeon here?"

The place we arrived at was a giant crevasse with sharp, descending ice cliffs. The party members looked tense as they stared at the endless ice precipice.

"Was there originally such a place?"

Probably not. This terrain must have formed for the first time. This dungeon would be a unique and mysterious place that adventurers had never experienced before. Instead of monsters, spirits would appear. And at the final destination of this dungeon was a forbidden place where humans should never set foot, the 'World of Ice Spirits.'

"Surely, no one will back out now, right?"

"No! If you back out, I'll kill you. I'm actually getting more excited."

"Hoo... It's been a while since I had such an adventure."

"Damn. If I knew it would be this fun, I would have properly repaired my staff."

"Have you not repaired that staff for ten years?"

As expected, the adventurers were quite excited. Baek Yuseol couldn't hide his satisfaction as he watched them.

'Yes, enjoy it more.'

While they were busy fighting the spirits, Baek Yuseol planned to stay behind and enjoy the show. It was unfortunate for the adventurers who came to see his skills, but... from the beginning, Baek Yuseol had no intention of drawing his staff during this dungeon exploration.

Above the Levian coast, Hong Biyeon quietly looked down at the ground, facing the chilly wind. The magical barrier of the airship blocked most of the cold wind, but a minimal amount of air seeped in, hitting her cheeks. Uoooo... From afar, an unidentified wailing sound came from the Black Cross. It was not a hallucination. History recorded that this sound had always been heard whenever someone approached this area. No one knew the exact nature of the wailing, but most speculated that it was the ancient pirate king warning people not to come closer.

As the airship approached the Black Cross, her heart pounded with tension. It would be a lie to say she wasn't nervous. But it was something she had to do.

"Princess Hong Biyeon."

Turning slowly, she saw Queen Hong Seryu approaching with three female priests. She also had a tense expression, probably because she had to break the promise of her ancestors in her generation. She must not be at ease either.

"Yes."

"Prepare yourself."

Hong Seryu said, looking into the distance.

"No matter what happens, don't worry. I'll take care of everything."

"Yes, I trust you."

Despite their words, they did not look into each other's eyes. Neither Hong Seryu nor Hong Biyeon trusted each other. But even so, Hong Biyeon could feel at ease. She didn't trust the queen, but she knew that someone she truly trusted was somewhere here, moving quickly. He was probably fighting an unknown battle in a place as suffocating and dangerous as this. Thanks to that...

'I will definitely succeed.'

Hong Biyeon steeled her resolve.
