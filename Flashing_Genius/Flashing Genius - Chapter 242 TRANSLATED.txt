# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy's Front Flash

## Chapter 242: The Witch (9)

The mysterious beings known as the Twelve Divine Moons (十二神月) were born inheriting the power of the twelve moons, seasons, and elements. Each of them possessed different powers, personalities, and appearances, making it impossible to find any similarities among them. Some hid in the gaps of other dimensions, living with spirits, while others created their own kingdoms in hidden depths, ruling over their subjects. Some slept for long periods, some suppressed their own powers and suffered, and some lived among humans, pretending to be one of them.

Among them, Huikong Shiyue (灰空十月) was the least distinctive. He merely wandered the world leisurely, observing without interfering in anything. However, recently, cracks began to appear in Huikong Shiyue's "indifference." The one who never interfered with the workings of the world... started to get involved little by little.

"It can't be helped," Huikong Shiyue thought as he moved, but he knew better than anyone that there was no such thing as "it can't be helped" in this world, leading him into a contradiction and confusion.

"Why is this happening?"

The world follows its destiny. If the destiny of the local bakery owner is to have bread for breakfast, it will inevitably happen. Having observed destiny countless times, he firmly believed that "destiny" was unchangeable. However, recently, the world seemed strange. Others might not notice, but Huikong Shiyue could tell. The world was not flowing according to the natural order of destiny.

He realized this decisively when he arrived at the Levian Coast of the Adolevit Kingdom.

"This is...!"

The sea, which had been frozen for hundreds of years, had completely thawed, and the Levian Coast had regained its seasons, no longer suffering from extreme cold. People were enjoying the warm summer season, wearing swimsuits and surfing at the beach, and the pirate ship Black Cross, which had been eternally frozen in the heart of the sea, had become a tourist attraction.

This was strange. Very... strange. Having observed destiny countless times, he knew well. The Levian Coast should have been a hellish place covered in icy disaster, where no living creature could survive. Yet, it was mimicking a vacation spot.

"What happened while I wasn't looking?"

He gazed at the sky with his gray eyes. No one could see stars in the bright daylight, but the constellations were clearly reflected in Huikong Shiyue's eyes.

"Does this mean I won't just observe destiny this time?"

He soon averted his gaze from the constellations and turned to leave.

"Hey, wait! That's a cliff! It's dangerous if you go to the edge...!"

A civilian shouted at Huikong Shiyue from behind, but he soon disappeared into the gray space between dimensions.

"Huh...?"

The man who tried to stop him tilted his head, wondering if he had seen a ghost. It seemed that strange things were happening frequently these days.

* * *

Drip-! The sound of water droplets echoed, filling the narrow space. Splash!

The witch Melisher clutched her abdomen as she slowly walked through the underground sewers of Arcanium. The wound inflicted by a witch hunter had not yet healed, making it impossible for her to properly use her magic. The very fact that she had to wander through the smelly sewers was disgusting and humiliating, but she had no choice. Surviving against a witch hunter was enough to be satisfied with for now.

"Hah... It's okay... I just need a little more time. Once I recover a bit more, I can run the Witch's Restaurant again. But I can't take too long a break. The students who are still mildly addicted will soon break free from my magic. Especially the students from prestigious schools who are naturally gifted with magic; their recovery will be even faster."

"Hey, you look like you're in a lot of pain. Why don't you come over here for a bit?"

Startled by the voice from behind, Melisher quickly pointed her staff. There stood a woman, smiling brightly at her.

"Why are you so surprised? It's not strange for someone to live in the underground sewers of Arcanium, is it?"

"...Are you from the Black Magic Union?"

"Yes, you know well? We're not particularly hostile to you. We could even help you a bit."

"Get lost. Do you think I don't know you came for my crystal ball?"

"Well, that's true, but wouldn't it be nice to get along since we're both hiding? Oh, are you different? I heard you were quite active on the surface."

"I'm better than you who hide in these disgusting sewers like cockroaches."

"That might be true... But looking at your beaten-up state, I think hiding might be better."

"You bastard..."

"Think about it later. Hiding here isn't so bad, you know?"

"No matter how low I fall, I won't live a vulgar life like you."

"Okay, then. Take care~!"

As the black magic woman disappeared into the shadows, Melisher slumped against the wall.

"Disgusting bastards..."

Wizards and black magicians are all the same. She barely restrained the urge to tear them apart and dissect them one by one. 

"If I expand my territory in Arcanium, I'll clean up the sewers first..."

She had heard that the Archmage of Arcanium was raising a few bugs in the underground, but she never expected a black magician from the Black Magic Union to show up so openly.

"The Black Magic Union, huh..."

Thinking about it, it was funny. Whether black magicians or black wizards, they all had groups, but witches did not. Witches were born to live alone, making it impossible to form groups in the first place.

"This city is disgusting..."

Arcanium was now tiresome, but it was too late to leave. She had poured everything into this place, so she had no choice but to run the Witch's Restaurant with all her might until she died.

Tap, tap, tap!

"Let's go over there!"

"Yes, sir!"

"...Ugh!"

Hearing the shouts of some men from afar, Melisher quickly scattered an illusion to hide herself. She could kill them if she wanted, but in her current exhausted state, she couldn't handle the endless waves of the Stella Knights.

"Of all things, Stella is moving directly... How unlucky can I be?"

But it was okay. No magician could see through her illusion and find her location. 

"It's just that my range of movement has become a bit narrower. I'll move carefully and reopen the restaurant."

The Witch's Restaurant was already an existence made of imagination, so no matter how much the Stella Knights struggled, they couldn't catch her. Unless an irregular like a witch hunter intervened... she could attract students as much as she wanted.

"Besides, I hunted a witch hunter last time, so there's no problem now."

Thinking so, she stood up. Now... it was time to take a small step for a brilliant future.

* * *

Five days had passed since the terrorist incident at the Witch's Restaurant. During that time, the Stella Magic Investigation Team had used all sorts of advanced magical equipment to try to find any traces at the scene, but unfortunately, they found nothing. Considering that witches were mysterious beings, it was understandable.

What had I been doing all this time?

"...Hey, Baek Yuseol. How long are you going to stay like that? Why don't you do something?"

I had done nothing. I just waited at the scene of the incident. It was natural for the Stella Knights to get annoyed seeing me doing nothing.

"I'll report your behavior to Captain Arain after this incident. Do you think you're something just because you got a temporary knight title?"

"No."

How nice it would be if I were something. I had more to say to Arain. He had assigned me a bunch of useless idiots.

"Yawn..."

As I yawned, the knight clicked his tongue and walked away. Five hours later, as the sun was setting, the knights still hadn't found anything and eventually withdrew, leaving only minimal forces behind. Even as everyone left, I firmly stayed in place.

"Exactly five days."

The time it took for a witch hunter to resurrect from death.

人人人人...II

A dark mist rose from the scene of the incident, slowly forming a human-like shape in the air. After confirming that no one was watching, I approached it. And I knew my guess was right.

"...As expected."

-You... are...

"It's been a while, rookie witch hunter."

-...

I had encountered this witch hunter on the train before. He seemed to be a novice witch hunter.

"Did you get beaten by a witch?"

-Yes... It's embarrassing...

It was like a tiger hunting a rabbit and getting eaten instead. He had lost a fight he couldn't possibly lose. The witch hunter seemed quite dejected, his dark form slumping.

Meanwhile, I thought.

"This witch hunter is not the one from the original episode."

The witch hunter in the original episode had the trait [Breath of the Dead Witch]. Because of that trait, Eizel was pushed to the brink of death but was saved by Haewonryang and Mayuseong. But the witch hunter in front of me didn't have that trait. Instead, he had the trait [Return from Death Once, Five Days Later], which meant...

"...There is another witch hunter."

The witch hunter who attacked Eizel in the original game was a different person. This was a bad sign for me. I thought the witch hunter was dead, but that wasn't the case.

"Why are you here?"

-...I came because I heard you were hunting a witch here.

"So you tried to take the lead and got beaten? How pathetic."

The witch hunter's eyes dimmed as if he had nothing more to say.

"I told you before. It's not an easy witch to hunt. Why do you think I abandoned my honor and took on this human form?"

Pulling out the lie I had told before, it sounded quite convincing, and the witch hunter was at a loss for words.

-I'm sorry...

"Well, it doesn't matter. You're not completely dead, are you?"

The fact that he survived was purely the witch's mistake. The witch probably didn't know that witch hunters could defy death.

"I'll leave this place to you."

"Are you going back?"

-Yes... I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

"You know well. But are you just going to leave?"

-..?

Would I have waited here just to confirm that the witch hunter was alive? Of course not. I wanted to use the real witch hunter's help for an easy witch hunt. Although this guy didn't have the power to defeat the witch, all his abilities would give me a significant advantage in hunting witches.

"I'm planning to go after that witch's head. Don't you feel bad about just leaving after getting beaten by her?"

-That's true, but...

"Besides, you broke the strict taboo among witch hunters by betraying your kind."

-Wait. It's too much to say I broke the rules just because I targeted the prey!

"What? How old are you? I know a guy who got killed for stealing prey. Have you seen him?"

-...No.

"Then don't talk. I've seen it."

Actually, I haven't.

"Anyway, if you don't want to die, help me out for a bit. You have a hideout, right? Open it up. I need to get some tools."

-What about your subspace?

"I told you before. I lost it fighting a witch. Do you want me to say it twice?"

-...Okay. I'll open it.

Having been extorted by me before, he hesitated but had no choice. If the threat worked, he wouldn't resist anymore.

Crack! Wooong-!

The air split in half, revealing a dark subspace. I stepped in ahead of him, smiling slightly. Today seemed to be a lucky day.
