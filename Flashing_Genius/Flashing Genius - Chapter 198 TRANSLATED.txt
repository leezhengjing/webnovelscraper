# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy's Frontline Teleportation

## Chapter 198: Gambling with Time (1)

Clunk, clunk! When I rest my head against the window, the faint sound of the train rolling vibrates through my mind. Train travel is so romantic that when I look at the fantastic scenery passing by outside, I often lose myself without realizing it. Unlike Earth, Aether World has a variety of mysterious terrains and plants, so there was never a dull moment during the journey.

As I stared blankly out the window, I took out an envelope from my backpack. When I flipped it over, a simple handwritten phrase, "Tower of the Waning Moon," was written on it. The Tower of the Waning Moon. Even when I jumped into the world of ice to meet the Bronze December, the Tower of the Waning Moon seemed to show a persistent interest in me. This fact was quite burdensome. If the Tower of the Waning Moon became my ally, it would be reassuring, but if we became enemies, I might never be able to set foot on this land again.

At least for now, I am relieved. The leader of the 13th Extinction Squad, Kaen, seems to have a positive view of me. This "invitation" is proof of that. The Tower of the Waning Moon, hidden in the shadows of the world, is not a place just anyone can go. Even in the original game, Aether World Online, the "Invitation to the Tower of the Waning Moon" was one of the hardest items to obtain. Being invited to their headquarters is a sign that they trust me to some extent. I can now start to relax about this part.

Next, let's talk about the rewards I received for completing this episode.

* Strength increased by 49%
* Stamina increased by 21%
* Senses increased by 19%
* Cold-Blooded Limbs: All stats increase by 9% below -17°C, and you do not feel cold even in a blizzard, allowing free movement.
* Cold Energy: Mana can contain very pure and cold energy.
* Snow Trace: You can either leave no trace when stepping on snow or leave footprints in the snow.
* Memory of Snowflakes: You can recall traces left in the snow.
* Frost Ice: Consuming ice restores stamina, but you will suffer from high temperatures after recovery.

"A single snowflake that bloomed from the glacier of extinction will never wither."

I let out a short exclamation. Although it's only at the first stage, the stats are quite useful. To think I would already obtain two of the Twelve Divine Blessings, which can grant the best traits in the world just by obtaining one.

‘Still, I am quite weak.’

Among the community players, there were many who were quite tenacious, often trying to maximize their gains when they obtained something special. Some players had even achieved the highest level of the Bronze December's blessing, and I was quite surprised when I confirmed it at the time. There were bizarre abilities like rolling anything in the snow to create a snowball effect, causing a limited blizzard, and freezing entire small areas. When I met them on the PVP battlefield, I often lost because of their special ability to freeze my legs. Well, I eventually found a strategy and won more often later.

The rewards are not just these. Although this wasn't a main episode, by perfectly resolving a story close to the main one, I was promised two rewards from the Constellation Project. Including the one I hadn't received last time, I could choose three rewards in a row.

So, I thought about it.

"Wouldn't it be better to receive one better reward than to choose three separate ones?"

Due to narrative constraints, the rewards I can receive are limited. If I receive an item I used before, it might be heavily downgraded and not function properly. So, what if I combine the three rewards into one?

"Yes, yes. Consider it positively."

If I can combine the three rewards into one, what should I receive? I will have to think about this gradually.

‘I'm so tired.’

After organizing the reward issue, I stared blankly out the window again. Perhaps because the incident I experienced before was so intense and significant, the lingering feeling doesn't easily go away. Or maybe it's because of Hong Biyeon's strangely changed reaction lately.

‘Why is she acting like that these days?’

When I played Aether World Online, the characteristics of Hong Biyeon in my image were as follows:

1. A high schooler with no manners.
2. A princess with severe narcissism.
3. A villainess with a terrible personality.
4. Unnecessarily beautiful face.

Honestly, just looking at characteristics 1, 2, and 3, she was the epitome of unlikable, but because characteristic 4 was overwhelmingly strong, many male players, including myself, liked Hong Biyeon. She was so popular that she could rival other female characters who had all the narrative, personality, and looks. And now, even her personality and narrative seem to be catching up. Although she still has a sharp tongue, her personality has become strangely softer, and her mindset has naturally become as strong as steel through hardships and adversities.

‘This is driving me crazy.’

For some reason, I feel uneasy. Even though I overcame the most dangerous death flag that approached Hong Biyeon, it feels like an even bigger crisis is looming.

‘It must be just my imagination.’

Thinking that I should shake off unnecessary thoughts, I took out an eye mask from my pocket and put it on, then closed my eyes. From now on, I have to go to the Cradle of the Celestial Tree to resolve the curse of the Flower Queen, and I don't want to harm my mental health with trivial matters.

The summer vacation at Stella Academy is extremely boring. At least, that's what Pung Harang thinks. After all, he spends every day in classes just like during the semester. The summer vacation classroom is like an empty can. As the end of the vacation approaches, there are less than 20 students in a classroom that can accommodate 100.

"Hey, Pung Harang. Aren't you going back to your hometown for the vacation?"

Mack, who was staring intently at the back of the professor writing something on the blackboard, asked Pung Harang.

"Well, I don't think I'll see anything good if I go back."

"Really? I don't know about that since I'm a commoner. When my brother wore my new shoes and got them dirty, I wanted to kill him, but I didn't actually do it."

"Everyone has their own troubles."

First-year Class S, Pung Harang. As the youngest direct descendant of the Pung (Wind) family, which rules the entire Pungwol Plain in the south, he grew up under excessive scrutiny from his older brothers due to his outstanding talent. Usually, growing up in such an environment would make one's personality shrink, but he grew up with a stronger will, attracting many people around him. From commoners to Stella's professors and even the wizards of the Magic Tower, they all respected his opinions because he had a clear sense of self.

Even he had a recent concern.

"...Mack. What do you think?"

"Huh? About what?"

"Flame."

Since Pung Harang usually had a weighty presence, when he was deep in thought, female students would gush, "He must be worrying about the safety and development of his family!" Of course, no matter how much Pung Harang, he doesn't worry about such things every day. Sometimes, he worries about what to have for dinner, and sometimes he gets stressed by too much homework, just like any other student.

But still.

"You... think about girls too?"

Mack was shocked by Pung Harang's question, as he had always seen him as someone who treated girls like stones and rejected countless confessions.

"...Don't misunderstand. I'm asking out of pure curiosity."

"No, I mean, curiosity means you're interested in that girl, right?"

"...Is that so?"

"Yes! That's what it means."

"Then, don't you have any curiosity about Hazel, who you hang out with every day?"

"Curiosity, my foot. I wouldn't care if that crazy girl died on the street."

Pung Harang fell silent at Mack's words.

"Wow. The day you worry about girls has come... Well, Flame has been popular since the beginning of the semester."

As they whispered about Flame, suddenly, the back door of the classroom was torn off with a loud noise. Everyone in the classroom turned their gaze to the back door. There stood Flame, holding the torn door with one hand.

"...What is it this time, Flame?"

Since it wasn't the first time she caused trouble, the professor sighed and asked, and Flame awkwardly smiled and said,

"Well... I thought it was a hinged door, but it wouldn't open..."

"Ah."

The professor nodded as if he understood.

"So you forced open a sliding door?"

"Uh, yes..."

‘Is there any more absurd sound than this? A girl who tears off a sliding door by forcing it open with brute strength doesn't exist in this school, or anywhere in the world.’

"Uh... I'm sorry... I'll fix it..."

Even Flame seemed a bit embarrassed by her foolish act, so she awkwardly bowed her head and apologized before carrying the torn door and leaving.

"Why is she so funny?"

"Isn't she?"

Mack's question went unanswered as Pung Harang silently watched Flame's retreating figure.

‘The more I see her, the more unique she is.’

That was all he thought.

* * *

"Ah, this is so embarrassing..."

The door was completely destroyed, and when I took it to Stella's repair center, they said it would be better to replace it with a new one.

‘Did I push it that hard... I've been a bit dazed lately, so I often don't see things properly, but it wasn't this bad before. I don't know why this is happening.’

As I walked down the hallway, my gaze naturally fell on a newspaper posted prominently on the class bulletin board.

"Threat at the Coast of Levian"
"Disaster of Fire and Ice"
"Princess Hong Biyeon's Great Feat!"
"Controlling the Fire Spirit Flower for the First Time in a Thousand Years..."

It was all about Princess Hong Biyeon. Flame easily knew who was behind this public opinion.

‘Baek Yuseol. He did something again.’

The last time I saw Hong Biyeon, she was being dragged to the royal family, and it seemed like she would never return. But Baek Yuseol chased her there, resolved the disaster safely, and quietly disappeared.

She looked at the huge disaster in the newspaper... the "Pirate King Black Belize." The world was buzzing about the Ice Incarnation, but Flame knew well where it originated from. The Ice Incarnation came from the Bronze December. The Fire Incarnation came from the Red Summer. These were just fragments of the Twelve Divine Blessings. Yet, they created disasters that humans could hardly face, reminding her once again how great they were.

‘Is it the Twelve Divine Blessings again?’

Come to think of it, Baek Yuseol seemed to have an unusual obsession with the Twelve Divine Blessings. When they had a "fake date" at the library, he spent the whole day holding books related to the Twelve Divine Blessings, and he even took the obscure subject of Divine Studies.

‘Come to think of it...’

While walking absentmindedly, I found myself at the library. I came to return a book, but it seemed like the time was almost up as students were leaving one by one. After pushing the book into the return slot, I entered the library. The librarian immediately said, "No more borrowing," but it didn't matter. That wasn't my goal in the first place.

I walked slowly to the deep part of the library. Since it was late, there were hardly any students left, so I didn't have to worry about being seen. A little more. A little more inside. Stella's library has many secrets. It's so vast, and so vast, and so vast that it makes you think the visible size is all there is... but there is a hidden place.

[Magic Studies C36-48]

A place cleverly hidden in the shadows by the playful magic of Stella's principal, Elteman Eltewin. If you walk along that path, you will finally find such a space.

[Snow Flower]

A suspicious small bookstore with no marks or signs. Flame knew this place well. It was a part she had read repeatedly in the original romance novel.

Yes, that's right.

‘This was the episode where Angel searches for the truth about her father.’

Flame turned her head sharply.

"...Who, who are you?"

There stood Angel Morf, holding a book tightly to her chest and pointing a wand at me with a tense expression. She looked like a cat caught hiding in an alley, which was quite cute, but Flame didn't smile.

"Whew... I was surprised to see who it was. How did you know about this place?"

"Just... wandering around."

She lowered her eyes and looked at the book Angel was holding. The title was partially covered, but it was easy to identify the book.

‘Silver Age November’

It was the starting point of a tragic story that would eventually drive a girl named Angel into the abyss.
