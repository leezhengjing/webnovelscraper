# I Became a Genius in the Blink of an Eye at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 157: The Orb of Souls (1)

As the latter half of the match progressed, each battle became increasingly intriguing. Although many top contenders had been eliminated, new rising stars, both boys and girls, showcased outstanding performances.

"Ah~ Edelria has been eliminated! Her bold decision to abandon cover and charge was commendable, but luck was not on her side. There was a venomous trap right there!"

With each elimination, sighs of regret echoed from all around, while some cheered in excitement. The commentator swiftly scanned the stage, checking each battle and skillfully narrating multiple scenes simultaneously. Occasionally, the commentator would focus on a single battle, especially when it involved particularly notable contestants that drew the majority of the audience's attention.

"A strong contender for the championship, Zeliel, has started a battle with Baroncal!"

In truth, few knew the name Baroncal. However, Zeliel was globally renowned, attracting significant interest. The commentator quickly shifted focus to their battle. It was unfortunate that other battles were sidelined, but as a commentator, one had to cater to the audience's preferences.

"The battle has begun! Although Baroncal is not well-known, his domineering aura suggests that Zeliel should not underestimate him!"

The commentator tried to elevate the atmosphere by highlighting Baroncal, but most expected Zeliel to win. Despite knowing the likely outcome, the audience was eager to witness the skills of Zeliel, who had become a high elf at a young age. They anticipated what spectacular magic she would display to crush her unknown opponent.

The battle commenced, but...

"Ah... wait, it seems there's a problem during the match..."

"What? What's that?"

"Isn't that really burning?"

"Something's off..."

"Is there an error in the Stella Dome?"

As the terrain began to burn due to the crimson flames wielded by Baroncal, the audience murmured in confusion. The anxiety heightened when Zeliel's skin visibly charred from the magic.

The Magic Survival stage was a virtual space, designed to prevent any real harm from magic. So why was such an inexplicable phenomenon occurring?

"What's wrong?"

"I don't know... Of course, ordinary people who are not well-versed in magic might not notice anything wrong."

"There are objects on the stage that cannot be destroyed by the contestants' magic, like falling rain or fixed building piles."

"Yeah, so what?"

"That Baroncal is burning all those objects while attacking Zeliel. It seems like she's genuinely injured."

"Right. Moreover, those black flames seem to contain dark magic."

"What... really?"

Among the audience were many knowledgeable magicians. They noticed the oddity of the match and spread the word, leading to widespread speculation that a dark magician had infiltrated the survival game.

"Ah, everyone, please calm down. It seems there's a minor accident, but the Stella team will handle it..."

The commentator received a signal to switch the monitor but refused. With decades of experience, the commentator knew that switching the screen during such a controversy would only exacerbate the situation.

"For now, let's observe the situation..."

As the commentator tried to calm the atmosphere, Zeliel finally fell, her body engulfed in flames from Baroncal's magic.

"Ah... the situation is escalating uncontrollably."

* * *

At that time, in Flame's hospital room.

Hong Biyeon, who was watching the same situation, suddenly spoke.

"The root of Iskaram."

"Eh...?"

Anella looked puzzled by the sudden remark, and Flame provided an explanation from behind.

"It's the source of that magic. It's related to the bloodline of dark magicians, allowing them to wield special magic."

"Ah, right..."

Anella, being a dark magician herself, couldn't be unaware. 'Iskaram' was one of the most powerful and notorious dark magicians.

"Unbelievable... A dark magician presumed to be much younger than me can wield such tyrannical power."

Anella, unable to perform such feats herself, felt a twinge of envy but quickly composed herself.

"I no longer envy the power of dark magicians."

While Anella shook her head, Flame watched the monitor with a serious expression. Baroncal, using Iskaram's magic, was likely aware that he was exposed to thousands of spectators. But he would probably enjoy it, deriving pleasure from tormenting and killing a figure idolized by magicians. Even if he were to die immediately afterward, leaving a significant scar on the magical world would be worth it.

The commentator fell silent. On the screen, Zeliel struggled to crawl out of her summoned creature, Elpion, but her body was severely burned, making further combat impossible. In contrast, Baroncal remained unscathed.

The situation was becoming increasingly complex. In the original novel, Zeliel was undoubtedly a villain. She and Hong Biyeon, who stood in stark contrast to Angel, tormented the protagonist in various ways, making her an unforgettable character.

Thus, the dilemma arose.

"Is it okay for Zeliel to die?"

She was a significant figure in this world, capable of overturning a city with a single word. If such a person were suddenly erased due to an unexpected variable, wouldn't it accelerate the impending 'world destruction'?

Amidst the confusion...

Boom...!!

A massive lightning bolt struck within the screen door, and Baek Yuseol appeared simultaneously. He had chosen to save Zeliel.

"Ah, um... Zeliel has been eliminated..."

Baek Yuseol safely eliminated her, and as the battle ensued, Flame watched the scene with bated breath. To prevent further harm to the contestants, the dark magician had to be dealt with directly.

Despite the grave situation...

"Yes! Baek Yuseol! Kill him!"

"Well done! Show him what you're made of!"

Cheers erupted from the audience. It was only natural, given that Baek Yuseol had not only dramatically rescued Zeliel but also single-handedly eliminated numerous contestants with overwhelming combat power.

"What will happen next...?"

In the original novel, the incident of a dark magician infiltrating Stella caused an uproar. It was a story that unfolded after the inter-school competition when Professor Maizen Tiren turned into a dark magician. However, Maizen Tiren had long been defeated by Baek Yuseol, and it seemed the matter had been quietly resolved...

"Ah..."

In the midst of this, something peculiar emanated from Baek Yuseol. It was familiar but not something one would sense from a human.

"This is... the power of a divine beast?"

"Why? Is there a problem?"

Hong Biyeon, unaware of the situation, asked with a puzzled expression. Only someone with exceptionally keen senses like Flame could notice it.

"...No, nothing."

Flame shook his head. He was merely surprised that Baek Yuseol could wield the power of a divine beast. As a regressor, it wasn't entirely unexpected.

"Why do I feel so uneasy?"

At the Stella Dome stage, in a space completely isolated from the outside, Ggot Seorin frowned upon seeing the dark magician's revealed identity. Was she upset because a dark magician had suddenly infiltrated the Magic Survival? That was part of it, as she particularly despised dark magicians. However, she was also disappointed that the dark magician's identity wasn't what she had hoped for.

"Ah?"

Then, upon seeing the boy facing Baroncal, Ggot Seorin's expression turned blank. It was a familiar face. How could she not recognize him? That student was the mysterious boy who had saved the life of the divine spirit, Yiphanel.

"Why do you ask?"

Orenha inquired, but Ggot Seorin, entranced, continued to scrutinize Baek Yuseol's face. There was no doubt. He was the boy she had encountered in Yiphanel's garden.

"He was a student at Stella... To think he was so close, yet I couldn't meet him. It felt somewhat futile, but she was relieved. After the match, she could meet him. Perhaps she could even inquire about Yiphanel, who had fallen asleep to recover his energy. However, she was also anxious because the divine spirit slayer's presence was nowhere to be seen.

"You're anxious."

Orenha smiled subtly. Ggot Seorin, still unable to see the divine spirit slayer, touched her lips. Despite the mask preventing her from properly touching her lips, she didn't realize her habit, indicating her anxiety. She glanced at Orenha, seemingly wanting to ask something but decided to wait a bit longer and turned her attention back to the screen. Ggot Seorin trusted Orenha greatly. Otherwise, she wouldn't have entrusted him with most of the king's duties. Since Orenha had mentioned the divine spirit slayer, she decided to trust and wait, silently watching the match.

"Your Majesty, the magicians of Stella are moving busily. It seems to be a real situation."

"That dark magic is not fake."

Some ordinary spectators believed the dark magician's intrusion was an event. They couldn't feel the dreadful and disgusting dark magic, a blessing in disguise. Ggot Seorin, who was suffering from the stench, wanted to cut off her nose.

"But seeing that they can't immediately intervene, it seems the rumor that Stella's headmaster can't control his own magic is true."

Ggot Seorin didn't respond but thought it was inevitable. The essence of the spatial magic used by Eltman Eltwin was derived from someone else. Having severed ties with his mentor, who had taught him magic, he couldn't fix any issues with his magic. The spatial equation was beyond human comprehension, and Eltman Eltwin's magic was forever stuck in place.

Ggot Seorin silently observed the entire stage. Although she now knew that Baroncal was a dark magician, who could say there wasn't another one? Unless a special dark magic was used to conceal the dark magic, even Ggot Seorin couldn't detect it. However, she would notice the moment any magic leaked out. Her gaze naturally focused on the battle between Baroncal and Baek Yuseol. Baroncal's unique dark magic wasn't particularly special, having seen the original version long ago, but Baek Yuseol was very unique.

"Isn't he fascinating? This student named Baek Yuseol."

"...Yes. Truly unique and special."

She had heard his name countless times. At the young age of seventeen, he had already created two groundbreaking spells. Moreover, he was said to control teleportation. For Ggot Seorin, who believed it was impossible to control teleportation with ordinary magic, it was astonishing.

"...But, Your Majesty. Haven't you ever thought about it?"

"Yes...?"

"What if Baek Yuseol is not an ordinary teenager... Wouldn't all his achievements seem plausible?"

"What do you mean?"

"It may sound sudden, but I believe so. Many great magicians in history have created such remarkable spells."

Firendart created pureblood magic at thirty-nine, Arazest developed reverse casting at fifty-four, ensuring 100% stability in magic, and Quintum perfectly condensed the essence of magical elements at forty. Baek Yuseol's achievements were similar to theirs, but his young age made him stand out.

"His age is the issue. Baek Yuseol... is disguising his age."

"...What are you saying?"

Ggot Seorin found it hard to believe. But Orenha continued with conviction.

"Your Majesty knows why I'm saying this."

"That is..."

She was about to ask what he meant when suddenly, a strong... divine beast's aura was felt from somewhere.

Startled, Ggot Seorin found herself already standing. The familiar and nostalgic aura belonged to none other than her old friend, the divine spirit Yiphanel. And that divine beast's power was emanating from the student named Baek Yuseol.

"How...?"

She knew he had saved Yiphanel. But how could he possess Yiphanel's aura? For an ordinary human to hold such an immense aura, they would have to 'kill a divine spirit and consume its heart,' which was impossible. But Yiphanel had clearly stated that the boy had saved him.

"Ah..."

Seeing Ggot Seorin's increasingly complex thoughts, Orenha stood up and gently placed his hands on her shoulders.

"Your Majesty, I didn't bring this up without reason. I have... solid evidence."

"Evidence?"

"Yes. I apologize for keeping it a secret, but... I had Baek Yuseol carry the 'Orb of Souls.' Today marks exactly one month."

"So, through the Orb of Souls, we can determine if Baek Yuseol's soul has been corrupted. If he truly killed a divine spirit, a pitch-black pearl will appear. Although she didn't want to believe it, Ggot Seorin had no choice but to listen to Orenha. She closed her eyes tightly and nodded.

"...Alright. Quietly summon Baek Yuseol."

"Yes, understood."

Indeed, she was a benevolent queen. Even in this situation, she planned to verify the truth quietly. Orenha thought so but had no intention of following her orders. He felt sorry for her, but he intended to reveal Baek Yuseol's identity to the world.
