### I Became a Genius in Front of the Magic School 186

#### 42. Isolation (4)

The capital of Adolevit, Tehalan, is quite a famous tourist city. This is because you can see the 'Frost Cliff Palace' from anywhere in the city. The grand palace, standing tall on a sharply cut cliff in the distance, exuded an overwhelming sense of majesty just by looking at it. It was certainly a magnificent city. Sitting at an outdoor café on the street, sipping a drink while gazing at the distant palace, I felt a sense of charm.

The streets of Tehalan reminded me of London in the 19th-20th century. The dark black trains crossing the city, the gentlemen and ladies who enjoyed wearing suits, the gray-tinted sky and buildings. It felt like Sherlock Holmes might pop out from the alley over there, chasing Jack the Ripper with Watson.

If you ask what I plan to do here, of course, my first thought is to infiltrate that palace. Naturally, sneaking into such a heavily guarded palace with just a blink is akin to a suicide mission. Although I don't have mana in my body, based on my past experiences, wizards would detect mana reactions the moment I use blink, and the security system would also detect it.

However, there are not only covert and criminal ways to infiltrate the Frost Palace. A moral and legal way... For instance, how about becoming a palace official myself? There are less than 2-3 weeks left of the summer vacation, and I need to rescue Hong Biyeon within that time. Becoming a palace official might seem daunting and impossible, but for me, it's easier than it seems. I had the 'Magpie Glasses' that meticulously recorded many ongoing events.

First, I sought out the most famous trading company in Tehalan, 'Cheonri Trading Company.'

"Um? A student from Stella. What brings you here?"

"Hello."

The office of Cheonri Trading Company was more like a factory than an office. Dozens of gigantic automatic carriages, as big as trucks, were waiting, and men were loading and unloading goods. Among them, people were managing and directing the operations. I mingled with them.

"I heard that recently, there has been a shortage of Antaryl Oilers, causing difficulties. I happen to be very skilled in handling Antaryl Oilers. May I offer my assistance?"

I said confidently, but...

"What are you talking about? We have plenty of Antaryl Oiler technicians. That guy over there is also an Antaryl technician, but there are so many technicians that he's doing loading and unloading now."

Failure. The Magpie Glasses were not omnipotent, of course. They didn't specify exactly when and where events would occur, and countless butterfly effects would occur worldwide based on my actions, leading to different futures. Naturally, I didn't expect to succeed on the first try.

I continued to search all over Tehalan. Newspaper offices, weapon shops, magic tool specialty stores, etc. After repeated failures, I finally found a place in trouble, as noted in the Magpie Glasses. 'Sunset Bookstore.' Although it was called a bookstore, it was practically a publishing house, one of the suppliers that continuously provided books to the Adolevit royal family. Recently, a problem arose. The books already supplied to the royal family must not be supplied again until requested, and they had to be meticulously checked and managed. However, the managing librarian recently ran away, causing a headache.

If the librarian had simply run away, it wouldn't have been a big problem, but they had completely messed up the related documents, making it difficult to meet deadlines.

"I'm really good at organizing these things."

"...Really? Well, give it a try."

The bookstore owner seemed skeptical, but thanks to the power of the Stella mark, I was hired as a daily part-timer. And within a day, I managed to organize everything neatly.

"How...?"

"I'm quite skilled."

The document organization itself wasn't much. It was a laborious process, but I organized the documents one by one, then read them all. Of course, I didn't read them myself; I made the Magpie Glasses read them. Then, the Magpie Glasses, which stored the contents of all the documents, categorized them in order, and I just had to gather them accordingly. The volume was enormous, so I had to skip meals all day, but thanks to me, Sunset Bookstore could successfully supply books to Adolevit, making it a rewarding task.

"This is great. We needed someone to fill the librarian's position. You said you'd work during the summer vacation, right? We're planning to deliver books to the royal family the day after tomorrow. Would you like to come along? Your help would be greatly appreciated."

Of course, not just anyone could enter the palace; one needed a sufficiently guaranteed status. But wasn't the Stella student ID a significant status? Although not as grand as the royal family, it was enough to be called a 'first-class citizen,' so there was no major obstacle to entry. Having come this far, half the battle was won. Although I hadn't become a palace official yet, according to my plan, probably...

"Oh, did you organize all this by yourself?"

"Haha. Isn't it amazing? But what's more amazing is that we did nothing, and this student did it all alone."

As the Sunset Bookstore owner patted my back, the royal library's librarian's eyes sparkled.

"Did you say you were a part-timer? Your observation and memory are impressive. Your personality is very meticulous and delicate."

"Thank you."

"So, the thing is, the manager is down with a severe flu... The librarian grandpa said, pretending to be cautious.

"I'll pay you generously. How about working for the summer?"

As expected, or rather, as noted in the Magpie Glasses. The royal library's manager was suffering from a chronic illness, so they were short-handed. In such a situation, a competent librarian appeared... How could they not hire me?

"Yes, of course."

Thus, I successfully got a job at the Frost Palace. Working at the palace didn't mean I could immediately meet Hong Biyeon. My role was to manage third-class books in the royal library, which didn't involve confidential matters. Since I wasn't a citizen of Adolevit and was just a traveler, I couldn't even access second-class books like national magic books. But that didn't mean I had nothing to do. In fact, there was so much work that it drove me crazy.

The royal library was in such a mess that it raised fundamental questions about whether a person could really organize it. The scale was unnecessarily large, and it took over a week to organize everything.

"To think you really organized this. Impressive."

"Hey, librarian. Is that kid the one you mentioned?"

"Yes, isn't he amazing?"

"Hmm..."

Even then, administrative officials and noble managers, who heard the rumors, started eyeing me. I hoped the librarian would block them, but unfortunately, he didn't have much power.

"Hey, if you have time, could you help me? I have a mountain of documents to organize, and it's really tough."

"Sure."

I had planned to live quietly as a simple librarian, but I ended up being called here and there, doing administrative work. I wasn't a citizen of Adolevit, nor a noble, nor even an official palace member, so I didn't know what they were relying on. Well, considering the Korean military, which would even bring in stray dogs to use them if they had any use, this was mild.

Still, these tasks weren't all bad. Although I wasn't an official palace member, I could get close to noble palace members, especially the maids, who were very sensitive to rumors, allowing me to hear internal royal stories.

"Did you hear? The Queen is going on vacation with the princesses."

"Of course, I heard. They're going to 'Leviang's Coast.'"

"Well, it's called a vacation, but..."

Through the maids' conversations, I finally confirmed that this situation was indeed the story I knew. It was an extra episode, not a main one. But as I mentioned before, the 'Twelve Zodiac' entities, which are presumed to be the most important keywords for leading this world to the correct ending, rarely appear in the main episodes and can only be encountered by progressing through side stories. For that reason, I dare say this episode is more important than any story so far. At Leviang's Coast, where winter never ends, the Twelve Zodiac, Qingdong Shiyue (青冬十二月), is asleep.

'I didn't expect to progress this so soon... But eventually, I must meet the Twelve Zodiac. Although it feels a bit early, given the situation, I must do my best.'

"...Princess. I'm sorry."

Hong Biyeon listened silently to her escort knight, Yeterin, with her lips tightly closed. Yeterin, who had always spent time with her in the same space since she was a child, was like her closest friend and protector. In this dreadful palace where everyone was hostile to her, Yeterin was one of the few people she could trust. Such Yeterin was being dispatched. Wasn't it absurd? Sending the princess's escort knight away. But since Queen Hong Seryu had personally approved it, it couldn't be overturned. Even until the last moment of packing and leaving, Yeterin couldn't hide her regretful eyes.

If it were usual, Hong Biyeon would have said something, but today, she was unusually silent and couldn't say anything.

"Princess..."

Even though Yeterin called, Hong Biyeon didn't respond. No, she couldn't. If she opened her mouth here, she felt she might say something she couldn't take back. Yeterin approached her slowly and whispered softly.

"Princess, even without me... you can do well. The princess I've seen has always moved forward without collapsing to anything."

"I promise to quickly finish my mission and return to protect you again."

After saying that, Yeterin stepped back, and only then could Hong Biyeon nod. She didn't make a sad face. There were still many eyes watching. 'I must not show weakness.' She always had to show a strong side. If she showed weakness, she would be looked down upon instantly. Although she was at the top of the food chain, she was also prey targeted by all predators.

After Yeterin left, another person took over as Hong Biyeon's escort knight. She didn't know his name or status, but she was sure of one thing. 'He is not on my side.' The man with short hair and a hard, cold impression looked at Hong Biyeon with disapproving eyes. It wasn't a gaze one could direct at royalty, but she couldn't touch him recklessly. He was... someone the Queen had personally assigned.

...Night fell. Hong Biyeon, in her underwear, went out to the balcony and looked at the moonlight. The full moon shining brightly seemed resentful. What was so good that it was smiling so brightly? As she stared blankly at the sky, she thought of her sister who had left long ago. She used to lie on the hill with her sister, always looking at the stars.

'Have you ever seen a meteor shower?'

At that time, I shook my head.

'It's when the sun completely sets, saying goodbye to today and facing the sky.'

It was past midnight. No one was looking for me, so I climbed the hill with my sister at dawn, and no one stopped us.

'On a clear day without clouds, lay down a mat and lie down... and embrace the sky in your arms. At the moment you see the meteor shower, you will be the freest in the world.'

...My sister was wrong. I had become someone who could no longer be free. What did a meteor shower matter? I felt lonely, desolate, and isolated. I knew the unfamiliar feeling of not being lonely. I knew the feeling of relying on and leaning on someone. This emotion dug deeper into Hong Biyeon's heart. There was no one left in the Frost Palace to take her side. Even those who had protected her had all left. She was alone. Trapped in the palace alone. Praying in solitude for a lifetime. She would wither away like that.

Hong Biyeon leaned weakly against the balcony and closed her eyes. Receiving the consolation of the pouring starlight...

'Ah.'

At that moment, she felt something strange and unfamiliar but not entirely unknown on her cheek, and she opened her eyes. She absentmindedly touched her cheek with her hand, but there was nothing. 'This is...' On second thought, it wasn't a physical sensation. It was the sixth sense, the mana, that felt a familiar scent. In the dead of night, when everyone was asleep, Hong Biyeon quietly left her room and walked down the corridor. She didn't know where she was heading, just following the familiar scent. Walking. And walking. After passing several corridors and leaving the palace, she finally arrived at a place she could call her destination. It was... the library. The royal library. It was the first time since she entered Stella, so it had been half a year since she came here.

'Why here...?'

She couldn't understand why she came here, but she opened the library door without thinking. She thought it would be locked at this hour, but strangely, it was open. Creak...! The old door, which hadn't been oiled, opened, revealing the inside of the library. The smell of books was strong, but it wasn't unpleasant. There was no sign of people. But she confirmed that the lights were on inside the library, so she cautiously took out her wand and headed there. Immediately, a loud noise was heard. Thud! Thump!

"Ugh!"

It was the sound of something collapsing.

'What...!'

Hong Biyeon hurriedly ran to where the noise came from. There, a bookshelf had fallen sideways, scattering dozens of books, and someone was struggling under it.

"Who-"

Just as she was about to ask who it was, a boy popped out from between the books and revealed his face. ...At that moment, Hong Biyeon almost had a heart attack. She thought this might be a dream and unconsciously held her breath.

"Oh my, I'm dying... That damn librarian, just wait until I go to work tomorrow..."

Baek Yuseol, who was grumbling while removing the books, turned his head and met eyes with Hong Biyeon, who was staring at him blankly in her pajamas.

"Oh."

A moment of silence. Then, Baek Yuseol awkwardly smiled and said.

"Hey... Instead of just staring, why don't you come and help? Neighbors should help each other, right-"

Thud!

"...Huh?"

But Hong Biyeon sat down on the spot, and Baek Yuseol couldn't finish his sentence.

"How, how are you here...?"

"Well, just. As a part-time job."

He pointed his thumb behind him.

"See? I organized all that. Impressive, right? I'm quite skilled at this."

Despite his effort to boast, Hong Biyeon didn't even glance at the place he pointed to. She stared at him without blinking, as if she would lose him if she looked away even for a moment.

"Part-time... job...?"

"That's right."

Heh, heh...

She laughed. But strangely, her expression was crying.

"Liar..."

She lowered her head.

"Who wouldn't know it's a lie... you stupid commoner..."

"Ahem! It's not a lie. Even if a bit of MSG was added. Instant food tastes good..."

"Don't look this way."

"What?"

Hong Biyeon covered her face with both hands. From then on, Baek Yuseol was genuinely flustered and couldn't say anything properly. His lips couldn't move as if they were stuck. He had no idea she would react so intensely, so Baek Yuseol really... couldn't do anything.

Night deepened. It was a night when the stars shone exceptionally brightly.
