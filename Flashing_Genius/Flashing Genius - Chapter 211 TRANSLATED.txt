### Chapter 211: The Old Story (7)

Jellyel could confidently assert that this was far more difficult and grueling than when she had previously led an expedition to explore ancient ruins. Naturally, it had to be. This place, the "Silent Maze Forest," was, according to Baek Yuseol's terminology, a "high-level field." Therefore, it might be a more familiar place for Baek Yuseol. Low-level fields could be overpowered with items and levels, but high-level fields couldn't be conquered that way. The only way to easily break through such an extreme field was to study, familiarize, and repeatedly confront it, facing death countless times until one mastered it.

Low-level mages couldn't even hear sounds in this place, and even those with some level of skill would completely lose their sense of direction. Exploring the Silent Maze Forest made it clear that mental strength was more important than physical stamina. With light barely seeping in, making it difficult to secure visibility, powerful monsters would suddenly emerge from the hazy fog. One couldn't afford to relax for even a moment, as a slight lapse in vigilance could lead to disaster.

"Over here."

Fortunately, they didn't have to wander aimlessly through the forest. They had a clear guidepost. Following Baek Yuseol's special compass, the expedition team easily penetrated deep into the forest. Even in unexpected situations that flustered veteran mages, Baek Yuseol calmly led the team. Of course, he didn't forget to subtly retreat when monsters appeared. Honestly, with his current skills, he couldn't even scratch the monsters here.

"Kieeeek-!!"

"What, what was that?"

"What was that sound?"

As they passed a ridge obscured by thick fog, a high-pitched scream echoed from somewhere, but Baek Yuseol spoke as if it was nothing to worry about.

"It's a Mist Predator."

"Mist... Predator? What's that? It's not even in the bestiary."

The Maze Forest had never been properly explored, so the bestiary didn't have accurate records. But Baek Yuseol's mind was filled with information about this place.

"The fog surrounding the Maze Forest is due to the super-giant monster 'Mistry' located at the forest's center. It exhales fog containing narcotic substances, and the creatures that live off it are the Mist Predators. It's a positive sign. When predators are nearby, your senses start to return to some extent."

"Oh... I see."

"Now that you mention it, I can see better than before."

"Right. It was hard to even have a conversation earlier, but now we can hear each other clearly."

"Let's proceed quickly. The predators will soon return to their feeding."

As he said, the Mist Predators soon disappeared. Everyone simultaneously wondered, 'How does he know such things?' but no one questioned it. The expedition ventured deeper into the forest, and soon the fog became so thick that they couldn't see an inch ahead.

Suddenly, the fog cleared.

...The ruins appeared.

The ancient ruins of Karmenset.

"Ah...!"

"Finally...!"

Everyone let out small exclamations. Though it was a short time, the Maze Forest was truly a dreadful place. Feeling a sense of relief, the expedition slowly walked towards the ruins. But something felt off.

"Didn't they say it was moved recently?"

The ancient ruins of Karmenset were a "shifting dungeon" whose location changed constantly, making it hard to find. But look at this.

"These traces... It's as if they've been here for thousands of years, blending into the surroundings."

Vines from trees hundreds of years old surrounded the ruins, and the moss and weathered marks on the ruins were not recent. The mages felt a deep curiosity about this mysterious phenomenon. The answer came quickly. Baek Yuseol, who had been staring at the ruins, spoke up.

"Yesterday, I said the 'Spiral Time Theory' was wrong."

"Huh? You did. Because it appeared in a different location after two weeks."

"I was wrong. The doctor was right. The ancient ruins of Karmenset have transcended not only space but also time to move themselves."

"What... What did you say?"

"Perhaps the place it moved to was the Maze Forest thousands of years ago. It has remained intact here since then."

"No way... Spatial movement has become so common that it's no longer surprising, but... 'Time travel' is an area that magic has yet to conquer, let alone approach."

Feeling an insurmountable barrier, everyone fell silent, including Haeseongwol. Even a 9th-class mage couldn't control time.

'It's astonishing.'

...In fact, Baek Yuseol had known about this 'setting' from the beginning. He had pretended not to know yesterday because it was pointless to mention it in advance.

'Time travel.'

In the world of Aether, beings that could manipulate time were extremely rare. No, in fact, Eunsesipilwol was practically the only one. But since Eunsesipilwol, as one of the Twelve Gods, could bestow 'blessings,' it wasn't impossible for a being to interfere with time. Karmenset, who lived in ancient times, was one such example. Once blessed by Eunsesipilwol but stripped of that power, he became a pitiful soul wandering forever. However, even after losing his power, he trained himself to the extreme and eventually learned to interfere with time without the blessing.

"Let's go in. I'll follow from here. There are more experts for exploring the ruins."

"Alright... We'll take the lead."

Baek Yuseol, who had led the expedition so far, didn't need to do so in the ruins. The ruins were filled with numerous magical traps, mechanisms, and puzzles. One had to think quickly to proceed to the next stage, and a moment's mistake could be fatal. But as expected of veterans, not a single casualty occurred. Unlike Jellyel's Starcloud Expedition, which had to proceed slowly and suffer some damage, they achieved a completely different result.

"...We've arrived."

Haeseongwol looked at the massive door in front of him with a complicated expression. Beyond this door awaited the vengeful spirit of ancient Karmenset.

"Is this really the right thing to do...?"

Using Karmenset to stop the disaster caused by Karmenset, was that really okay? He didn't know. But there was no other way, so they couldn't back out now.

"I'll go in alone."

"Chess is my...广"

"No. I'll go."

Jellyel hurriedly reached out, but Baek Yuseol shook his head.

"You met Karmenset before and won, right?"

"Your pattern has already been read. The opponent is the God of Chess."

"No way..."

Jellyel had won before because she was familiar with Karmenset's chess strategy. She had run simulations thousands of times to strategize against him, so it was only natural she won. But now it was different. The God of Chess had thoroughly analyzed her pattern. Could she win against such an opponent? Impossible.

"Then, can you win?"

Baek Yuseol smirked and forcefully opened the door leading to Karmenset.

"Have you already forgotten who taught you chess?"

"Ah...!"

Creak—Boom!

The heavy iron door opened effortlessly, revealing two red lights floating in the air. It was undoubtedly someone's gaze. The vengeful spirit of Karmenset spoke in a chilling voice, its eyes glowing.

"...A great and noble soul has come. What is the reason for waking me?"

"Shut up and set up the chessboard."

Even in the face of an ancient being, Baek Yuseol's blunt words left the mages of the Full Moon Tower speechless. Karmenset, too, seemed taken aback by such an unprecedented situation.

"Foolish one. Showing such disrespect will not benefit you."

"What are you talking about? You're terrible at chess. I don't use honorifics for those worse than me."

"...This won't do."

Rumble!!

As the ground began to shake, the mages waiting at the door stepped back. The ground beneath Baek Yuseol's feet quickly turned black and white, forming a giant chessboard. Huge chess pieces fell with a heavy thud, but the 'King' position was vacant.

"You will be the King and play Soul Chess with me. If you win, I will grant your wish, but if you lose, your soul will be mine."

"Yeah, I know."

As Baek Yuseol nodded, signaling the start of the chess game...

Rumble!!!

A sudden loud noise shook the entire ruins.

"Ah?"

"What's happening?"

"Ugh... The ground is shaking so much it's hard to keep balance."

The mages used their magic to stabilize themselves, and Baek Yuseol quickly drew his sword and lowered his stance.

'What's going on?'

Even he hadn't anticipated such an unexpected situation.

"...This is bad. It seems 'Mistry' has started to move."

Looking towards the exit of the ruins, Haeseongwol frowned.

"M-Mistry?"

"Yes."

Mistry was said to be active once every hundred years, usually lying dormant but occasionally waking up and causing a ruckus, overturning the terrain. It was such a rare occurrence that no one paid much attention to it, but of all times, Mistry had to wake up now.

"Baek Yuseol, return."

"...Tower Master!"

Haeseongwol made a cold judgment.

"If we don't evacuate, we could be caught in a catastrophe. I can handle normal terrain collapses, but you know well what happens if we get caught in the collapse of a 'spatial dungeon,' right?"

Of course. If caught in a dungeon collapse, one could be annihilated on the spot. But... this place was different. As mentioned before, the ruins of Karmenset were not a spatial dungeon but the world's only 'temporal dungeon.' Perhaps, even if caught, they might not be annihilated.

"No. I'll stay here and play chess. Please lead the expedition to safety."

"...You're insane."

"I have no choice. It's a miracle that a temporal dungeon exists twice in the same era. If we lose the ruins of Karmenset now, we may never find Chairman Melian again."

After finishing his words, Baek Yuseol turned back to face Karmenset.

Rumble!!

Even as they calmly conversed, the dungeon continued to shake violently.

"Tower Master!"

"We must evacuate!"

Haeseongwol briefly watched Baek Yuseol's back. He could have used his magic to forcibly drag Baek Yuseol out and hope for the future, but he didn't.

"Let's go back."

"Ah...!"

As soon as Haeseongwol spoke, the expedition hurriedly began to evacuate the dungeon. It might seem cold-hearted, but staying behind to wait for Baek Yuseol wasn't a sign of affection; it was a foolish act. As the mages frantically exited the dungeon, the Soul Chess between Karmenset and Baek Yuseol began. Turning his back on them, Haeseongwol leisurely walked away. Or at least, he tried to.

"...Jellyel."

If it weren't for a girl who stayed behind to watch Baek Yuseol's chess game.

"Go back first. I'll stay here and watch Baek Yuseol's chess game to the end."

"No. You can't."

"This is a fight to find my father. I can't go back... Ugh!"

Before Jellyel could finish her sentence, Haeseongwol placed his hand on her forehead. Her strength gradually faded, making it impossible for her to resist. Despite her trembling body, she tried to move, but she couldn't muster any strength. She looked at Haeseongwol with resentful eyes, but he didn't care.

"Sorry. Your father wouldn't want you to die like this."

From the beginning, she had no decision-making power. Haeseongwol never intended to let Jellyel do anything dangerous. Leading the completely weakened Jellyel out with magic, Haeseongwol never looked back.

'...It's bitter.'

A genius boy who had been impressive from their first meeting. Although he couldn't use magic, he might have become a great mage leading the world in the future.

'It's a pity to lose such talent.'

Leading the struggling Jellyel, Haeseongwol was the last to leave the ruins.

...Whoosh!

At that moment, the ruins of Karmenset completely disappeared, vanishing from the world.

"Ah...!"

Thud.

Seeing this, Jellyel collapsed to the ground. Her empty eyes stared at the ruins' remnants for a long time... but nothing remained there anymore.
