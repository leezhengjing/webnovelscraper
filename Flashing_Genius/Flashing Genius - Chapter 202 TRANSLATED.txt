# The Genius Who Became a Blink in Front of the Magic School

## Chapter 202: A Gamble with Time (5)

Shwaa!! The rain poured down steadily.

-...So, you're saying you're enjoying your summer vacation?

"Yes. It's a complete vacation."

I reported my current location to Instructor Yi Hanwol of Class S, who was still leading a busy life at Stella Academy. When a Stella cadet is dispatched or on vacation, it is mandatory to send a letter once a week. However, with the help of Hwaseorin, I was able to report conveniently through a call. Some might find calls more inconvenient, but I am quite adept at lying, so it wasn't a problem.

- I see. Have you been doing well without any issues?

Yi Hanwol also knows. Recently, I had invaded the Kingdom of Adolevit and caused some unusual events. However, since there were no reports about me in the newspapers or other media, it was awkward to mention it.

Because.

"Yes. I was enjoying a suntan while drinking cola... not champagne, by the beach."

-...I see.

He must have some suspicions. But just as you can't throw someone in jail without concrete evidence, I had a very clean alibi. The third princess of Adolevit, the protagonist of this incident, would vouch for my alibi. What could Yi Hanwol do about that?

- Be careful and have fun before you return.

Yi Hanwol ended the call there, and I felt a bit relieved. I felt sorry for him, but I had no intention of returning immediately.

"Are you leaving now?"

"Yes."

Hwaseorin seemed to hesitate, her lips moving as if she wanted to say something, but then she closed them tightly. It had been a long time since she spent time outside, so it was understandable that she felt reluctant. However, since we had completed our first 'communion' through the artifact, there was no reason to spend more time wandering the city together. Both of us were busy, so it was practical to go our separate ways quickly.

"Will you be able to make time like this again?"

"If the queen asks, I'll even quit school and come running."

"There's no need to go that far... but it feels nice to hear."

Did she think I was just flattering her? I was sincere.

"Yes. It's a shame, but we have to part ways today. The knights looking for me are already all over the city..."

Even though it was just one night, the queen's disappearance would be a major incident for the knights. Running away without a word, she seemed like a troublemaker despite her appearance.

"Then, I'll be going now!"

The queen, trying to shake off her reluctance, ran towards the knights without looking back. She still hadn't taken off her veil, but her steps seemed lighter, which was a relief. I was still the only one who had seen Hwaseorin's bare face. This might be quite a unique experience.

"...Shall I go?"

Shwaa-! The rain continued to pour steadily. The Stella uniform had a basic waterproof effect, but I still needed an umbrella to avoid getting soaked and risking hair loss. Hmm. Is it different in the Aether World? This world also had a rainy season, and thanks to that, my journey was accompanied by the sound of rain.

"Where are you headed?"

"To the Hwal Plain, to the Byeolgureum Merchant Guild."

After buying a ticket and boarding the train, I stared blankly out the window. The raindrops blurred the scenery. However, despite that, this world was still beautiful. It was too precious to be destroyed.

"Student, would you like your fortune told?"

A fortune teller wandering through the train cars approached me. I showed her the Stella mark and replied.

"I don't believe in that."

"Ah, you foolish spellcaster. Magic and astrology are clearly different."

Astrology was indeed a subject at Stella, but it was almost like a folk belief. It wasn't magically proven, nor did it show clear effects like lunar studies.

"If you do it for free, I'll listen."

So I cast a bait. Most would get annoyed and leave at this point, but those who were determined to make money would try to entice me with a fortune reading.

"Alright, what kind of fortune would you like?"

It seemed this fortune teller belonged to the latter group.

"Um... love fortune?"

When I mentioned the most common curiosity for people of all ages, the fortune teller grinned, showing her crooked teeth.

"You have a face that should never take love lightly. I guarantee it."

...What?

"Usually, wouldn't you try to sweet-talk me at this point? And you didn't even ask for my name or birthday?"

"Asking such things is what lowly people do. Just by looking at the sky, I can read the celestial energy, and by meeting your gaze, I can see through your nature. What need is there for names and birthdays?"

"Ah, I see."

I wasn't one to believe in fortune tellers, so I just nodded along.

"So, what does it mean that I shouldn't take love lightly? Usually, you'd say something like I'll fall in love within a few years or that I should meet a certain type of person, right?"

"Exactly as it sounds. You shouldn't meet people easily. A disaster on a continental scale will occur."

"...Sure. If you say so."

What kind of disaster would occur just from falling in love once? I was so dumbfounded that I didn't want to listen anymore.

"So, is there anything else you're curious about?"

"I have no money."

"Tsk, money isn't the important thing. Alright. I've had enough fun. We'll meet again next time."

"Excuse me?"

I was about to ask what she meant, but the fortune teller who had been standing in front of me just moments ago had vanished without a trace. Only an empty space remained.

"What, what is this?"

I hurriedly ran out into the train corridor and looked around, but there was no sign of anyone passing by. Her movements were ghostly enough to deceive even my magical senses.

"Seriously... what was that..."

The thought that some mysterious entity had just passed by sent chills down my spine.

The expedition led by Jelliel was determined to discover the 'Ancient Ruins of Karmenset' and successfully conquer it. With the help of her father's connections, they had a 7th-class mage with them, and veteran adventurers who were experts in dungeon exploration paved the way. The traps set by ancient magic were difficult to detect with modern magic, and the lingering spirits constantly gnawed at the expedition's mental strength. However, they pressed on without delay.

This was the power of capital. The result of gathering the world's best adventurers.

Boom!! _Entrance... granted...

After defeating the guardian that protected the final gate of the Ancient Karmenset, the 7th-class mage Kaderpilt approached Jelliel and spoke.

"Miss, only the final gate remains."

"...Thank you for your hard work."

The journey had been far from easy, and Jelliel's appearance was a mess. Her high-quality robe and adventurer suit were long torn and dirtied, but her face shone with light.

'Finally, finally, finally...!'

Her heart raced. As Jelliel walked forward, the mages and adventurers parted to make way for her.

The final gate. A soul chess match with the Ancient Karmenset. Only one person could face that great being in a chess match.

'I have practiced for this day.'

With her genius intellect, she had neglected even magic to study and research soul chess. To reach the highest level of skill in the world.

A chilling mist rose, and two red spots appeared in the air. The adventurers instinctively realized that these were 'eyes' of some kind. They all drew their staffs and aimed, but Jelliel raised her hand to stop them.

-...A pitiful and unfortunate soul has come to find me. What is the reason you have awakened me?

A deep, heavy voice echoed. Just hearing it made their knees tremble, but Jelliel managed to stay upright.

"Immortality. I want to live forever."

- I see, of course.

She wanted immortality. To live forever? No. To save her father, who had little time left... She had to obtain immortality at all costs.

- I will grant your wish. But only if you win against me in soul chess... Heh heh.

Boom!!!

Suddenly, the terrain collapsed, rose, crumbled, and reformed repeatedly, causing the adventurers to panic and shout at Jelliel.

"Miss!"

"Stay calm!"

She stood her ground without fear, not moving a single step. After a moment, the place where Jelliel stood had transformed into a large chessboard. Behind her were numerous chess pieces, but one crucial piece was missing.

'The King.'

Karmenset chuckled with a sinister laugh.

- You will move as the King yourself. If you lose... your soul will be mine.

There are many legends and tales about Karmenset. He tempts people by promising to grant any wish if they win a soul chess match, only to take their souls. The countless spirits that had tormented Jelliel's expedition throughout their exploration were likely the souls of those who had lost to Karmenset in chess.

'He promises to grant any wish... but no one has ever succeeded in making a wish...'

A legend filled with notorious infamy.

- Heh heh. So, will you play soul chess with me?

Was there any need to hesitate? She had lived her entire life for this moment.

"Of course."

Jelliel nodded without hesitation, and Karmenset shouted in an excited voice.

- Good! The thought of claiming your noble soul excites me! Let us begin the soul chess match!

Boom-!

Karmenset's chess pieces moved into position on their own. Jelliel stepped back, took her place as the King, closed her eyes, and raised her hand. As she directed, the chess pieces began to move into position.

'I won't lose.'

Soul chess begins the moment you place a piece on the board. Jelliel arranged a very special formation. One she had never used before, but had learned from her defeat to Baek Yuseol. The loss had been painful, but it had allowed her to grow even more.

- Now, let's begin! I'm curious to see your skills, young lady!

Creak-!

As Karmenset's chess pieces moved, the true soul chess match, with their souls on the line, began.
