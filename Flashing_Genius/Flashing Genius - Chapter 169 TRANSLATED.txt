# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 169

## 39. Ghost Story (5)

When the students of Stella usually gather, they meet at places like cafes or terraces for tea parties. It’s the epitome of a noble gathering, but... is it really necessary for commoners to do the same? So, Flame went to a chicken restaurant.

“...Chicken?”

“Seasoned chicken.”

“No, I mean, chicken...”

“I said seasoned chicken. Are you not eating?”

“I will eat, but...”

“Yeah. You like this kind of stuff.”

Angel hesitated and then stabbed the chicken with a fork. Annella, who was sitting next to Flame, was already gnawing on a drumstick.

“You shameless girl. There are only two drumsticks for three people, and you just took one?”

“Mm! Mmm!”

...It seemed she had taken it in a less than peaceful manner, but Flame snatched it back.

“Yeah. You eat. I’ll allow it.”

“Yes... I wondered why I needed permission to eat this, but it felt awkward to just eat it.”

“Eat a lot. This big sister is treating!”

Angel liked instant food. Pizza, chicken, hamburgers. Of course, it wasn’t cheap for commoners, so she couldn’t eat it often. There was a setting where Jeremy and Haewonryang fell for her when they saw her eyeing a cheap piece of chicken instead of a luxurious meal at a grand noble banquet.

‘In that sense, she’s similar to me.’

Flame also preferred instant food over noble cuisine. Caviar, foie gras, truffles? He had never tried them, but he didn’t think he would like them even if he did. Steak or whatever, quickly grilled pork belly wrapped in lettuce with ssamjang was the best.

The three girls silently ate chicken and drank cola, not beer, while chatting.

“So, why did you suddenly come?”

“Oh, that...”

“Why? Are you curious about that man’s whereabouts?”

“No! Not at all! That’s ridiculous.”

When Angel got angry, Flame laughed heartily. She casually mentioned information about Baek Yuseol while sipping her drink.

“He’s staying in some city in the west. He has some business there. I don’t know much, but since it’s him, it must be important.”

“I see...”

Suddenly, Angel felt doubtful about her daily life. Was there any meaning in her current life, where she was just studying like crazy? While someone was building a tower to save the world, was it right for her to be so focused on studying?

‘No. I am right.’

The reason Baek Yuseol didn’t study was that he had accumulated countless knowledge through thousands of regressions. To get closer to him, she had to study even harder.

“Ah, I don’t know. Where could he have gone in this situation?”

The atmosphere at the school was unusual. It seemed that the ghost stories circulating within the school were related to this incident, but she had no idea how to solve it.

But. In fact, Angel might know how to enter the 7th Main Tower. The reason she wasn’t sure was that she had heard this story from her father a long time ago. Her father had told her a ghost story in a playful tone, as if to scare a child.

She wondered if she should tell Flame this story.

‘Hmm...’

Flame waited silently for Angel. In the original novel, Angel didn’t consider the information she had about the ghost story of the 7th Main Tower to be important. So, she casually mentioned it to Haewonryang, who, being curious, delved deeply into it, which later helped solve the ‘Black Magic Erosion’ incident.

But reality was different. Angel and Haewonryang had almost no interaction, and currently, only two people knew about the ghost story. However, Flame couldn’t use the knowledge Angel had freely. That knowledge... could only be known if it was from Angel’s father.

So, he waited silently. For Angel to make up her mind and speak first.

“Nom.”

While Annella was eating chicken without a care, Flame and Angel put down their forks and spent time lost in their thoughts. Finally, Angel made up her mind and spoke first.

“...Actually, there’s a secret about the 7th Main Tower.”

“A secret?”

“Yes. There are rumors that the 7th Main Tower never existed, and some old photos show it was there but disappeared.”

“That’s right.”

There was still much debate about whether the 7th Main Tower actually existed.

“It did exist. Until 50 years ago.”

Angel began to speak slowly.

“Abelain Staberk. You know who he is, right?”

“...I know.”

Anyone who had read the original novel ‘Princess’ would have heard his name at least once. In this world, there were people who left achievements and fame that could be called ‘protagonists’ of their times. 200 years ago, it was ‘Eltman Eltwin,’ and half a century ago, it was ‘Abelain Staberk.’

Abelain Staberk, who achieved incredible feats that were hard to believe were done by one person. His life story alone could fill dozens of fantasy novels, but unfortunately, the original novel only briefly summarized his story without properly featuring him.

However... his end was not fitting for a protagonist. He committed the worst crime in the magical world, becoming a black magician. He killed three members of the Elder Council, crippled the former Full Moon Tower Lord, and fled. It was known that he was still alive, ruling over the black magicians.

Many believed that Abelain was hiding quietly after betraying the magical world, but Angel knew his current whereabouts accurately.

‘The Black Magic King.’

The black magician, known to be the strongest in this world, was Abelain Staberk. Why he betrayed the magical world didn’t matter. The important information now was that Abelain had hidden something in the 7th Main Tower, which was isolated in an invisible world.

“What’s hidden in the 7th Main Tower is not treasure or a legendary artifact. Abelain said he hid the ‘truth’ there.”

“The truth...”

“Yes. No one knows what the truth is, though.”

Maybe it was related to why Abelain betrayed the magical world. Annella spoke nonchalantly.

“But that truth, isn’t it something trivial? Even Principal Eltman isn’t looking for it.”

“Well... I don’t know about that. But maybe, we can find it. If so... would you be willing to go there?”

This was a cautious matter. It was like forcing Flame to take risks and make sacrifices. But Flame’s reaction was unexpected. Without a moment’s hesitation, he nodded.

“Of course, I’ll go. Is that why you dragged this out?”

“I see...”

Hearing that a great magician like Flame would accompany her, Angel felt relieved. Then, she decided to tell the ghost story she knew.

At that moment.

“Hey, there’s a commotion at the 4th Main Tower. Come quickly, something’s happening.”

“What? What’s going on?”

Suddenly, the surroundings became noisy. If it was loud enough to reach the restaurant, it meant something serious was happening. As soon as Flame heard the students’ words, he jumped up and ran. Angel followed her, and Annella, not knowing what was going on, followed them.

The 4th Main Tower was nearby, and they ran towards the source of the commotion. When they reached the D-17 corridor on the 30th floor, the staff was already controlling the area.

“Quiet! All students, step back!”

“Return to your dormitories! If you don’t listen, you’ll get demerits!”

The crowd of students and the staff trying to control them were mixed, making it hard to see anything. The corridor windows were all shattered, and the floor was soaked with water. But something stood out.

On the wet corridor floor... bright red letters were floating.

The professors were trying to erase it with magic, but it didn’t seem to work, and they were sweating profusely.

‘Of course, it won’t work.’

Flame understood why the professors couldn’t erase it with magic. The letters were written in the ‘hidden world,’ not reality. Ordinary magic that could only interfere with reality couldn’t erase even a simple phrase.

“Stop.”

Suddenly, a young boy’s voice was heard, and all the commotion stopped. The students were speechless, and the professors stepped back stiffly. The crowd parted like a miracle, and a boy walked through.

Eltman Eltwin.

He always showed a relaxed and smiling face, but now he had a stern expression. He walked silently on the water-covered floor and clicked his tongue when he saw the floating letters. Then he took out a scroll and sealed the letters inside it.

People reacted with admiration, saying, ‘As expected of the principal,’ but Flame saw it differently. Why did he take out a scroll instead of using his own magic? It was obvious. His spatial magic couldn’t touch it. So he had to use a scroll containing another magician’s magic.

Eltman looked around with a grim expression and asked a professor in a low voice.

“Is anyone hurt?”

“There are no injuries, but...”

The professor answered gloomily and pointed to the back. There, three girls were hugging each other, trembling. Their appearance was familiar. They exuded an air of nobility, each wearing a brooch adorned with red rubies, proudly showing their affiliation.

‘Huh?’

Just as Flame thought something was wrong, the professor said something unbelievable.

“First-year Class S, Hong Biyeon has... disappeared into an unknown space.”

That was... a major incident that Flame had never expected or imagined.
