## Chapter 240: The Witch's Restaurant

The Witch's Restaurant. Uniquely, this restaurant opens in the evening and closes in the morning. It travels all over Arcanium, making its exact location difficult to pinpoint. Currently, all the students from the five prestigious magic schools in Arcanium are searching for this restaurant with fervor. The owner, 'Melisher,' greeted the boys and girls who visited today with a smile full of laughter.

The menu is truly diverse. Since the students are elite from all over the world, they often order food from other regions, longing for the taste of their hometown. Melisher knew how to cook all those dishes. To be precise, she only knew how to cook them, but the taste was actually terrible. Nevertheless, the customers praised the food as delicious and kept coming back. The reason? Simple. These dishes were not ordinary but magical cuisine.

Magical cuisine? It sounds like a strange term. No one would have heard of cooking with magic. But Melisher could do it. She was a witch and knew how to handle very special magic, different from ordinary wizards.

'This is enough.' Melisher smiled faintly as she watched the students eating busily in her restaurant. Witches had to hide, suffering all kinds of persecution. No matter how superior a witch was against a wizard, they were very few in number, and as long as witch hunters existed, revealing themselves was impossible. Thus, witches had no choice but to suppress or seal their magic and live like ordinary people.

Melisher hated this life bound by shackles and decided to reveal herself to the world. It was dangerous to do so in an ordinary way. She had to act very quietly and secretly, but she had to make a definite impact on the magic world so that the existence of witches would be feared.

'This method was right.' The Witch's Restaurant was just a rumor among students, so the Magic Department wouldn't directly interfere. However, teenagers who follow trends wouldn't be able to resist the Witch's Restaurant. They would search high and low for it, and some chosen ones would finally reach this place.

'Fools who think they are successful predators, not knowing they are caught in a trap.' They would think they were successful predators, but in reality, they were just caught in Melisher's trap. The young wizards, intoxicated by the magic in the food, would increasingly seek her food and eventually become slaves who couldn't live without the Witch's Restaurant. The scariest part was that their 'witch addiction' wouldn't show on the surface. They would continue their daily lives as usual and become excellent wizards, taking positions in the best magic institutions worldwide. When that time comes...

The seeds Melisher planted would bloom, and a part of the magic world would fall into her hands.

'I don't dream of something absurd like world domination.' Many witches who aimed for world domination met terrible deaths. Melisher didn't have such grand dreams.

'At least, if I can control and shake even a small part of the magic world with my hands...' Perhaps she could bring the witches hiding in the shadows of the world back into the light. She had endured this humiliation for a long time. It was pitiful and infuriating to lure teenage fledglings with a shabby restaurant, but if she waited a little longer, her efforts would surely bear fruit.

Ding-!

As the students were about to finish their meals and prepare to leave, the restaurant door opened, and Melisher showed a puzzled expression.

'What is it?' She had cast a vision-blocking spell to ensure no other customers could enter after receiving the current ones. It should have been impossible for anyone else to approach.

'Did I make a mistake?' It didn't matter. Since she was disguised as a restaurant, Melisher greeted the customer with a business smile.

"Welcome..."

- Witch. Found you.

Thunk!

She would have bowed her head in greeting if it weren't for the cold sensation piercing her chest.

"Ugh..."

Melisher raised her trembling hand. Red blood flowed like a waterfall over her palm.

"Damn it..."

As she coughed up blood and collapsed to the floor, the students who witnessed the scene began to scream.

"Ahhh!!"

"W-what is this!"

"M-murder!"

However, the witch hunter who stabbed Melisher's chest with a transparent blade floated in the air, his torn robe fluttering without a single movement.

- A witch who even abandoned her pride. Hiding your heart...

The witch hunter spoke in a voice like nails on a chalkboard, and Melisher smiled, wiping the blood.

"Of course. You always aim for our hearts, so why would I leave it in an obvious place?"

As Melisher clenched her palm, gathering her magic, the transparent blade piercing her chest shattered into pieces, and the space began to fold rapidly.

"Ahhh!"

"Save me!"

"Ahhh!!"

Melisher frowned at the students' screams. They had boasted about becoming the next magic warriors, but now they were busy screaming at the sight of magic. She wanted to cut off their heads immediately, but she had no time for that, so she grabbed the air and shook it.

Whoosh!

The small Witch's Restaurant spun wildly, spitting out all the students and slamming the door shut. However, the witch hunter, as if unaffected by the illusion magic manipulating space, remained unmoved.

- How clumsy. Even if you shake the space, I can just hold onto it.

Flutter!

As the witch hunter shook his robe, black shadows flowed out and began to permeate the entire Witch's Restaurant.

- An illusion is just an illusion. It cannot resist the truth I handle.

As he said, all the illusions Melisher created were devoured by reality. Even in such a situation, she leisurely wiped the blood from her mouth and slowly stood up, holding a broom-shaped staff.

"Ridiculous."

- ...Hmm?

At that moment, the black shadow magic that was devouring the Witch's Restaurant stopped moving. As if there were no more illusions to devour.

- This is...

"Did you think we would always use primitive magic like putting frogs in a cauldron and stirring?"

As Melisher swung her staff, the shadows turned into rainbow-colored thorns in the illusion and rushed towards the witch hunter.

Thunk, thunk!

The witch hunter's body had no substance, but Melisher tore it apart anyway.

- You, are you...

"Don't bother me. I'm busy with the restaurant business."

- Unbelievable...

A witch hunts wizards. A witch hunter hunts witches. This relationship is an absolute food chain that has never been broken in the history of the magic world. Therefore, it was normal for a witch hunter to unilaterally chase and be chased by a witch upon discovery.

- Impossible...

Even as his body was torn apart by the illusion barrier, the witch hunter glared at Melisher with red eyes. Despite the terrifying gaze that could appear in nightmares, Melisher calmly wiped the blood from her chest.

"A heart..."

The witch hunter aimed for her heart, but that was his fatal mistake.

"You should have checked properly."

Melisher muttered and sighed as she sensed numerous presences approaching from outside. It seemed the space interference barrier was completely disrupted, and the wizards noticed and were approaching.

"Tch, today's business is a bust."

Melisher flicked her finger.

Swish!

The barrier protecting the Witch's Restaurant closed, and it disappeared from the space in an instant, leaving nothing behind.

"...Too late."

The Stella Knights, who arrived at the scene belatedly, frowned. They had come as soon as they sensed the magic, but the restaurant had disappeared so quickly.

"It's okay."

As the Stella Knights stared blankly at the spot where the Witch's Restaurant had vanished, Baek Yuseol walked over leisurely from behind.

"What do you mean, it's okay?"

They had temporarily included Baek Yuseol in the knights on the orders of Captain Arein, but honestly, they couldn't trust the young and arrogant boy. They had also been called 'geniuses' in their youth and had achieved great feats before proudly becoming members of the great Stella Knights. So, how could they view him favorably when he was given even temporary knight status without any merit?

Baek Yuseol understood their feelings well, but he found it tiresome to respond to each one, having experienced a similar precedent ten years ago.

"It seems there was a battle."

"Yes, we know that much."

"Do you know who and how the battle was fought?"

It was a very natural question, but they couldn't answer.

"We'll find out gradually. I'll bring the 'Compass of Memory.' There are strong traces of mana left here."

"It's useless. Events that occurred in an illusionary space don't leave memories."

"Are you saying it won't work without even trying? You may be young, but the Compass of Memory..."

"It's a witch hunter."

"...What?"

"The traces of that mana. It's the corpse of a witch hunter."

At his sudden words, the knights were stunned.

"That's ridiculous..."

It was a normal reaction. Witch hunters were very few in number, and their existence was shrouded in mystery. Who would believe it if someone said the scattered pieces of cloth and the mana conglomerate in the air were the remains of a witch hunter?

But they were the Stella Knights. They had to be able to think broadly and deeply to solve cases that no one else could.

'Honestly, I was a bit surprised too.'

He could analyze the traces of the witch hunter through his binoculars, but since this didn't happen in the original game, he was genuinely surprised. According to the original, that witch hunter was supposed to attack Angel, not a witch.

'I don't know what happened, but it's better this way.'

The witch hunter's corpse would be a significant clue.

"Let's investigate that first."

"...Crazy. A witch hunter's corpse? You're delusional."

"Excuse me? No, it's true."

"Stop talking nonsense and step back."

"I trusted Captain Arein's words, but I'm a bit disappointed."

"If you can't help, at least don't get in the way."

As the knights pushed him back, Baek Yuseol looked bewildered.

'Is this the Stella Knights? Really?'

In the original game, the 'Stella Knights' were described as the world's top group of the strongest individuals. It wasn't wrong. They were indeed the most powerful in terms of force. But that didn't mean every member was an elite. They were still sprouts that hadn't fully grown. They hadn't yet achieved enlightenment and were stuck in their pride as 'knights,' unable to make flexible judgments. They might be considered strong wizards outside, but they were still not fully qualified as members of the Stella Knights.

Their knowledge was undoubtedly broad and deep, but their thinking was stuck at that level.

'I understand why Arein sent these fools to me...'

Arein must have thought they were suitable for the Stella Knights and appointed them as knights, but they showed no proper growth due to their rigid personalities. Arein must have wanted to give them a strong stimulus to make them realize their mistakes.

'...I asked for a helpful errand boy, but he sent me a burden.'

But Arein's judgment was quite good. Because Baek Yuseol planned to find the witch while they were doing nothing.

'It's better this way. With the witch hunter dead, Angel won't be in danger.'

One of the reasons he wanted to solve this case quickly was gone, so it was a relief. He stood up and looked in the direction of Stella Academy. He didn't know what variables his actions would create in the future by blocking and erasing all the stories before the episode even started, but he was willing to do anything for the safety of the protagonists attending that school.
