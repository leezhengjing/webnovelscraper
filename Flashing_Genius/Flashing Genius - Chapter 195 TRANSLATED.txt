# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 195: Everything Frozen (8)

The energy that emits light and heat. It was the most crucial element, the very source of everything in this world, yet it couldn't be properly controlled even with magic. It could only be used to create explosions, attack enemies, illuminate surroundings, or forcibly extract something else as a power source. But now, that was no longer the case.

‘This is the true flame...’

Hong Biyeon felt she could grasp the true definition of the flame that no one in history had ever understood. The flame danced along the path her palm moved, and when she quietly brought her index finger close, a butterfly of flame landed on it. Something no one had ever done before. Therefore, it was an even greater feat.

‘I can do it.’

I am the flame, and the flame is me. Immersing myself in the source of the world and becoming one with the fire, moving it as if it were my hands and feet, felt neither awkward nor strange. Rather, it was a joyful and fantastic experience. Who else could have such a mystical experience? Only I can do this. Just a little more... If I accept this mysterious sensation, I feel I can perfectly understand the true definition of the ‘flame.’

...That was the plan.

- No! Stop it! Ugh!

At the sharp voice ringing in her head, Hong Biyeon snapped out of her thoughts and opened her eyes. The sensation of the flame clinging to her body evaporated into thin air.

‘...What are you doing?’

- You are in danger if you go any further.

The voice, the incarnation of fire, spoke in a calm tone for the first time.

- You are too young and weak to grasp that enlightenment. If you understand the ‘truth’ at your current level... you will become one with the fire and be annihilated.

‘What... what are you talking about? You told me to go berserk before.’

- That was because I wanted you to be annihilated. I deeply despise Adolevit to my core. Haha, though I have no bones!

Hong Biyeon closed her eyes tightly. She wanted to grasp that truth again, but it had already fled far away and showed no signs of returning. It was unbearably painful and distressing, but there was no way now.

- Just hold on a little longer. It won't be long. You can grasp it again. I guarantee it. Even Adolevit, the disciple of the first mage, couldn't do it... but you can.

‘...Why?’

- I am a fragment of the Red Moon and the incarnation of fire. Therefore, I can guarantee it. You will... find me again someday.

At those words, Hong Biyeon was momentarily stunned.

- You are too precious to disappear here. Ha... damn it. I never thought the day would come when I would save a human.

After grumbling a few times, he spoke to Hong Biyeon in a calm voice.

- Adolevit's kid, listen well. The flame dormant in your body will soon burn you painfully. You can't withstand it as you are now. So, you must expel it all immediately. Can you do it?

‘That’s...’

- Perfect timing. There's a big piece of firewood right in front of you. Let's burn it!

Hong Biyeon slowly turned her gaze to look at the Pirate King, Black Belize. Behind his towering figure, a massive ice spike was growing. Although she had no knowledge of it, she instinctively knew. The moment that spike touched the sky... this entire area would be covered in ice. It must be stopped before that happens.

‘...Can I do it?’

Hong Biyeon slowly ignited a flame. Although the sensation of becoming one with the fire had mostly disappeared, thanks to the help of the fire incarnation, an explosive energy she had never felt before was moving through her meridians.

- The best thing would be to burn that guy's eyes with the flame and then run away. You can't defeat him with your current strength.

- Damn, it's frustrating. If you were just a bit stronger, I could share more of my flame with you...

‘It doesn't matter.’

Whoosh! Hong Biyeon, with flames in both hands, soared high into the sky. Although she had never learned flight magic, she understood the principle. Using the wings of flame spread by the fire incarnation, flying freely was a piece of cake.

The Pirate King slowly followed Hong Biyeon with his gaze and then spoke in a low voice.

- Do not resist.

“...My life has always been about resistance.”

Having lived a life of resistance, how could she stop now just because she was told not to? Hong Biyeon’s eyes gleamed sharply as she threw the flame with all her might.

...Immediately after.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

An enormous explosion, unbelievable that she had caused it, shook the Pirate King's skull greatly.

“This, this is...”

- Haha! How is it? Amazing, right? That's just a fraction of my power!

Gulp, she swallowed hard. This level of power could be considered above the 8th class. But to think this is just a fraction of the power, it was hard to believe.

- But handle it carefully. The flame I can provide you is limited. If your body can't withstand it, I'll extinguish the flame immediately. I... don't want you to die.

Without answering, Hong Biyeon flew even higher. Then, she gathered the flames in her hands and compressed them. Initially, it was about the size of a large hut, but it gradually shrank to the size of a carriage, and finally, it became as small as a full-length mirror, emitting a bright light like a small sun.

‘Using small magic multiple times is useless.’

Inside the Pirate King, just like her, the incarnation of ice was dormant. However, he could fully control the incarnation's power, whereas she could not. Therefore, her plan was to deliver a maximum effective blow to incapacitate him temporarily and then destroy the spike behind him.

Even while Hong Biyeon was using magic, the Pirate King just watched her quietly.

- You resemble that woman...

Then, muttering such incomprehensible words, he raised his palm to create an ice barrier.

“Too late!”

Hong Biyeon threw the small sun with all her might at the ice barrier, and immediately, steam exploded, sending a tremendous shockwave in all directions.

Bang-!!

- Hmm...!

For the first time, the Pirate King, Black Belize, who had never been shaken by any attack, took a step back. Watching that scene... people finally found hope.

“The princess is fighting the Pirate King...”

“This is unbelievable...”

Hong Biyeon did not have a significant position within the royal family. Although it was known that she was a genius, it was far from enough compared to the countless achievements of Hong Siwha, so it did not become a significant merit. Her cold and aloof personality made it difficult for people to approach her. Additionally, she had grown up being hated by the queen, so even if someone liked her, it was not easy to be friendly with her.

The third princess was firmly hated by the queen. Was there anyone in the palace who did not know that fact? Therefore, following the queen's orders and the atmosphere of the palace, they hated and despised Hong Biyeon. It became a natural thing, and no one questioned it.

However, upon reflection, despite all that, Hong Biyeon lived on. Without giving up, she displayed and unleashed her talents to the fullest, and finally, she stood there... fighting against the Pirate King's vengeful spirit, which even the queen could not face.

Boom-!!

The power of each spell cast by Hong Biyeon and the Pirate King was at least 8th class, so the shockwaves generated whenever they clashed were beyond what an ordinary mage could withstand. It might seem evenly matched, but unfortunately, Hong Biyeon soon reached her limit.

- Hey, be more careful. The flame allowed to you is not that much.

‘...I know.’

There was no choice. This flame was not hers. It was borrowed from the fire incarnation, so she had to use it sparingly and carefully. However, to find a gap in the Pirate King, who had a much greater power than her, there was no other way.

‘There’s no time... Even if the Pirate King falls here, the moment that spike touches the sky, it will be irreversible.’

She closed her eyes tightly. She pondered and pondered again. But no matter how much she thought about it.

‘There’s only one way...’

Flying in the sky, avoiding the Pirate King's attacks as much as possible while emitting flames, Hong Biyeon suddenly changed direction. Towards the Pirate King.

- Huh? Hey, you crazy kid! What are you doing? Keep your distance! You can't handle him in close combat!

The fire incarnation urgently tried to stop her, but Hong Biyeon did not stop her charge. Drawing a trajectory of flames, she flew through the air, reaching the Pirate King's vicinity, where an enormous cold wave and ice storm swept over her.

“Ugh...!”

She struggled to emit flames to withstand the terrifying cold, but it was impossible to completely erase the pain. However, she endured it resolutely and advanced towards the Pirate King.

- You, could it be...

Finally realizing something, the fire incarnation spoke in a bewildered voice.

- Are you planning to explode all the remaining flames at once...?

Hong Biyeon did not answer. There was no need to praise him for guessing correctly.

- No, but... Then you can definitely destroy the ‘Root of Winter’...

Some spells are more effective when cast from a distance, while others are more effective when cast up close. However, the flame Hong Biyeon was emitting was not exactly a spell. It was merely following her knowledge and theory, taking form and being emitted. However, having glimpsed a bit of the ‘truth’ about flames, she knew well. The act of forcibly shaping the flame was merely a framework created by mages who could not properly control the flame.

To show the true power of the flame, there must be no control. So she decided not to control it. She would emit all the flames dormant within her at once. Then... for a moment, it would be possible to mimic the grand magic of a great 9th class mage.

But. All good, but.

- ...What do you plan to do next?

The fire incarnation asked, but Hong Biyeon did not answer.

- Surely, you are not foolishly planning to sacrifice yourself for the country, are you? If so, stop immediately. You are more valuable than all the people of this country combined!

‘...Don’t talk nonsense.’

Finally reaching the Pirate King's nose, Hong Biyeon looked him straight in the eye. The sharp blizzard and whirlpool pressing down on her were fierce, but she was not afraid. She slowly, but not carefully, drew out all the flames dormant within her. Including the faint flames she possessed.

Whoosh!

A small candle flame bloomed in the midst of the great blizzard. It might seem insignificant at first glance, but the fact that a flame bloomed in such a massive storm was already proof that it was not ordinary. The candle flame gradually grew in size. Like an avalanche. Initially, it was the size of a pebble, but after a little time, it grew to the size of a house, and before she knew it, it had become a massive sun that filled her entire field of vision.

‘Hellfire.’

The ultimate flame spell that burns and burns the enemy until they are annihilated.

- This is...!

Since it was not a spell, it was emitted without any casting or preparation time, catching even the Pirate King off guard.

- What a reckless act! To think you would charge in with your frail human body and emit flames...

The Pirate King, greatly flustered, tried to cover Hong Biyeon with ice. However, the ice could not reach her and melted away.

Boom!!

The ribs protecting the Pirate King's heart melted in the fire, his jaw caught fire and burned fiercely, and his lower body wobbled, making it impossible to maintain balance. Even so... the Pirate King did not fall. This level of explosion was not enough. He had stolen the divine artifact of the Bronze Twelve Moons, fully accepted the incarnation of ice into his body, and after a thousand years, he could now exert power equal to or greater than a 9th class mage.

The Pirate King, emitting a fierce light from his eyes, spoke to Hong Biyeon.

- Foolish act. Even in that, you are just like that woman.

Although he suffered significant damage, the Pirate King did not fall. In contrast, the weak human mage would burn to death from the flames she had unleashed. Even if not, the Pirate King would not let her go, having already caught her in his grasp.

However, Hong Biyeon's goal was never the Pirate King. The source of the disaster. The blue root of winter that sought to cover the entire world in eternal winter. Hong Biyeon closed her eyes. She controlled the flame one last time to direct its path.

...In an instant, an explosion. And then silence. No more noise could be heard.

- What have you done...!

The Pirate King, Black Belize's bewildered voice echoed through the heavens. The Hellfire spear she had created successfully pierced through his massive body, completely severing the root of winter growing behind him.

- ...But now, it’s over.

The low voice of the fire incarnation brushed past Hong Biyeon's ear. By severing the root of winter, the disaster could be prevented. There would no longer be an eternal winter in the world. However... the Pirate King was still alive. And he was genuinely enraged at Hong Biyeon.

The fire incarnation felt immense pain at the fact that he could do nothing in this desperate situation. For the first time in his life, he had met a human he wanted to save. She could surpass Adolevit and truly understand the existence of ‘fire.’

- There’s nothing I can do...

The Pirate King's roar echoed throughout the world. The shockwave transformed the clouds into a donut shape, and the flying ships hanging in the air were all pushed back. Hong Biyeon, kneeling in the midst of the catastrophe, looked up at it. The sky was blue. The constellations were particularly beautiful that night.

- You have exhausted all your flames and can no longer resist him. It’s unfortunate. If I had met you when you had grown a little more...

The Pirate King, enraged, raised his hands. What was he planning to do? She didn't know, but even if she did, she wouldn't be able to respond.

- I will commend your spirit of self-sacrifice for the country. It was a brief but enjoyable time, descendant of Adolevit.

The fire incarnation gave a bitter farewell, but Hong Biyeon found his misunderstanding amusing and let out a hollow laugh, shaking her head.

“What are you talking about? I don't want to die yet.”

- What?

She had a clear goal. A reason to live. Because she had to be happy in the future. Self-sacrifice? She would never do such a foolish thing. Hong Biyeon was just an extremely selfish girl who traveled her whole life in search of her happiness.

- Then, why...

Why did she do such a reckless thing if she didn't want to die? The fire incarnation was about to ask in astonishment when suddenly... an aurora spread across the sky. The clouds parted right above where the Pirate King, Black Belize, stood, and a mysterious pillar of light poured down. And from there, a boy appeared. His clothes were tattered and torn, but it was unmistakably the uniform of Stella. Although he was so far away that he seemed like a dot, Hong Biyeon recognized him faster than anyone else.

‘...You finally came.’

He was desperately falling towards this place, holding a long blue spear in one hand. The mysterious spear left a trail of blue light as it moved, making his movement look like a slow-motion lightning strike, so beautiful that it momentarily mesmerized even in this urgent situation.

Yes... I knew you would come like this.

She had no intention of dying. No matter what reckless act she committed, she knew he would come if she succeeded. Flash! The blue light falling from the sky instantly pierced the Pirate King's heart, and suddenly, a flash of light burst, turning the whole world white. In that world, Hong Biyeon finally smiled.

‘I am... still alive.’

There was only one proof that she was alive. Because this moment was happy. Because the feeling of happiness overflowed like waves, making her heart burst. She was alive. And she would live tomorrow as well. Because tomorrow would be happier than today.
