# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 238

## 49. The Witch (5)

Late at night, Flame arrived at the library and was immediately greeted by the librarian.

"It's too late to borrow any books."

"It doesn't matter."

Since she had no intention of borrowing books in the first place, she nodded and looked around. The Stella Library was almost deserted late at night, and there was once a rumor among the students about a "night library ghost." It turned out that the "ghost" was actually third-year seniors who were studying all night to get into the university's magic tower, and the rumor quickly died down.

"No one is here..."

"Is there a specific book you're looking for?"

"No, I just..."

Flame closed her mouth. Thinking about it, coming all the way here to ask about Baek Yuseol's whereabouts seemed quite ridiculous.

'This is kind of embarrassing...'

Should she just go back? As she was contemplating, the librarian, who had been staring at her name tag, clapped her hands and said,

"Ah! You're Baek Yuseol's girlfriend, right?"

"What?"

Why didn't she naturally deny it?

"There was a book left behind earlier. It's the kind Baek Yuseol was looking for, so he might like it... Could you pass it on to him later?"

The librarian handed her the book, and Flame accepted it.

**[The Witch and the Truth]**

In other words, the information Baek Yuseol had been searching for in the library was about witches.

"...Sure. I'll pass it on."

Holding the book, Flame left the library and walked down the street, thinking.

'Witches do exist.'

Having read the original romance fantasy, she knew well. Witches were often mentioned and appeared frequently, even though they supposedly lived hidden from the world. And soon, there would be a major commotion in Arcanium because of a witch. Originally, Angel would have been caught up in it, but thanks to Baek Yuseol's preemptive actions, she was safe. However, the future where a witch causes trouble remains unchanged. Baek Yuseol seems to be planning to stop the witch...

'Do I need to look into witches?'

Reading books about witches in the library would be useless. There wasn't a single properly recorded book about witches. Baek Yuseol would know this better than anyone, yet he still sought out and read books, which means there must be a reason.

'He either lost some knowledge or has a question even he doesn't know the answer to.'

If it's the former, there's no need to worry, but if a mystery that even Baek Yuseol doesn't know arises, Flame might be able to help. In the original romance fantasy, Angel almost became a witch, so the setting about witches was detailed, making her practically an expert.

"Hmm..."

As Flame was about to return to her dormitory, she changed her steps towards the boys' dormitory. Although it was late, Baek Yuseol would also return to sleep, so she decided to wait for him at his dormitory.

Stella's Chief Knight, Arain.

If I were to define his personality from the original game in one word, it would be "psycho."

"You're here."

"Yes."

Arriving at Arain's office, I quietly observed my surroundings. From what I knew, he had a personality close to madness, but the bright and clean interior of his office felt quite awkward. It's hard to believe that someone with his personality would like decorating.

"Sit here."

Without even offering tea or coffee, Arain got straight to the point.

"I heard you're personally investigating witches recently."

"...Yes, that's right."

"Is there a special reason?"

What should I say? Just out of interest? No. Arain wouldn't want such a common answer. He never wasted his time on trivial matters, so it would be best to give him the answer he wanted.

"I want to hunt witches."

"That's a foolish thought."

...Should I not have said that?

Arain, maintaining a stern expression, rubbed his wrist and said,

"A wizard cannot hunt a witch. You know that well."

"Yes, I know."

Witches, who mainly use illusion magic, were an absolute counter to wizards who dealt with tangible things scientifically. No matter how hard you summon flames or roll ice, if your mind is tampered with, you become a helpless fool. And I know that Arain suffered a fatal injury fighting a witch 12 years ago. Having faced a witch himself, he knows better than anyone how foolish it is for a wizard to fight a witch.

"But... you might be a bit different."

Arain looked into my eyes.

"Magic Leakage Delay."

"You have a body structure different from other wizards. Your body is quite disadvantageous for using magic, but conversely, it means you're less likely to be affected by magic."

"That's correct."

In fact, I could completely dispel illusion magic.

"So, I have a proposal for you."

Arain placed a pocket watch on the table. Pocket watches were commonly used by wizards to prove their affiliation, but unlike the student pocket watch I had, Arain's was golden with embossed star patterns.

'Stella Knight's Pocket Watch'

He spoke calmly.

"It's a pocket watch that temporarily certifies you as a member of the Stella Knights."

"Does that mean..."

"You've been working alone so far, and despite that, you've accomplished a lot. But there's a limit to what you can do alone."

Pushing the pocket watch towards me, Arain continued,

"If you accept this and become a member of the Knights, I promise to treat you with the same respect as a formal knight and provide you with information that ordinary people cannot access."

"...Is this an invitation to join?"

"Yes. You have a unique presence within Stella. This level of condition is necessary."

The Stella Knights, known as the world's best armed organization and often called the 'world police,' were not easy to join. Not only did one need a high level of magic, but they also had to build a career by hunting dark wizards or subjugating magical beasts for years to prove their skills. So, it's even stranger. Although I've solved many incidents, compared to the achievements of each member of the Stella Knights, mine are insignificant.

"If you accept this pocket watch, you can use some of the Knights' authority even as a student and become a formal knight upon graduation. I guarantee it."

"That's... quite generous."

"Think of it that way if you want."

I stared at the pocket watch.

'This is really good.'

The reason I worked alone was that I had no one to move with. Even if I joined the Knights, I couldn't reveal future information, so I'd still be working alone, but the help from the Knights would be a significant advantage. Moreover, there was a practical issue. I always worried about what I would do after preventing the future destruction. As someone who couldn't use magic or alchemy, the Magic Knights, where rank is determined solely by combat ability, was the most suitable group for me.

"Of course, there's one condition."

"...A condition?"

"The Stella Knights, as an armed group without a nation, are currently acting as cheap problem solvers."

It didn't sound like he had any pride in being a Magic Knight.

"You will also act as a student normally, but when a mission comes, you must follow orders."

...That's a bit off-putting.

Seeing my displeased expression, Arain immediately revised the condition.

"But since you need to focus on your studies, frequent missions would be difficult. I'll assign you missions related to the incidents you're interested in, as it is now. Is that enough?"

"More than enough. Why are you treating me so well?"

"I hold you in high regard. For the future of the Stella Knights... you are essential."

"Come on, what have I done to deserve such praise?"

I joked to lighten the mood, thinking he was overestimating me, but he remained stern and unwavering.

"...Are you serious?"

"Yes."

If he says so, there's no need to hesitate. The conditions were good, and for some reason, Arain trusted me greatly, so I just needed to take advantage of it.

"I'll do it."

When I accepted the pocket watch, Arain's expression slightly relaxed, seemingly satisfied.

"Congratulations on becoming a temporary Stella Knight. Now, let's discuss your first mission."

"...You're giving me a mission right away without even an appointment letter?"

"It's a mission you'll find interesting. It's related to witches."

Every time he mentioned witches, he kept touching his wrist.

"That... yes, it's interesting."

When I agreed, Arain, as if expecting it, took out prepared documents and placed them on the table.

"Your mission is to track and, if possible, eliminate the witch causing trouble in Arcanium."

After saying that, he clasped his hands together.

"Can you do it?"

Without hesitation, I accepted the documents and nodded.

"Of course."

After that, I had a long conversation with Arain about witches before I could leave.

'As you already know, witches do exist.'

Starting with that, Arain tried to provide me with as much information as possible without mentioning his defeat by a witch. Unfortunately, most of it was information I already knew. However, there was one particularly interesting piece of information. It might be directly related to the reason I kept hearing hallucinations.

A witch with a grudge binds her soul to an object...

"Hmm?"

When I returned to the dormitory, I found the door slightly open. Did I not close it properly?

'Whatever.'

There's CCTV, so there's little chance of a thief. After entering the dormitory, I took a quick shower and securely hid the document envelope in a makeshift storage. Then, I turned off the lights and was about to collapse onto the bed when I felt a soft, warm object next to me, startling me into sitting up.

"What the...?"

Summoning my glasses to brighten my vision, I saw...

"...Flame?"

A small girl with short hair was curled up like a shrimp, sleeping soundly.

'Did I come to the wrong dormitory...?'

No, the room's structure was definitely my dormitory. What is she doing here?

Seeing her sleeping in the corner of the bed, I felt more bewildered than angry. Should I carry her back to her dormitory? Or should I sleep somewhere else?

"Sigh, whatever."

But thinking about it, it was all too troublesome. Since I planned to roam all over Arcanium starting tomorrow, I wanted to rest properly. So, I pushed Flame to the corner and collapsed onto the bed. It was quite bothersome and uncomfortable, but...

I should be able to sleep.
