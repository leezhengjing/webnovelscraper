# The Genius Who Became a Teleporter at the Magic School

## Chapter 234: The Witch (1)

Ding-dong-dang! As the bell signaling the end of the tedious class rings, announcing dinner time, students scatter towards their respective destinations. Some head to the dining hall to eat with friends, others might go out, and some might skip dinner altogether to attend night study sessions. 

Eizel usually enjoys meals with her friends. Despite her obsession with studying, she never skips a meal. Previously, she couldn't afford to eat, but now that she can, she believes in maintaining her health. Eizel meticulously manages her physical strength through regular exercise, adheres strictly to her schedule, and enjoys healthy food. She is thorough in self-management.

"Eizel! Do you want to eat out today?"

"…Huh?"

Eizel has two weaknesses, one of which is her friend Marillen, whom she became closest to at Stella Academy.

"Ta-da!" Marillen said, spreading a flyer with both hands. It looked somewhat crude to be officially made.

"It's the 'Witch's Restaurant.' You've heard of it, right? It's really famous around here these days."

"Uh… I think I've heard of it."

She had heard students talking about it in passing.

"The strange thing about the Witch's Restaurant is that you can't find it if you look for it normally."

"What do you mean?"

"Exactly what I said. Even if you search every corner of the magic city Arcanium, there's no place called the Witch's Restaurant."

"Then how do people eat there?"

"The weird thing is, if you wander around the student streets of Arcanium at dusk, the Witch's Restaurant suddenly appears. There are tons of stories from people who have actually eaten there."

"…That sounds like just a rumor."

"No, you know Chailey from Class C? She said she ate there too. So, do you want to go out and look for it tonight?"

"Hmm…"

Teenagers' interests often explode in strange areas, leading to peculiar trends. The Witch's Restaurant. Eizel wasn't particularly interested, but since she had nothing else to do in the evening, she nodded. Eating out was a luxury she never indulged in, but recently she had some financial leeway and found a way to reclaim part of her father's wealth, so it didn't matter much.

"Sure, I'll go."

"Great!"

"But what kind of menu do they have there?"

"From what I've heard, they sell a variety of dishes. They said there's nothing they don't have."

Usually, famous restaurants are known for a few similar dishes, but the Witch's Restaurant is unique in that it offers a wide variety of dishes, all of which are said to be delicious.

"Alright, let's go quickly!"

Thus, Eizel, along with Marillen and five other friends, ventured out. The streets were filled with teenagers, all holding flyers, seemingly searching for the Witch's Restaurant.

"There are so many people…"

The Witch's Restaurant was already a well-known rumor within Arcanium, and it seemed many students from the magic school had gone out to find it.

"It feels like a festival."

Every fall, when the five prestigious schools of Arcanium hold festivals, the city is filled with crowds, but it was rare to see so many people even when it wasn't festival time.

"But! If it's for delicious food, I can wait as long as it takes!"

…An hour passed. As the sun began to set, the girls, tired from wandering around, started to lose their enthusiasm. Eizel shook her head. While searching for the restaurant was fun, it was inevitable that they would lose energy if they didn't eat when hungry. The girls kept their lips tightly shut, not wanting to be the first to suggest giving up, but if someone did, they would likely all agree.

Eizel understood the psychology of teenage girls very well.

"Since it's getting late, should we just find a nearby restaurant?"

"Uh… yeah, let's do that."

"Since it's late…"

The girls were about to reluctantly agree when Marillen suddenly lifted her head and gently shook Eizel's arm.

"Eizel, isn't that it?"

"Huh?"

Eizel turned her gaze to where Marillen was pointing and saw a peculiar building with large orange letters spelling out 'Witch's Restaurant.'

"…It really is."

She hadn't expected it to be in such a gloomy, secluded alley. Most buildings in Arcanium were colorful and beautifully decorated, but the Witch's Restaurant was dark and eerie. It was surprising that people would go to such a place to eat when there were many better-looking restaurants nearby.

"Since we found it, let's go."

"Great! As they say, good things come after hard work!"

The girls slowly approached the Witch's Restaurant.

"Wow…"

"It's beautifully decorated."

These days, interior design is said to account for more than half of a restaurant's image, and this place was no exception. The atmosphere was dark and gloomy, fitting the name 'Witch,' but the purple and orange lighting gave it a dreamy feel, and the beautifully inscribed magical phrases on the walls added to the mysterious ambiance.

"If you didn't feel lacking in living today, you are still happy."

It was a very old language. Perhaps it was used in ancient Criston about 400 years ago. Eizel, who had studied various disciplines, could interpret it at once, but most… no, all the students here wouldn't recognize it.

"What does that phrase mean?"

"Isn't it like a witch's magic spell?"

"No way. Witches don't use spells."

"Really? I heard witches were the origin of spells."

Even though Stella's students studied witches, it didn't mean they knew them well. In other words, even Stella's students didn't know much about witches, meaning that witches were that much shrouded in mystery in the magical world. Witches were mysterious but dangerous, full of secrets, and there was more unknown about them than known. Most had disappeared, so there was no way to learn more about them now.

"Are there no other customers?"

The restaurant was quite spacious, but there were no other customers besides the girls.

"Order, please!"

Marillen shouted loudly as she took a seat, making Eizel feel extremely embarrassed.

"There's a bell…"

"Oh, right."

Marillen found the bell and pressed it, and a waitress dressed in a witch's costume, like something out of a comic, appeared.

"May I take your order?"

The waitress smiled brightly, and there was something strangely captivating about her.

'What's with these menu names?'

Eizel frowned. Fantasy Witch Curry. Fantasy Witch Burger. Fantasy Witch Spaghetti, and so on. There was no shortage of dishes, but all the menu items had 'fantasy' attached to them without any unique characteristics.

"I'll have this."

"I'll have the burger!"

After her friends finished ordering, the waitress smiled brightly and made eye contact with Eizel.

"And for you, miss?"

Eizel quietly looked at the menu and pointed to 'Fantasy Witch Pork Soup.'

"This one…"

She had a terrible experience with it last time, but since this restaurant was famous for making everything delicious, she thought it might be different.

"Got it."

After the waitress left, the girls huddled together and whispered quietly.

"Hey, who was that lady?"

"Why is she so pretty?"

"Seriously, she's almost as pretty as Eizel."

"…Why do you keep bringing up my name?"

However, Eizel felt something was off. The waitress was indeed attractive, but not to the extent that her friends were making a fuss over. She had a plain appearance, but her smile was captivating… just that kind of feeling. But since everyone finds different things attractive, Eizel thought it was just her being peculiar and let it go.

After a while, the food arrived, and before eating, her friends took pictures of the dishes with high-performance cameras. They probably wanted to show off to their school friends. Eizel didn't feel the need to boast, but she let her friends take pictures.

"Eizel, what is this dish? Rice in soup?"

"I don't know either."

She didn't know, but she planned to eat it. After taking pictures, her friends picked up their knives and forks and started eating, showing exaggerated reactions.

"This is insane!"

"This is heaven…"

It must be really delicious. Eizel also took a spoonful of the pork soup but…

'Hmm…'

It still didn't suit her taste. It was no different from the restaurant she went to with Baek Yuseol last time. She wondered if the pork soup had its limitations, so she tried a bite of her friends' dishes.

'…They're all ordinary.'

Eizel didn't have a refined palate. After losing her father, she had been eating the cheapest and most efficient food, so she wasn't picky. But the food at the Witch's Restaurant was… honestly, it was so ordinary that it was almost bland. Eizel could eat anything, but if a noble student had come, they would have spat it out immediately.

"This is insane. Seriously!"

But her friends were shoveling the food into their mouths as if they were possessed.

"Is it really that good?"

"Yeah, yeah. Didn't you like it?"

"It was just ordinary."

"This is the first time I've been to a restaurant like this…"

"Even at a star chef's restaurant, I haven't tasted anything like this."

Was it really that good? She didn't know. Maybe her taste buds were so cheap that she couldn't appreciate good food? While Eizel was pondering, the meal ended, and the girls patted their bellies, looking satisfied.

"Ah~ Let's come again."

"I want to come here every day."

"Should we ask the waitress how to find this place again?"

"Shall we?"

The girls went to the counter to pay and subtly asked the waitress.

"How do we find this place?"

But the waitress just smiled and shook her head.

"Well, I don't know the directions either. But if you want to find it, you can always find it, so don't worry."

What kind of vague answer was that? But her friends quickly accepted it and left the restaurant. It felt like they were really under a witch's spell. Eizel also followed her friends out, but suddenly the waitress stopped her.

"Wait a moment."

"Yes?"

"You are… like me, aren't you?"

What was she talking about?

"That's right. I can clearly feel the witch's aura from you."

"That's a relief."

The waitress smiled brightly. What was so relieving? Eizel didn't understand, but the waitress bowed her head in greeting.

"Then, take care. I hope to see you again."

"…Okay. I'll be going."

Feeling uneasy, Eizel hurriedly left the place. 

"Phew…"

She realized her back was drenched in cold sweat.

"What was that…"

It felt ominous, but as long as she didn't come back, there shouldn't be any problems.

…Late evening. Stella Academy, teaching materials storage. A commotion was happening in Wand Storage Room 11097.

"Professor Valentine, even though you are in charge of all the wands, asking us to take out all the wands is too much."

"Well, I lost an important wand here."

"We've searched for the wand you mentioned for a long time. But we couldn't find such a wand."

"Come on, you guys can't find it. How can you miss something so noticeable?"

Professor Valentine. She was the professor of 'Efficient Use of Wands' and also the manager in charge of all the wands used by students at Stella Academy. But even a manager couldn't order all the wands to be taken out and laid out. Wands that were not in resonance with a wizard were very sensitive, and some wands could even have seizures just by being exposed to the air.

"Ugh, you guys are so frustrating."

Valentine, with her lively bronze skin, ruffled her reddish curly hair in frustration. The situation was already frustrating, and the wand she lost was very dangerous and precious, making her even more anxious.

'Where did I lose it?'

A few days ago, she had secretly used the 'broomstick wand' with Instructor Ihanwol to create an environment for the students' practice in the Stella Dome, but she was so drunk that day that she couldn't remember where she put it.

'It wasn't there when I looked for it after the practice…'

She usually stored wands in the storage room, so she searched every corner of the place, but it was nowhere to be found.

'Did someone pick it up?'

The thought made her shiver. If someone had picked up that wand…

…No! Even if someone did, they wouldn't recognize it.

Valentine waved her hand at the staff.

"Forget it. I'll go back. Let me know if you find it."

"Yes, understood."

She wanted to smash the staff member's head like a pumpkin for answering so nonchalantly, but she held back. Did that idiot even understand how important this was?

"Sigh~ My fate…"

Finding the lost wand was just a matter of time. She just hoped that no one would mess with it and cause unnecessary trouble in the process.
