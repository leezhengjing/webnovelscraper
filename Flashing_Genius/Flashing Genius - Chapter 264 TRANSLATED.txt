# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy
## Chapter 264: The Noble Soul (14)

**Absolute Invincible Cheolribeon.** 

A truly unique black magician. Among the countless characters in 'Aither World Online,' he might be the most distinctive. At one time, players couldn't categorize characters' abilities simply by their class or risk level, so they jokingly quantified combat power. Combat power included attack power, defense power, speed, and utility, based on players' subjective opinions. However, the most crucial aspects were 'magic attack power' and 'defense power.'

For a 9th-class magician, the average combat power was around 100. Eltman Eltwin had an attack power of 120 and a defense power of 80, while Hwaseorin had an attack power of 90 and a defense power of 130. Most players found these combat power calculations reasonably accurate, though there were, of course, dissenting opinions. After all, it was subjective.

However, there was one combat power that everyone agreed upon: **Cheolribeon.**

- 9th Risk Black Magician
- Magic Attack Power: 10
- Magic Defense Power: 300

Cheolribeon was indeed peculiar. His attack power was only at the level of a novice magician, but his defense power was the strongest in the land. Simply put, it meant that even two or three 9th-class magicians combined couldn't break through Cheolribeon's defense with pure attack power alone. Wasn't that cheating? Not necessarily.

**Trait: [Thought Control]** - The ability to control and dominate the opponent's magic, making it his own.

**Skill: [Blessing of the Dark Moon]** - The ability to perfectly defend against and counter all types of attacks.

The essence of Cheolribeon's two abilities lay not in himself but in his opponents. In other words, even if Cheolribeon intended to kill someone, if the opponent only defended without counterattacking, the battle would remain undecided.

But what if Cheolribeon lost all his defensive abilities? If the extreme scenario of facing two 9th-class magicians simultaneously, causing cracks in his 'absolute defense,' actually occurred?

"Oh my, even the absolute invincible Cheolribeon gets hurt when his shield is stripped away?"

"…Cough!"

At Soya's mocking tone, Cheolribeon wiped the blood trickling from his mouth with his sleeve.

"A spirit slayer…."

Unlike when he faced Aryumun and Hwaseorin before, Cheolribeon's eyes were now filled with a murderous calm. But Soya just smiled with her eyes. The Cheolribeon before her was nothing more than a toothless tiger.

'That kid's words were true.'

Baek Yuseol had told her about Cheolribeon's weakness, which was surprisingly simple. He said Cheolribeon's weakness wasn't a specific vulnerability or trauma but his 'personality.'

'He fights with all his might, no matter who the opponent is… For someone with 100 power to defeat someone with 10 power, using just 15 power would be enough. But Cheolribeon can't do that. His 'absolute defense' isn't that convenient. Even if he meets an opponent who poses only a 1 threat, he fights with all his 300 power. What if the opponent is two 9th-class magicians?'

"How does it feel to have your proud shield broken? Hm?"

As Soya smiled brightly and spoke, Cheolribeon clenched and unclenched his fists, checking his mana.

'So, you were waiting for an opportunity.'

Until now, he had been chasing the spirit slayer to kill her, but he never considered the possibility that the prey might attack him. Any black magician would know that he possessed an invincible body. But what if Aryumun and Hwaseorin had anticipated his approach? Even if he didn't know how they got the information, it wasn't unreasonable to think they might counterattack. Currently, his mana was almost depleted, making it difficult to activate even the 'Blessing of the Dark Moon' a few times.

'Fast information and good judgment.'

Strange. Soya, the spirit slayer. She might seem like a formidable black magician on the surface, but according to Cheolribeon's insight, she lacked exceptional intelligence. Planning? Strategy? A foolish woman who would risk her life for immediate pleasure couldn't possibly do that.

"Who is behind you?"

When Cheolribeon asked in a low voice, Soya's eyebrows twitched. She was momentarily overwhelmed by his pressure.

"Behind me? Huh, do you think I have someone like that? I move solely by my own will!"

"Well…"

"Now you're bluffing when you don't even have any strength left!"

Soya raised her arms high. A black magic circle tinged with red swirled unpleasantly. It was entirely different from the magic used by ordinary magicians. It was a persona magic created by black magicians through contracts with the 'Other World' and fused with witches' magic.

**[Thought Interference]**

Soya smirked.

'No problem. I can do it.'

In the distant past, she had even brought down the spirit Yiphanell with this power. Although Yiphanell was in a completely defenseless state just before transitioning from a divine beast to a spirit at that time, she had still won.

'I can corrupt even a spirit!'

Creak! Crack!

Soya's black magic spread everywhere, slowly engulfing everything. Rocks, trees, grass, flowers, butterflies, pigeons, cicadas, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide. There were many visible and invisible things around, and people collectively referred to all of them as 'all things.'

Her ability was to interfere with all things in this world. She could turn living humans into puppets, corpses into clones, and even steal the hearts of spirits.

'I'm the only one in this world who has combined the magic of the Other World and witches' magic!'

Even if she wanted to lose, she couldn't. She had to sacrifice an overwhelming lifespan to use magic, but if she could deal with Cheolribeon, she could perfectly absorb the 'heart of the spirit.' She might even obtain an immortal body without the limitation of lifespan.

'If I can get rid of the limitation of lifespan, I will be invincible!'

Boom, boom!!

Invisible air clenched its fist tightly, binding Cheolribeon, and carbon rose from the ground, gripping his ankles with diamond-like hardness, making it impossible for him to move.

Whoosh!!

The wind blew artificially. Clouds in the sky began to gather slowly above Cheolribeon's head. She couldn't control the climate, but...

Crack, crackle!!!

Striking lightning was very easy for her.

Rumble-!

The ground shook like a vortex, pulling Cheolribeon underground. Interfering with all things meant controlling the elements themselves. It was truly...

"Isn't it like the power of a god? Don't you think so, Baek Yuseol?"

Soya shouted as she raised her black magic. 'If only the limitation of lifespan were gone, I would be...!'

She could become truly invincible. She thought so until time suddenly stopped.

"Uh..."

The swirling air and leaves, the vortex-like ground, and the writhing clouds. Everything stopped.

'What is this...?'

Did time stop? No. It was an illusion. Time didn't stop. All the things she had interfered with escaped her control and stopped under someone else's will.

'What...?' Her pupils trembled greatly. She took a step back, and the sound of rustling grass was clearly heard. If time had really stopped, there wouldn't be any sound. So, this was...

'It's like time stopped... Thought Interference...?'

Thought Interference. A superior ability that surpassed her great power to control all things.

**[Thought Control]**

Rustle!

The vortex of the earth that had risen to the sky settled down, and the fierce struggle of the air subsided. And there stood Cheolribeon. He touched a leaf suspended in the air with a tired expression.

"Do you know?"

"What..."

Cheolribeon flicked the leaf with his finger. With that simple motion, the leaf split in half.

"What..."

At that moment of doubt, at that moment...

"Ugh... Aaaah!!"

Soya clutched her throat and collapsed, gasping in pain. Her throat? Was the source of the pain her throat? Her wrist? Her waist? Her thigh? Her head? She couldn't understand. She was clearly in pain, but she couldn't pinpoint the exact source of the pain.

"To interfere with all things, you must imbue your soul into them..."

Cheolribeon's voice was soft and somewhat bored.

"That's the limit of 'interference.'"

What was he talking about? She tried to speak, but she couldn't. When Cheolribeon lifted his foot and crushed a stone, it felt as if her heart had burst, and the agony consumed her entire body.

"Cough..."

Soya, drooling and writhing on the ground, twisted her body.

"Cough, cough..."

She had to release the Thought Interference. She had to retrieve all her black magic. But she couldn't.

"Sorry, but I've already controlled everything. You should give up any foolish thoughts."

Abilities that interfered with others were rare. But if such magicians met each other, they had to make a wise judgment. If the opponent's ability was a superior version, their own ability would be completely sealed. Of course, it couldn't be said that Cheolribeon's ability was a perfect superior version of Soya's. It was just a difference in 'experience.'

At first, he could only control a single leaf. Even with such a trashy ability, since it was all he had, Cheolribeon trained his Thought Control to the extreme. He trained and trained to survive. As a result, Cheolribeon honed his Thought Control to the limit. Could Soya possibly overcome such a Cheolribeon? Absolutely not. It was purely a difference in experience and proficiency.

Soya, despite having the upper hand, was having all her abilities trampled due to that simple difference.

Crack!

Breaking trees, scattering air, and crushing stones made Soya tremble and convulse. She couldn't even faint. Cheolribeon knew exactly when a black magician would die and when they would lose consciousness. Knowing that, he spent a long time gnawing at Soya's soul.

"Killing a spirit... That's truly a vile act, isn't it?"

You're a black magician. Why are you siding with the spirits? Soya wanted to ask, but she couldn't open her mouth. The sensation she assumed was her mouth was synchronized with the stone at Cheolribeon's feet, shattering into pieces.

"Spirits are beings you shouldn't touch. I've been chasing you for a long time. And finally, today, like fate, we meet."

Cheolribeon, who finally reached Soya, looked down at her with disgust, as if looking at a bug.

"Isn't it tragic? I didn't know either. That our abilities would overlap like this..."

Both Soya and Cheolribeon had thoroughly hidden the true names of their abilities.

"But this is... truly alien. It doesn't feel good. Even though I caught you. I keep thinking that someone who knows us very well intentionally created this situation."

Soya, who knew how to save her own life, had survived as a fugitive for so many years. Such a woman suddenly attacking him? Someone must have disturbed Soya's rationality. Tempted her with sweet words.

"Don't you think so? You, who have been hiding and watching from earlier."

Cheolribeon raised his head and looked somewhere. It was impossible to sense with conventional magic detection, but thanks to Thought Control, he could be sure.

"You tried to control this entire area. But there was one part, the space where you are standing, that couldn't be controlled."

It was a perplexing experience even for Cheolribeon. At his words, a boy appeared from a distance. Wearing the uniform of Stella Academy. Even though he had lived away from the secular world for a long time, he could easily recognize it. And his identity as well.

"Baek Yuseol. I've heard the rumors..."

Looking at the boy's darkened face, Cheolribeon smiled for the first time in a while.

"You are more dangerous than I thought."
