# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy's Front Blink

## Chapter 199: Gambling with Time (2)

The meeting between Eijel and Flame was purely coincidental.

"How did you get in here? I found this place by accident too."

"Oh, did you get lost like me?"

It was inevitable, especially if they met in the secret space of the library at a time when people were scarce. However, for Flame, it was not a coincidence but an intentional meeting. She had guessed that Eijel would be here around this time and had entered the secret space without any effort, recalling the knowledge of the novel.

"Just... uh, yeah. I found it by accident."

"Right? Anyway, the librarian leaves early, so we can stay a bit longer."

"They probably don't even know we're here. That librarian doesn't bother to record anything because it's a hassle."

Eijel chattered excitedly, satisfied with the fact that she could read a little more. Her sweet voice had a strangely soothing power, but it couldn't ease Flame's bitter heart.

"...What were you reading?"

"Oh, look at this. I recently got interested in the Twelve Sacred Months. You know the incident that happened on the coast of Levian, right? It was actually because of the curse of the Bronze Twelve Months."

The curious girl had a personality that dug into anything she was curious about.

"And then, coincidentally, there was a book about the Twelve Sacred Months here. Well... it seems like it only investigates folk beliefs, though."

Eijel probably didn't know. The book she was holding was something that only a very few professors at Stella could read, and it was written by none other than Principal Eltman Eltwin himself.

A hundred years ago, when Eltman Eltwin, who was active in his prime, sensed it was time to retire, he traveled the world. During that process, he met countless heroes, recluses, mysterious beings, and legendary animals. Among those special encounters was the 'Twelve Sacred Months.'

One would think that a mythical existence like the Twelve Sacred Months wouldn't be detailed in a school library. Like Eijel thought. But this place was not accessible to just anyone. Eijel, who had 'coincidentally' reached here by walking naturally, had no idea.

"Sounds interesting."

"Do you want to read it together?"

From the moment Eijel started reading that book, her tragedy began. The best way to prevent it was to stop her from reading that book.

"Really? I'm curious. Can I see it for a moment?"

"Here you go."

Eijel handed over the book without a hint of suspicion. Flame stared at the book in her hand and pondered briefly. She was certain. The moment Eijel touched this, she would not have a good future. Probably... Eijel, who learned the 'truth,' would live like a wreck, wasting her years. Not even Baek Yuseol could stop that kind of thing. Because the tragedies stemming from the truth couldn't be prevented.

However, there was one way to stop it right now. By investing just a little mana to tear this book apart. If she did that, Eijel would never know why her father died and the secret within.

'...Let's tear it apart.'

It was an unavoidable choice. It might be better for her to live without knowing anything.

...But then.

"Oh, I read the middle part first. There's a very interesting part."

"...What?"

"That book deals with the 'Silver Eleven Months' among the Twelve Sacred Months."

"You read it? Already?"

"Huh? Yes? Yes... Is that not allowed?"

Flame's body trembled greatly, but Eijel continued without noticing.

"Anyway, just like the Bronze Twelve Months left the 'Heart of Winter' as their fragment and the Red Summer Month left the 'Fire Spirit Flower' as their fragment, the Silver Eleven Months did the same. Some of those sacred items can glimpse past events... Huh? Flame, what's wrong?"

"...It's nothing."

It was too late. Since she already knew that much, there was no reason to stop her. Flame stared blankly at the book with a despondent expression.

"So, well... there's still some time left until summer vacation, right? So, I'm thinking of going to find it myself."

"...You're going to find it?"

"Yes... It sounds a bit foolish, right? I'm just thinking of it as a trip to change my mood. I don't even know if it really exists."

Yeah, it really does sound foolish.

"You never know, right? If this really exists, I might be able to reveal the truth about my father to the world!"

Eijel's father, Isaac Morf, was killed by the Adolevit royal family, bearing the most disgraceful insult in the magic world as a black magic traitor. For the past ten years, Eijel had repeatedly claimed her father's innocence, but the magic world did not accept it. So, she had been waiting, growing her own strength. To reveal the truth to the world and clear her father's unjust accusations.

"So, I'm willing to try anything if there's even a little hope."

"I see."

Flame nodded with a determined expression and then spoke to her in a firm voice, as if she had made up her mind.

"Then I'll go with you."

"...What?"

"You said it feels like a trip, right? I've been under a lot of stress lately, so it's perfect."

"T-Together? I can go alone..."

"We're going together. Just know that."

Flame declared and then turned around to leave the library.

"Hey, wait!"

Eijel's flustered voice was heard, but she didn't care. If Eijel was determined to follow the original story... Flame thought she would accompany her through that process.

* * *

The Cradle of the Celestial Tree, the White Castle.

"Yawn... The Queen's personal guard, Lime Taesung, yawned widely and wiped away the tears that flowed out. Just because he was the knight closest to the Queen didn't mean he always had to show a proper appearance, right?

"Taesung. I told you to maintain your dignity in the White Castle."

On the other hand, his twin sister, Lime Taeseon, always showed a disciplined appearance and scolded her brother.

"Oh, right... Lime Taesung tried to gather his staff to his chest and pretend to be dignified. But that didn't change his lazy and sleepy attitude. 'I'm tired...'

Lime Taesung, one of the two knights who protected the Queen most closely, had lived in a cabin deep in the forest for many years for Flower Serin. Perhaps because of the habit of living there for so many years, he didn't care about others' gazes at all, and as a result, he had become completely lazy. Of course, despite that, his skills were solid, and he had been assisting the Queen for a long time, so he hadn't lost Flower Serin's trust. But from his sister Lime Taeseon's perspective, his attitude was very displeasing.

"The Queen... is working hard again today..."

"Yeah. It's a good sight."

When they peeked into the Queen's office, they saw Flower Serin, who was busy working from morning till night without a break. Her appearance, dressed in a black veil and dress, running around busily, was quite awkward from Lime Taesung's perspective, who had been by her side all his life.

"Thanks to that, the Elder Council's position has significantly decreased lately."

At Taeseon's words, Taesung chuckled.

"Those rude old men were running wild while Her Majesty was away, weren't they?"

"That's right."

When the Queen was absent for a long time, the power of the High Elf Elder Council naturally increased. For decades, they had been doing whatever they wanted, but when the Queen suddenly appeared and started correcting all the rules, the Elder Council was very dissatisfied these days. But what could they do? They couldn't go against the one closest to the World Tree.

"Paenal. I told you to remove the Elder Council's certification mark from this document. When the Queen's direct department does something, there's no need to get the Elder Council's permission."

"Well, it has always been like that. For over 30 years, we've followed this tradition..."

"Always? Did you say always?"

Oh no. Taesung held his forehead. The word 'always' was what the Queen hated the most. The elf race was inherently extremely afraid of change, and they had maintained a very conservative culture for a long time without changing the things that had 'always' been that way. It was Flower Serin who broke that. The young High Elves who had recently joined seemed to be unaware of that.

"It wasn't like that when I was here. Change it immediately."

When she started to overhaul the ridiculous rule that they had to get the Elder Council's permission for everything done in the White Castle, some officials made faces as if they had chewed on something bitter. Flower Serin observed each of their expressions. Perhaps because she weakened the 'Connection of Affection' and activated the 'Blessing of Spring in March,' she could properly read the inner thoughts and emotions revealed in their expressions.

'...I need to root out the Elder Council as soon as possible.'

Her decision was quick.

"Meidi? We need to conduct a full investigation of the internal officials. Bring me the list of officials by evening."

"Y-Yes!"

When the girl named Meidi, who had newly taken the position of assistant, answered hurriedly, the officials' faces turned pale.

"Wow~ The Queen has charisma."

"...Indeed. I've never seen Her Majesty like that."

When they thought of Flower Serin, who used to live quietly in the cabin, she was just a pure girl who loved flowers. She feared going outside but longed for a normal life more than anyone else. She loved sunlight but was afraid to lift her head. Such a delicate girl. But that was a misconception because they had only seen the timid Flower Serin who lived in hiding.

As the Elf Queen, Flower Serin was different. She had the charisma and leadership required of a queen, and she had the decisiveness to overturn and change the deeply rooted culture. Honestly, now that she had returned to the Queen's position, Flower Serin showed a cold and fierce side every day, to the point where even Lime Taesung and Lime Taeseon, who were 7th-class wizards, occasionally got scared.

"Still, I think Her Majesty looks even cooler like this."

"...Really?"

"Yes. It looks like she's doing what she wants. She looks happy."

Seeing her live each day with a clear goal and passion, unlike when she was just enduring each day, was quite touching from the perspective of the two knights who always guarded her side. So, they believed that Flower Serin would continue to live as a dignified queen. She had initiated a great transformation by overhauling the rotten laws of the palace, actively engaging in cultural exchanges with many countries worldwide, and raising the status of the elves. They firmly believed that she would forever rule the World Tree as a charismatic Elf Queen.

Taesung, Taeseon. I'm sorry. I have a special guest tonight, so I'll be going out. I'll be back soon, so don't worry!

...One night. Before the Queen left a childish note and escaped the castle secretly, unbeknownst to the guards.

"What is this?!"

Realizing belatedly that the Queen was missing, Lime Taesung screamed, and Taeseon collapsed into her seat.

"Your Majesty...? This is a lie..."

Their hearts sank at the Queen's reckless action.
