The purification ceremony had ended without incident. While it was called a purification ceremony, it was actually a process to reseal Isaac Morph’s body, but in any case, Hong Biyeon had successfully fulfilled her role. Despite her being only a 4th-class mage, the nobles were shocked that Princess Hong Biyeon was able to flawlessly execute the Fire Spirit Formation. However, they didn’t show it on the surface. For their princess to become queen, Hong Biyeon had to disappear. Her reputation was growing, making the situation within the royal family chaotic. They didn’t want to stir up any trouble.

“Good work, princess.” As Hong Biyeon slowly caught her breath after withdrawing the Fire Spirit Formation, Taeribeon approached her with his usual sickening smile. “Oh, dear. You’re sweating a lot. Do you need a handkerchief?” “I don’t need one.” Looking at him, she quickly realized why the royal head mage was just playing the role of an innkeeper here. ‘He’s not old enough to retire.’ She thought he must have a reason for his sudden change of heart. Thinking back, Taeribeon was an ambitious man. Why would he suddenly retire? That wasn’t possible. ‘He was studying permanent chill here… and the fact that he hasn’t returned yet means he hasn’t figured out why the chill is leaking out of Isaac Morph’s body.’ ‘Heungsihwa. It was thanks to this altar that she was able to move around freely all this time.’ After completely ending the ceremony and dismissing the mages, Hong Biyeon boarded her private airship and organized her thoughts. Normally, the descendants of the Adollevit family couldn’t live past their 20s.  It was unless they gave up magic entirely like her mother, or if they didn’t have the talent for fire magic, which wasn’t the case for Heungsihwa. ‘She’s extending her lifespan by absorbing the chill… in other words, if this altar is gone, Heungsihwa’s pathetic life can be cut short naturally.’ This realization made her disgusted. She was thinking just like Heungsihwa.  ‘I won’t get my hands dirty.’  Besides, destroying this altar would mean disposing of Isaac Morph’s body… ‘…that’s not ideal either.’  Was it for Aizel? No. It was because she once admired Isaac Morph and wanted to respect him until the very end. ‘A man who sacrificed himself to protect his family, the world, and his daughter… who could easily make such a decision?’ Isaac Morph, the man she saw in her memories, shouldn’t be insulted like that.

*Crack!* Blood seeped out of her clenched fist. She couldn’t forgive Heungsihwa and Queen Hong Seoryu for insulting Isaac, but there was nothing she could do for now. She had to endure it. She had to endure, persevere, and survive. On the day she graduated from Stella Academy, she would become queen and get her revenge. ‘I will… definitely.’

Monday morning, getting a sudden order to assemble from the instructor would naturally lead to complaints. “Are we dogs?” “Who the hell does he think he is to tell us what to do?” “That old geezer is such a pain.” Of course, there was no student who would dare to directly voice such complaints to the instructor. It was only natural. “Quiet down!” The students of Class A and Class S gathered in the Stella Dome looked up at Heslon, the instructor, who was floating in the air with a terrifying expression and his arms crossed behind his back. They were calling him an old geezer and whatnot, but Heslon was also a legendary mage, a war hero, so no one dared to talk back to him.

“I assume you’ve all received sufficient practical training until last week.” Hearing that, Baek Yuseol yawned widely and thought. ‘Did I receive any practical training…?’ She had experienced something more intense than training, but she couldn’t remember anything other than skipping class for the past few days. “There’s no point in practicing any further. You’re getting tired of the boring repetition, and we’re not having fun because we’re not making any progress. Therefore, starting with Class S, I will assign you real-life missions in order.”  Heslon’s words caused the students to murmur. The word ‘sufficient practical training’ was a misnomer. They hadn’t actually practiced properly since the semester started. They had studied theory intensively in the first semester, but it had only been a few weeks since the second semester began, and now they were already going out on real missions? But this was the Stella way.  They sent Class A and Class S, the highest-ranking students, on missions first, giving them real-life experience to accelerate their growth.  Then, after 1 to 2 weeks, when they felt like they had had enough practice, they would send Class B and below on real missions. That was Stella’s plan.

“Ugh, my brother said there wasn’t anything like this last year…” “I’m confident. I can hit the running wooden dummies 8 out of 10 times now.” “You idiot. Monsters aren’t like wooden dummies.”  It was understandable that the best students in Class A and Class S would be sent on real missions, and good results could be expected. But to be honest, Baek Yuseol thought that they were all pretty much the same.  ‘What was it like in the game…?’ She pondered for a moment. ‘I don’t remember…?’ She’d forgotten. As far as she recalled, it wasn’t a particularly impactful episode. It was a fleeting story that happened before the League of Spirits began. Black mages were involved, but it wasn’t a particularly dangerous problem.  Of course, that was just the original story. The current reality was so different from the original game. Even if she knew the future, she needed to prepare herself no matter what.

-Practical training?  She listened to Heslon’s words with one ear and let them out the other, but a clear, refreshing voice echoed in her mind. It was Iphainel. ‘Oh, practical training. You’re awake now?’

-Yeah, practical training. But I’m sleepy again.

She and Baek Yuseol were connected by their hearts and souls. So it should have been possible for them to have telepathy from the start, but until now, Iphainel had been recovering her strength.  Even when she regained a certain amount of strength, the protection of Yeonhongchunsamwol had become so strong that her mind was completely blocked.  But Baek Yuseol could now connect mentally with Iphainel because she had loosened the protection of Yeonhongchunsamwol somewhat.  Of course, it wasn’t always connected. This process required a lot of mental energy. Most importantly, it was essential that Iphainel was awake. ‘How much have you recovered…?’

She was still corrupted by the darkness and hadn’t fully recovered. She was struggling to recover her strength, let alone purify her magical energy. She couldn’t imagine how difficult and agonizing it must be for her right now, but as always, Iphainel’s voice was bright and cheerful.

-Yeah! I’m okay! Yuseol’s friend came to find my heart, so it’ll be quick! 

‘…Is that so?’ She was probably talking about Cheolribeon.  Even though she told him countless times that he wasn’t her friend, Iphainel considered everyone she could talk to as a friend. For her, there were only two people she could talk to, and she called them both friends. She understood why she was acting this way. ‘By the way, why did he give back her heart?’

Cheolribeon, the invincible, is neither good nor evil, he is neutral. You could say he’s similar to Mayuseong, but Mayuseong tends to turn to the dark side, while Cheolribeon remains neutral no matter what happens.  He hated doing anything troublesome, but for some reason, he kept hunting down specific black mages. In the process, he excluded anything unnecessary. It was because he didn’t want to unnecessarily expose himself and cause more innocent killings. ‘I don’t know why, but it’s all good.’

-Yeah. It’s all good!

‘So do you have two hearts now? Are you Park Jisung?’

-Huh?  No.  I need to absorb it, but it’s still too contaminated…  So…

‘Dishwashing?’

-Yeah!  I’m washing my heart!

Because she couldn’t go out into society, Iphainel would sometimes get confused about word choice. Whenever that happened, Baek Yuseol would just throw out any random word, and Iphainel would smile brightly and say it was right. It was sometimes fun to tease her, but it made Baek Yuseol feel a little guilty.

-Yawwwwn… I’m sleepy.

‘Go to sleep.’

-Yeah. See you later…

Iphainel seemed to be getting sleepy again. She was chattering away, but then she suddenly cut off her mental connection and fell asleep. She must have been too busy all day purifying the turbidity, cleansing the contamination in her heart, and polishing the spirit heart to get any rest. But thankfully, once she completely finishes purifying the turbidity, she’ll be able to go out whenever she wants. Having regained the spirit heart, she wouldn’t be able to use her overwhelming powers of the past. But as a spirit, she could finally break free from the limitations of Namu and walk freely on her own two feet.  No one knew when that would be, but thanks to the barrier created by Cotsarin’s magic, no one would be able to interfere with her in the garden, so it should be soon.

“Now, I’ll break down the types of missions.” Heslon had finally finished talking and was getting to the point. “First, dungeon exploration. Second, destroying the Persona Gate. Third, killing black mages. Fourth, hunting monsters.” All four options were missions that any mage warrior could experience. “Killing black mages is a real-life mission for second-year students, so it’s excluded. You have the opportunity to choose from the three options. You can form a team of one to six people, but remember that a teacher will be monitoring your mission performance.” 

She could remember this part clearly, thanks to her rectangular glasses. In the original game, Mayuseong usually went on a mission to destroy the Persona Gate alone, Haewonryang went on a dungeon exploration mission with Aizel, and Full Flame… ‘Pungharang?’ He was recorded as going on a mission to hunt monsters with a boy named Pungharang from Class S. ‘Oh yeah, there was this kid.’ He was a minor supporting character who appeared in the latter half of the semester, so she didn’t remember much about him. But his impact was definitely memorable.  At the end of the first semester, before winter break began, he confessed his feelings to Full Flame and got rejected, gaining the sympathy of many male players.  Some even said they felt a sense of empathy and the community was flooded with tears for a time. ‘Hmm, what should I do?’ Honestly, if dungeons and Persona Gates were real, she would have chosen them because they sounded fun. But to be honest, it was a pain. ‘I’ll just do the easy monster hunting or… Wait, what?’

She was blankly reading the mission application form that the instructor had given her when Hong Biyeon approached her from behind. With her arms crossed over her chest and her usual arrogant expression, she said to me. “Let’s go to the Persona Gate.”

“…Suddenly?”

“Yeah. You don’t want to?” She had an aura that said, ‘If you say no, I’ll kill you.’  I couldn’t dare to shake my head.  “No… I’m completely fine with it.  I’ve been waiting for this, I really wanted to go.” It was clearly a lie, but Hong Biyeon seemed happy with that and nodded with a smirk. “Alright, follow me quickly.”

“…Yes.”  She was trying to quickly finish the simplest and quickest monster hunting mission. But she ended up getting stuck with the most annoying Persona Gate mission.
