## Chapter 203: Gambling with Time (6)

### Soul Chess between Jelliel and Carmenset

The 7th-class mage, Kaderpilt, along with all the veteran expedition members, watched the scene with bated breath. The soul chess match between Jelliel and Carmenset unfolded in a truly peculiar manner. Was it because Jelliel was losing? No, if that were the case, they would have nodded and said, "As expected." On the contrary, it was surprising because Jelliel was holding her own against Carmenset.

"Miss Jelliel is... slightly ahead."

"She has pushed the legendary Carmenset into a defensive position..."

"Could it be that Miss Jelliel's chess skills are that good? Her opponent is Carmenset, the one who even defeated the creator of soul chess!"

Honestly, no one in the expedition believed Jelliel would win. Although she was a young genius and had shown great prowess in soul chess, the same could be said for the legendary Carmenset. He had earned the title of chess grandmaster in his teens, summoned the spirit of the soul chess creator in his twenties, and defeated him in his thirties. Even if Jelliel had earned the grandmaster title in her late teens, her opponent was a genius beyond her level and had lived for thousands of years. There was no way she could win. They thought she was just burning with competitive spirit.

- "This is... perplexing!"

Every move Carmenset made was blocked by Jelliel. It was as if she could predict his moves in advance, positioning her pieces perfectly. Prediction? Anticipation? Guesswork? Foresight? No, none of these words could describe it. Jelliel's chess was... almost prophetic.

"How?"

Everyone had the same thought, including the grand mage, the expedition members, Carmenset, and even Jelliel herself.

"How can I know his moves in advance?"

It was as if she could see all of Carmenset's moves laid out before her. She could see how he would move next, what strategy he was planning, and the intention behind each move. It felt like she had learned telepathy. Soon, she realized it wasn't a difficult problem. Previously, Jelliel had experienced her second defeat in life and had thoroughly analyzed and studied all the chess patterns and methods of her opponent, Baek Yuseol. It didn't take long for her to make his chess her own. She even went a step further, modifying and absorbing it with her own unique style.

Thus, she could understand. The ancient spirit of Carmenset played chess... just like Baek Yuseol. No, it wasn't just similar; it was exactly the same. The reason Jelliel had the upper hand? It was obvious. She had analyzed, dissected, and reassembled her opponent's moves countless times. She couldn't lose even if she wanted to. Carmenset's chess was undoubtedly powerful. He changed his patterns several times in a short period, causing her strategy to waver continuously. If she hadn't experienced chess with Baek Yuseol, could she have dared to challenge the monstrous intellect of Carmenset and won? ...Impossible.

Even knowing all the strategies, the thought of defeat lingered in her mind, indicating that his chess skills were not something a mere novice like her could challenge. However, despite her skills being far inferior to Carmenset's...

- "Hahaha! I lost!"

In the end, she won. This was also thanks to someone who wasn't even there. 

Boom!

As Jelliel's chess piece toppled Carmenset's king, he burst into hearty laughter.

- "I admit it! You are better than me! It's as if the god of chess has descended!"

"Oh...!"

"To be recognized by the spirit of Carmenset...!"

"I can't believe it..."

Those loyal to Jelliel were so moved that they knelt. Not only had their lady discovered a legendary relic, but she had also been acknowledged by the ancient spirit of Carmenset. When this fact is revealed to the world, it might garner as much attention as the sensational thesis bomb dropped by the young witches of Stella at the Aslan Seminar. However, Jelliel faced Carmenset with an expression devoid of joy.

- "Alright! You said you wanted 'eternal life,' right?"

"Yes. Give me the key to immortality."

- "Do you truly wish to live forever? No matter the cost?"

"...Yes. But not for me."

- "Hmm?"

"I want to give eternity to my father, not myself."

- "Oh...?"

Carmenset narrowed his eyes and stretched his lips into a wide grin.

- "Is that so...?"

Something felt unsettling. But thinking it was too late to turn back, Jelliel stiffened her neck and faced Carmenset. He laughed. His lips stretched further, his shoulders shook out of sync, and his disheveled hair flew in all directions. No sound was heard. It was as if he was holding back laughter, but he was actually laughing uproariously.

- "Kuh... So, your decision remains unchanged?"

A moment of hesitation. Jelliel looked back briefly. The 7th-class grand mage, Kaderpilt, was pounding the air with wide eyes. He was shouting something, but it couldn't be heard here.

"I'm sorry."

No matter how great a mage, he couldn't stop her now.

"Yes. I won't change my mind."

In the end, Jelliel nodded towards Carmenset.

Crack!

"Ah...?"

Suddenly, she felt something snap, and her legs gave way, causing her to collapse to the floor.

"Ugh..."

The world spun. It was like the time she visited a dark amusement park with her father as a child. Riding a carousel alone at midnight. Her father waved his hand. But the carousel kept spinning, making it impossible to face her father continuously.

"Dad."

Whizz, whizz. In the passing scenery, Jelliel kept searching for her father. The carousel spun faster and faster. Faster. Even faster. In the spinning scenery, she could no longer find her father.

"Ah."

Jelliel closed her eyes.

* * *

Hawol Plain.

Named after the phrase, "Even if you run a thousand miles, the plain stretches endlessly under the moonlight," it was so vast that nothing could be seen. Nowadays, trains have been developed to cross the thousands of kilometers of plain quickly, but in the old days, hundreds of tribes divided and ruled the land. The wolf beastmen Garam tribe, the cat beastmen Black Cat tribe, the frog beastmen Yuwa tribe, and many other diverse tribes lived in harmony. 

One absurd part is that the reason these warring tribes achieved harmony was not because they were tired of war, but because the Star Cloud Trading Company suddenly appeared one day and provided "financial therapy" to all the tribes. It may seem unbelievable, but sometimes reality is stranger than fiction.

Clatter, clatter!

"Oh...!"

"Wow..."

As the train passed through the cliff tracks and tunneled through the mountain, the view suddenly opened up, revealing a gigantic tree. Far away, a tree so enormous that it seemed to occupy half the world pierced through the clouds and stood tall.

The second World Tree, the Hawol Tree. Located at the center of the seven rivers that traverse the continent, it is also called the heart of the plain. Unlike the Celestial Tree, it is home to a conservative elf community that can be called "natural elves" in a fantasy world, along with many other races, making it the largest World Tree in terms of scale. This World Tree also communicates with the Elf King, Flower Serin, but it has a "tree keeper" who acts like a city hall. Of course, it doesn't govern. Elves, by nature, do not need rulers.

While everyone on the train was mesmerized by the Hawol Tree, I looked in the opposite direction. In the middle of the plain, there was a large village in harmony with nature. Moonlight Hills, Lotus Inn. In the center of the plain, a green stem grew unusually tall, with a giant pink lotus blooming at its top. That was the famous Lotus Inn. It was also the residence of the Twelve Zodiac, Silver Eleven Moon, and the most beautiful place in Hawol Plain.

- "Next stop, Moonlight Hills. Moonlight Hills Station. The door will open on the right."

The mechanical female voice broke the atmosphere. The people who had been staring at the World Tree quickly came to their senses and hurriedly prepared to disembark.

"...I should get going too."

Although I didn't come here for leisure, I was glad to have enjoyed the beautiful scenery thanks to the train journey.

* * *

The Lotus Inn, built atop a lotus blooming high in the sky. In ancient times, immortals who could walk on air enjoyed the scenery here, but nowadays, a modern magical elevator is installed inside the lotus stem, making it easily accessible to anyone. Perhaps because ordinary people were so captivated by this beautiful scenery, the Lotus Inn once became almost like Las Vegas, filled with gambling, with casino roulettes spinning and pachinko machines going off in the streets. Not anymore. After the Star Cloud Trading Company bought all the shares of the Lotus Inn, they closed all the gambling dens and restored the place to its former glory. Thanks to this, the immortals who had developed a taste for gambling disappeared, leaving only rumors behind. Believe it or not.

Thinking back, it must have been a funny sight. Immortals with beards down to their waists huddled around a roulette table, shouting "Let's go!" It's not something you can easily see, even if you pay for it.

"Do you have a single room?"

The Lotus Inn is now divided into many inns. From 1-star to 5-star, the quality of the inns varies, and I chose a 3-star inn.

"Hey, kid. Where would you find a single room? Of course, you can only get a double room."

...Was that so?

"Then I'll take that."

As I took out my wallet to receive the inn key, Stella's pocket watch came up with it. It wasn't a coincidence; it was intentional. Like those who post food photos on social media, subtly showing off their luxury watches and foreign car keys.

"Hmm? Are you a Stella student?"

"Yes."

"Ah, you're here for a visit?"

The innkeeper's expression changed. He thought I was an ordinary kid, but now he realized I was a noble's child, here for a visit.

"Well... yes? It looks like there's a lot of fun stuff here."

With the Star Cloud Trading Company's intervention, all illegal gambling at the Lotus Inn had disappeared. In other words, legal gambling still remained. Games like cards and dice were still available, and I had come here to participate in them.

"What would you like to try?"

"Poker sounds fun."

"Here you go. We give you 100 coins for free to start with, so give it a try."

"Oh..."

Did they always give this out? I don't remember since I haven't been here before. But it's obvious. They want to lure me in with a taste, thinking I'm a noble's child.

But there's no need to play such tricks on me.

"I'd like to exchange coins right away."

Thud! I placed a black 007 case on the table and opened it, revealing a stack of shining bills.

"Are you crazy...!"

The gamblers passing by widened their eyes and stared at me. The innkeeper, who hadn't seen such a big spender in a while, was momentarily flustered but quickly put on a business smile.

"Haha. Oh my, you're a VIP customer. You should have told me earlier. Did I give you a double room? Let me guide you to the VIP room!"

"I don't need that."

"Come on, this way. You said you wanted to play poker? I'll prepare the best gambler for you."

After saying that, the innkeeper gestured wildly behind his back. He probably thought it was out of my sight, but I could see it clearly with my intuition.

Swish! Several hidden agents moved, setting up a game for me. All this tedious process was to meet Silver Eleven Moon. Even if it cost money and time, it was a necessary step.

Well, let's get started.

...Just as I thought that.

Crash! A loud noise came from the next room, followed by someone's shout.

"You cheating old man! How dare you trick me! Guard! Guard, where are you! This old man cheated! How else could the nine of spades disappear!"

"Sir, please calm down."

"Calm down? How can I?"

I quickly headed in that direction. The guards, seeing the money I had shown, made way for me. In what seemed to be another VIP room, an old man was leisurely smoking a pipe, while a man in his thirties was shouting at him.

"Give me back my money!"

"Click, click. The young man is saying something interesting. What trick did I supposedly use?"

Although this place wasn't a casino, it was still a gambling den, so cheating would result in immediate expulsion. To prevent this, the place was equipped with the best mana detection sensors made by an 8th-class mage, and the innkeeper was a 7th-class mage, making magical cheating impossible. Even if Elteman Eltewin came, the mana detection sensors would go off the moment he used magic.

"So, did the sensors go off? The guards must have been watching my hands. Did they see anything strange?"

As the old man spoke arrogantly, the guards, sweating, shook their heads. Even the guards with excellent eyesight from the Garam tribe couldn't see anything, so it was safe to say there was no cheating. In other words, he had won the young man's money purely by skill.

"Ridiculous."

The old man's confident demeanor made me laugh. How could someone be so shameless? He was using a scam that couldn't even be compared to 9th-class spatial magic or a gambler's sleight of hand.

"Damn it, damn it...!"

Seeing the young man being dragged out by the guards, I quickly took his place.

"Hmm? Kid, who are you?"

Thud! There was no need to speak. Showing off superior wealth and chips, or rather, coins, was enough.

"Old man, let's have a game."

"Oh, I see... You seem confident."

As I threw down the gauntlet, the gambling old man, Silver Eleven Moon, seemed intrigued and raised the corners of his mouth.

"...Alright, this should be fun. Click, click."

Ting! He tossed me a coin, signaling the start of the game. The game was poker, the card game I was least confident in.
