# Chapter 173: The Seventh Tower (4)

Having read the original romance fantasy novel three times, Fullame remembered the major events that occurred within the Aether World quite well. Although she knew what would happen in the Seventh Tower, it was impossible to prepare detailed strategies. The genre being romance fantasy meant that battle scenes were often skipped or simplified, with most scenes focusing on character psychology. If Baek Yuseol were present, he might have suggested more effective strategies, but since he was absent, Fullame prepared as best as she could with her knowledge.

"The monsters appearing in the Seventh Tower are mostly of the dark attribute."

Fullame's light-based magic could be quite effective against them, but there was a significant difference compared to the holy attribute used by real angels or priests of the Holy Church. Since she had not yet realized the holy attribute due to her low level of magic, it was a wise decision to bring the 'Sacred Symbol' and holy water as countermeasures.

- Creak! Creak!
- Cackle! Cackle!

Strange noises filled the air as ghosts floated and shadows seeped in from all directions. Forgetting that Jeremy was following behind, Fullame and her party sprinted down the corridor to avoid them.

"Good thing I brought the symbol."

The Sacred Symbol was akin to a cross necklace in a church or prayer beads in Buddhism. However, unlike in reality, it actually possessed holy power. Although it was not mentioned in the original novel, it was indeed very effective in warding off the ghosts of the Seventh Tower.

Flash!

Whenever the circular symbol flashed, the approaching shadows and ghosts hesitated and retreated. However, since it wasn't an expensive symbol, its usage was limited.

"If I keep using it like this, it won't last long..."

She had spent her own money to bring as many symbols and holy water as possible, but it was still insufficient.

"Ah!"

As Anella stumbled while casting a spell, Fullame quickly threw a symbol at her. 

Crackle!

White sparks erupted, causing the ghosts approaching Anella to retreat.

"Get a grip! What are you doing?"

"S-Sorry..."

Anella, with a pale face, bit her lip. Although she specialized in delving into others' traumas and confusing them, she had little experience with direct combat, causing her mind to go blank.

"Even though I'm over 40... Despite my lack of combat experience, to be a burden to kids barely seventeen... The intense self-loathing surged like a wave, but there was no time to dwell on it.

"There's a lab nearby! Let's take refuge there!"

"Anella! Hurry!"

"Y-Yes... Ah!"

Fullame roughly grabbed Anella and almost threw her into the lab. Then, she thrust a symbol into her chest.

"Hold onto this. If you lose it, I'll kill you."

"...Thank you."

Despite her harsh words, Anella felt both gratitude and guilt for being given one of the few precious symbols. Being a burden was a truly miserable feeling.

"How's it outside?"

Approaching Eisel, who was guarding the door sealed with a magic circle drawn with holy water, Fullame asked. Eisel replied with a grim expression.

"It's full of ghosts. I never imagined there would be so many ghosts in Stella."

"This is bad... Other students must have been dragged to the Seventh Tower by now."

Was it this bad in the original novel? I don't know. There were no detailed descriptions. It was just mentioned that "Eisel was dragged to the Seventh Tower, tormented by ghosts, but was rescued by Haewonryang." There was no way to know what Eisel did inside or how many ghosts appeared.

"Should I have brought more symbols...?"

Even though I thought ten would be more than enough, there are only three left. We haven't even found Hong Biyeon yet.

"Where could she be..."

Biting her nails, Fullame recalled the original novel. Where was Professor Meizen Tiren? Although the exact location wasn't specified, she clearly remembered the description of a place with open space and windows on all sides, allowing a view of the sky. But was there such a place in Stella?

"...No, there is. The observatory on the top floor."

Every tower had a top floor, or rooftop, which was usually locked, preventing student access. Although she had never been to the rooftop, she knew what it looked like.

"So, we need to go to the rooftop..."

Boom! Boom!

Before she could finish her thought, the ghosts' assault began again. Eisel, with a strained expression, infused mana into the barrier at the door.

"Ugh...! The ghosts are occupying the space!"

"What? But I put holy water on the door..."

Realizing something, Fullame looked up. Dark mist was creeping into the lab. She finally understood. The Seventh Tower itself was a ghost story. In other words, unless every space was sealed with holy water, they were still within the ghosts' reach.

"Damn it! We need to escape! Staying here will get us surrounded!"

"Yes!"

Eisel hurriedly dispelled the holy water barrier and tried to open the door, but it wouldn't budge.

"Ugh, the ghosts are blocking the door from outside!"

"Those damn bastards!"

She kicked the door hard, but it didn't open. While Eisel and Fullame struggled with the door, Anella, who had been quietly crouching, turned her head at a sound from behind.

"...Huh?"

And then, she saw something strange. The skeleton models used for biology experiments and the anatomical models used for dissection practice began to move. The eyes of the anatomical model rolled and met Anella's gaze.

"Ah..."

For three seconds, her mind went blank. It wasn't because she was scared. It was because the rotten, dead fish eyes looking at her were so absurd.

"Even the models are ignoring me now... I'm over forty..."

Feeling both wronged and resentful, she clenched her fists. When a dark mage fully embraces their dark magic, they lose their magic but gain a significant boost in physical abilities. However, since she had lost all her unique traits and couldn't use magic, enhancing her physical abilities through dark magic was essential for combat.

"No one's watching anyway, right?"

Fullame already had some idea of her identity, and although she was concerned about Eisel, it was better than dying here without using her power.

"Remember, if you release more than 50% of your dark magic, you won't be able to hide it again."

Just before being dispatched, she received this warning from her superior while being branded by the Dark Magic Cult Leader. So, as long as she didn't exceed 50%, it should be fine, right?

Anella lightly clenched her fist and threw a jab. She had never learned or trained her body professionally, so this was her first attempt at hand-to-hand combat.

Boom!

The air shattered, and all the ghosts in front of her were instantly blown apart.

"What the...?!"

Fullame and Eisel, who were preparing magic to break the door, turned around in shock. Anella stood with her fist extended, and the lab wall was completely destroyed.

"What is this...?"

"What kind of magic was that...?"

The girls were astonished, but Anella couldn't answer. To be precise, she was also one of the astonished girls.

"What kind of power is this...?"

Even as a dark mage, she had never properly thrown a punch due to her fear, so she didn't know her own strength. With a bewildered expression, she spoke to the girls.

"Uh, the wall... is broken..."

"...Yes. Let's go that way."

Although the ghosts blocked the door from outside, thanks to Anella creating an easier path, the girls quickly escaped the lab.

"The rooftop! That's where that jerk is being held!"

"Yes!"

Fullame's party sprinted towards the stairs. Using the elevator in a ghost-filled place was suicidal. Although they had to climb dozens of floors, Anella's significant contribution to their strength made their progress much faster.

"Ahhh!"

A battle cry.

"Ughhh!"

Not a scream, but a battle cry. Anella, with her clumsy but powerful punches and kicks, cleared the way of ghosts, allowing the others to cast spells more freely and focus on defense, significantly speeding up their progress.

"We can make it at this rate!"

However.

"Huh...?"

Why didn't I think of this? The Seventh Tower is a ghost story itself. It can manipulate the entire building's space, so why wouldn't it affect the stairs?

"What is this..."

Anella looked ahead in despair. The main tower of Stella had a spiral staircase at the intersection of four corridors. Small warp holes or moving stairs were installed there, allowing students to conveniently travel between floors. But now, there was nothing. A huge hole was gaping in the ceiling and floor, with no trace of the stairs.

"This is..."

She hadn't anticipated this. She never imagined the building's structure would be so distorted.

"What should we do..."

Fullame desperately racked her brain. There must be a way. Some method she was missing. How did Eisel and Haewonryang overcome this obstacle in the original novel? There was no detailed description. It was just mentioned that Eisel was helped by Haewonryang.

"Wait, if it was Haewonryang's help...?"

Then, a sudden thought struck her. In the future, Haewonryang would become a 'Elemental Master' who could perfectly control all attributes. Although he currently only controlled wind, ice, and fire, he was already a master of those three attributes. In other words, Haewonryang could have used the high-level wind magic 'Wind Levitation.' Although it consumed a lot of mana, he could have used it to float up in such a crisis.

But there was no wind magic user here. In other words, there was no way to replace the stairs. She considered using Eisel's ice and her plant magic to climb, but it was impossible. The inherently weak durability of ice and plants wouldn't withstand the ghosts' attacks and would soon break. She could summon a large tree trunk and reinforce it with material manipulation to increase its strength, but could she reach that height while using two types of magic simultaneously?

"Ugh, the shadows are consuming the space!"

"I-It's hard!"

Her thoughts were interrupted. Eisel and Anella were being consumed by the shadows and slowly collapsing. Only one symbol remained.

"If the shadows consume you, you'll lose your sense of self."

With regretful eyes, she looked at the spot where the stairs used to be. If she poured all her mana into it, she might be able to climb. But doing so might mean losing Eisel and Anella.

"...It's my fault."

It was a hasty decision. I should have thought and judged more carefully. Even Baek Yuseol said the Seventh Tower's dark magic invasion was dangerous and needed preparation... Did I underestimate it too much?

"I'm an idiot and a fool."

Biting her lip so hard it bled, Fullame ran towards Eisel and Anella. There's no choice. Even if I use all my mana, I have to hold on.

"I can do it."

Eisel is the protagonist. The one and only protagonist of this world. Even if I fall here, I must protect her. Closing her eyes tightly, she chanted a spell. Unlike other magic, the incantation for light magic had a specific tone, sounding almost like a song.

...Saaa!

A golden light spread from Fullame. The darkness was devoured by the light, and the ghosts melted away. The intense and sacred light caused Anella and Eisel to step back and sit down.

"What is this..."

It was a type of magic they had never seen before. It wasn't destructive or blinding, but it purified all the darkness in the space. In an instant, the blackness receded, and light filled the world. Anella couldn't help but think.

"It's beautiful..."

As a dark mage, she was disqualified. To think that a magic opposite to hers was beautiful. But any dark mage would think the same. Even if they died from it, they would ultimately think it was beautiful. The golden magic circle at her feet spun, sending starlight into the sky. Indeed, the girl's magic resembled starlight. It wasn't light magic or holy magic, but starlight magic. Hearing the hymn of stars, Fullame slowly closed her eyes.

"...Still, I did my part."

I may only be able to hold on, but Eisel, as the protagonist, will find a way to overcome this obstacle. That's enough. As long as I can save Hong Biyeon and Eisel, it doesn't matter what happens to me now...

At that moment, a golden wave covered the golden light. It was another golden magic.

"Huh...?"

Anella, startled, closed her eyes tightly at the wave of magic, then noticed something strange and looked at the spot where the stairs should have been. There, a staircase appeared. An unnecessarily ornate, golden staircase, as if decorated for a king, extended to the top.

"This is..."

"Hurry!"

Anella, surprised, tried to say something, but Eisel acted immediately. Supporting the exhausted Fullame, she began to climb the stairs, and Anella quickly followed. Then, she glanced back.

...In the distance. In the darkness that Fullame hadn't erased, she thought she saw a golden boy, but he soon disappeared into the shadows. As if it were an illusion.
