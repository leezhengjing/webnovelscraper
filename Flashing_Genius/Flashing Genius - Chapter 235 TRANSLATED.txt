### Chapter 49: The Witch (2)

Recently, Hong Biyeon had been spending a lot more time alone. This was quite unusual for her, as she would always gather her faction members to show off her power whenever she had the chance. Of course, she didn't completely stop having gatherings. About two or three times a week, she would enjoy tea time with the noble girls in her faction, to keep up with the happenings in the school and the trends in the social circles.

"…Bitter."

Hong Biyeon, who was drinking black tea, was surprised to hear herself say that. 'Is it bitter…?' She wasn't sure. Anyway, it was an unpleasant sensation that made her tongue feel prickly.

"I'm sorry, Princess. I must have messed up the tea today…"

As Hong Biyeon frowned, the girl who had prepared the tea became frightened.

"It doesn't matter. Black tea is supposed to be bitter."

Although she didn't know much about the taste, it wasn't hard to give a response. The girl was relieved by Hong Biyeon's indifferent answer, and the other girls opened their mouths to change the subject.

"By the way, Princess, what do you think about the Witch's Restaurant?"

"The Witch's Restaurant?"

"Yes. It's a mysterious restaurant that suddenly appears and disappears all over the city of Arcanium."

"That's right. There are many stories in our class about people who have been there. Aren't you curious?"

"Hmm…"

Hong Biyeon swirled her tea. Her red eyes reflected in the teacup seemed even redder.

"Not really. I'm not interested in such rumors."

Although she didn't show much interest, the girls seemed to find the topic of the Witch's Restaurant very intriguing and continued to chat among themselves. As Hong Biyeon quietly stared at her tea, she sensed someone approaching from behind and turned her head.

It was Yeterin, Hong Biyeon's personal bodyguard. She handed over a yellow envelope.

"Princess, I found the documents you asked for."

"…Really?"

A few days ago, Eizel had come to her and asked about the Morfran Forest. At the time, she had brushed it off as if she wasn't interested, but since Eizel had come to ask personally, there must be a reason. She didn't plan to invest much time, but she thought she might as well satisfy her curiosity briefly.

However, the documents in the yellow envelope were mostly blank. There was only one large stamp on it.

[Top Secret]

Hong Biyeon frowned.

"Yeterin, what is this?"

"Since it's a high-level confidential matter, it was impossible to bring the documents outside the palace. However, as the current princess, you can return to the palace and view them anytime."

"Of course."

Unless it was a secret document that only the queen could see, there was no information that Hong Biyeon couldn't access. But even so, this was a bit suspicious.

'Morfran Forest…'

It was the core location of the incident where Grand Duke Isaac Morfran went berserk after being blackened, and Princess Hong Shihwa stopped him. It was a heroic tale that made Hong Shihwa's name known, so almost everyone knew about it. But why were the records of Morfran Forest so thoroughly hidden? Was there a reason?

"Good job."

As she flicked her fingers, the documents in the air burst into flames and disappeared without leaving any ashes.

'…I need to find out more about this.'

A smile formed on Hong Biyeon's lips. A confidential document that seemed to be hiding something intentionally. It was obvious. Someone was desperately trying to hide their disgrace. And that person was most likely… Princess Hong Shihwa. If she could uncover her weakness, she was willing to invest as much time as needed.

Returning to the Stella cadet dormitory, Eizel recalled the strange events at the Witch's Restaurant. What was that woman with the odd atmosphere trying to say? It was quite suspicious…

Could she be a dark mage? While that possibility couldn't be ruled out, the idea of a dark mage running a restaurant seemed a bit ridiculous. Moreover, with rumors about the Witch's Restaurant spreading all over Arcanium, a dark mage who wanted to live wouldn't stay there.

"I don't know."

Even after thinking deeply while taking a hot shower, Eizel couldn't figure it out. But there were too many unsettling points to just ignore it.

'Should I just ignore it?'

The more she thought about it, the longer her shower lasted. After 30 minutes of standing under the warm water, her head felt hot.

"Phew…"

After finishing her shower, Eizel cleaned up neatly, changed into her pajamas, and sat quietly on her bed. Then, she noticed an item she had tucked away in the corner of her dormitory. It looked like an ordinary broom. However, it was something she had found in the 'Witch's Hut' at the Stella Dome practice field, and it felt too peculiar to be just a teaching aid, so she had brought it back to the dormitory.

But when she asked her professors, they all shook their heads, saying they didn't feel any unusual magic from it. Since the professors were undoubtedly more skilled magicians, their words had to be right.

"What on earth is this…"

No matter how much she examined the broom, she couldn't figure out anything. Other than the strange and unpleasant magic it exuded, there was nothing noteworthy about it. She probably wouldn't be able to find out anything even if she kept it forever. Maybe she should take it outside and ask an expert. Although it would cost a bit for the appraisal, it would definitely satisfy her curiosity.

'Should I go right away since I thought of it?'

It wasn't too late yet, according to the clock. If she went out now and took the broom to a magic tool shop in Arcanium, she would have enough time to return before 10 PM. Having made up her mind, Eizel quickly changed her clothes and prepared to go out. Just as she was about to leave the dormitory, a thought crossed her mind.

'Why not ask Baek Yuseol instead?'

Come to think of it, was it necessary to go out and get an appraisal? Baek Yuseol, who knew everything, was right nearby. Even if he didn't know, there was no harm in asking. With that thought, Eizel turned her steps towards the boys' dormitory instead of the exit.

It was her first time visiting the boys' area, so she felt strangely nervous. However, there seemed to be almost no sign of life, as all the S-Class boys were out. She knocked on Baek Yuseol's dormitory door.

"Who is it?"

"It's me. I have something to ask."

Since it was her first time visiting someone else's dormitory, especially a boy's, her voice trembled slightly. Did Baek Yuseol notice? The door clicked open, and Baek Yuseol looked at Eizel with a surprised expression.

"What's up?"

"Um… I have something to ask."

"Come in."

"Really? Is that okay?"

"Why not? Come in quickly."

As Baek Yuseol gestured with his chin, Eizel calmed her pounding heart and stepped inside the dormitory. The interior was more ordinary than she had expected. While other S-Class girls decorated their dormitories to express their individuality, were all boys like this? Or was Baek Yuseol just too lazy to decorate? Whatever the case, she learned that he didn't particularly like interior decoration.

"You have a lot of snacks…"

"Yeah. They were gifts. That one is from Fullaim. Want some?"

"No, thank you."

Eizel was startled by his offer. Was it natural for teenagers these days to give and receive such things? Come to think of it, she had received a lot of help from Baek Yuseol but had never given him anything in return. Had she been too one-sided in receiving? Should she prepare a gift? If so, what should it be? Judging by the pile of snacks, did he like treats? But giving snacks as a thank-you gift seemed a bit…

"Why are you spacing out?"

"Huh? Oh, I was just thinking…"

"Anyway, what do you need?"

"Ah, could you take a look at this…"

Eizel carefully took the broom out of her bag and showed it to him. Baek Yuseol's eyes widened, and he put on his glasses.

"Hmm… You found this in the practice field, right?"

"How did you know?"

"I just had a feeling."

Baek Yuseol had a complicated expression. 'The Witch's Broom…' Come to think of it, there had been rumors about the Witch's Restaurant spreading throughout Stella recently. He hadn't paid much attention since it seemed like a passing rumor, but now that Eizel had found the broom, he couldn't ignore it anymore.

'Is the episode progressing simultaneously this time too…'

The story was common and predictable. Eizel, who accidentally got hold of the Witch's Broom, would be mistaken for a witch. In the worst-case scenario, a witch hunter might come to attack her…

"Have you met anyone suspicious recently?"

"Um… not really. What is this thing?"

"It's nothing. Just a broom."

Despite his words, Baek Yuseol took the broom from Eizel.

"This is confiscated."

"What?"

"I like the design. I'll hang it on the wall and admire it."

"Is that… your taste?"

"It should come with a matching dustpan, but you don't have that, do you?"

"No…"

"Anyway, this is mine now, so go to bed."

"That's too much."

"What's too much? Should I buy you a new broom?"

"No, that's okay."

Eizel pouted. She hadn't expected the broom to be confiscated when she came to get it examined.

"I'm leaving now."

"Take this with you."

When Baek Yuseol handed her a 'gum that looked like pizza-flavored candy,' Eizel quickly took it and dashed out of the dormitory. The door clicked shut, and she let out a deep sigh. She hadn't come to have such a one-sided conversation. Moreover, it was a rare chance to be alone with him, but she had just left after stupidly responding.

'…Why did he take the broom?'

Was it really his taste to decorate with such an old broom? Since she didn't know anything about the broom, her curiosity only grew.

'It's probably… nothing.'

The next day, while having lunch with Fullaim, she casually brought up the previous night's events.

"By the way, do you think Baek Yuseol has a hobby of collecting brooms?"

"Huh? What nonsense is that?"

Fullaim looked at her with a strange expression, as if she had heard something absurd.

"I've been getting a lot of help from him lately. So I wanted to give him a gift, but I have no idea what he likes."

"Really? Hmm… What does that guy like… But why a broom?"

"Oh, I found a strange broom in the practice field recently. It felt suspicious, so I asked him to check it out… but he just took it, saying he liked it."

"…What? A broom?"

This time, Fullaim's reaction was more intense. Her spoon, which had been moving non-stop, came to a halt as she asked Eizel again.

"Are you sure? You found a broom?"

"Yes, that's right."

"And he took it?"

Nodding, Eizel shook her head up and down as if it was no big deal. Fullaim let out a deep sigh and said,

"That's the Witch's Broom."

"…What?"

The word came out of nowhere. Although Eizel knew the term, she couldn't process it.

"The Witch's Broom. You know, the one witches use."

"Oh… Haha, that's a lame joke…"

A witch? Why would a witch suddenly appear? Moreover, Fullaim liked jokes, so it seemed plausible that she would say something like that. But contrary to Eizel's rationalization, Fullaim's expression was serious.

"It's really the Witch's Broom. And as you know, if you keep a witch's item for too long, it will absorb the witch's scent. It won't be good for you. A witch hunter might come after you. That's the worst-case scenario."

"…No way."

Eizel had heard of witch hunters. They were people who gave up everything to hunt witches. They would stop at nothing to hunt witches, making them as dangerous, if not more so, than witches. The magical world had given up on dealing with witch hunters. If there were more of them, the magical world might have been shaken to its core.

"Wait a minute. If that's true… why did Baek Yuseol take the Witch's Broom?"

"To protect you, of course. No matter how peculiar he is, there's no one crazy enough to decorate with a broom."

"That's true… But if that's the reason, then…"

"…Won't a witch hunter come after Baek Yuseol?"

Fullaim's hand, which had started moving again, stopped. Witch hunters were dangerous. More so than any other being. Could Baek Yuseol handle such a threat? With doubts and worries, they couldn't finish their meal properly.
