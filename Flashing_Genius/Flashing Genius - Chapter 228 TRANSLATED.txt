# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 228: The Start of the Semester (2)

The exterior of the Alchemy Castle evoked the grandeur of a medieval fortress, but its interior was designed with a modern touch. The hallways, painted a pristine white, were laid out in a precise cross shape, making it easy for newcomers to navigate. Each floor and corridor had clear signposts.

"Alright, let's make the Alchemy Castle even cleaner today!"

"Yay..."

Lakan was a janitor at the Alchemy Castle. He was just an ordinary young man in his twenties, working as a temporary janitor, burdened by the overzealous enthusiasm of his supervisor, who took immense pride in their job.

"Lakan! Let's work hard today! You can't be so unmotivated!"

"Sure..."

Having no other job prospects and lacking any particular skills, Lakan became a janitor. His timid nature made it difficult for him to socialize, and the only person who looked out for him was his supervisor.

"Alright, everyone to your designated areas!"

With a clap of his hands, the supervisor sent the janitors off with their cleaning carts. Lakan, with his messy hair and hunched back, tried to avoid attention but almost fell when someone bumped his shoulder.

"Ah!"

"Watch where you're going."

"Can he even see where he's going with that hair?"

"Who knows. Just ignore him."

Due to his timid nature and lack of cleaning skills, Lakan was often bullied by the other janitors. The supervisor, though aware, couldn't intervene in personal relationships. He could only hope that the janitors would work together harmoniously.

"Be careful not to upset the alchemists, and let's meet back here at the end of our shift."

The cleaning was done before the alchemists arrived, and then the janitors would gather to rest before their shift ended. Lakan followed the other janitors, using a vacuum cleaner powered by magitech. The primitive method of mopping the floor with a bucket and rag was not used in this advanced scientific civilization.

Although cleaning had become easier, it was still tiring. As Lakan was cleaning a section of the hallway, he noticed the other janitors slacking off in a corner.

'...Better avoid them.'

There was no benefit in getting noticed by them. They were bullies to their fellow janitors but cowered before the alchemists. Lakan found them repulsive but had no choice but to avoid them due to his lack of power.

"Hey, isn't that Lakan?"

"Come here for a second."

Cursing inwardly, Lakan cautiously turned his gaze towards them.

"I'm cleaning here..."

"That's why we called you. Help us clean our area too."

"But that's your area... I need to finish mine..."

The janitors put their arms around Lakan's shoulders, grinning.

"Come on. We'll help you next time. Just do it this once, and you can rest later."

"Still..."

"You're going to help, right? Thanks."

"See, Lakan is so kind."

The janitors dumped their cleaning tools on Lakan and disappeared. Left alone, Lakan sighed deeply and started pushing the vacuum cleaner. The advanced cleaner, which was silent and could mop the floor, felt particularly burdensome today.

Suddenly, a thought crossed his mind.

'...If I cast a Wind Secure spell on this, it would be more efficient.'

Why did the magitech engineer who developed this device choose such an inefficient method? He didn't know, but he assumed there must be a reason since the developer was smarter than him. However, this wasn't the only thing that puzzled him.

Everything related to alchemy was perfect, thanks to the genius scholar Alterisha. But magitech was different. The magitech in the Alchemy Castle was so poorly designed that Lakan couldn't understand why it was done that way.

'...Who am I to judge?'

Maybe he was getting arrogant after secretly reading a few magitech books. They say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. He only had a basic understanding, so he could only see what was in front of him.

However, he couldn't stand it any longer. Lakan stared at the experiment results posted in the hallway. Previously, he had modified the results of an experiment conducted by the alchemists because he was dissatisfied with it, and then quickly fled, fearing he had ruined it. This time, it was even worse.

Why on earth...

The experiment results were filled with sloppy numbers and alchemical arrays. How could the alchemists not notice this? Maybe they overlooked it?

Quickly scanning his surroundings, Lakan took out a cheap pen from his pocket and approached the experiment results. He smoothly adjusted the alchemical arrays and some of the enchantment spells, then swiftly put the pen away and fled.

'Oh no... I did it again...'

There must have been a reason for the seemingly sloppy alchemical arrays, but he had changed them on a whim. If he got caught, it would be a big problem. Despite knowing this, he couldn't suppress his burning desire to correct the mistakes he saw.

'But if I run away quickly, no one will know!'

He thought so, but he didn't know that there was a CCTV camera monitoring the exact spot where the results were posted.

---

That evening, Lakan ended up cleaning the areas assigned to his colleagues and couldn't clean his own area.

"Lakan, I know you're diligent despite being a bit timid, but this is becoming a problem."

Even the supervisor, who usually had a good opinion of him, seemed a bit angry. In reality, Lakan had been cleaning an area meant for three people by himself, which is why he couldn't clean his own area. But the supervisor didn't know that.

"You guys too. We have a mission to keep the Alchemy Castle spotless. Where do you think the technological advancements of the Aether Continent come from? Right here, this place!"

The three janitors who had dumped their work on Lakan also got scolded by the supervisor. Since Lakan couldn't clean three people's worth of area by himself, and he had spent a lot of time solving the problem, the cleaning wasn't done properly. The three janitors looked sullen and hung their heads.

"Yes..."

"Sorry."

Their apologies lacked sincerity, but the supervisor sighed, knowing they were always like this. Pretending to be angry, the supervisor patted Lakan's shoulder to comfort him.

"I know you're not the type to skip cleaning without a reason. If you have any concerns, come to me later."

The supervisor glanced at the three janitors. He had a hunch about what had happened but couldn't intervene. 

"See you in the evening."

As the supervisor left the janitors' break room, the three janitors glared at Lakan with cold eyes.

"Hey, can't you do your job properly?"

"Because of you, we got scolded."

"I don't even like that old man, and now we wasted our break time."

The three janitors started threatening Lakan, but the other janitors either avoided eye contact or snickered, not offering any help. Lakan didn't expect any help, but he felt disheartened by his situation. He thought being a janitor would suit him since he liked cleanliness and organization, but his relationships with others were a mess.

"Hey, say something."

"You're so frustrating."

"Should we just..."

As the three janitors threatened him, Lakan's shoulders hunched even more. He felt embarrassed by the others' gazes and wished he could hide somewhere.

"That's it. Come with us."

Unable to bear it any longer, the three janitors tried to drag Lakan to a corner of the storage room. But they couldn't.

Suddenly, the door opened, and the supervisor, who had left earlier, returned.

"Ah, haha. Supervisor, what brings you here...?"

The supervisor usually didn't interfere in the janitors' break room. The three janitors awkwardly smiled and asked, but the supervisor, looking pale, didn't respond.

"Ah...!"

Then, as if coming to his senses, the supervisor quickly stepped aside. 

Click!

A woman in a white gown appeared from behind the supervisor. The janitors gasped in shock. She was so beautiful and radiant that she seemed out of place in the dreary alchemy lab. She was none other than Alterisha, the head of the Alterisha School and the first alchemic magitech engineer.

"Uh, uh...?"

She looked at Lakan and tilted her head before turning around. A boy in a Stella Academy uniform was waiting behind her.

"Is that him?"

"Yes, it's him."

The boy approached Lakan, scrutinized him from head to toe, and nodded.

"He looks perfect for a researcher."

"...What?"

Was that a compliment or an insult? Lakan glanced at the boy's name tag on his uniform and his mouth fell open.

"Baek Yuseol!"

He was a teenager with absolute power within the Alchemy Castle, rarely seen but highly influential.

"Why, why is he here...?"

Baek Yuseol looked at Lakan and took out a piece of paper from his pocket. It was the experiment results Lakan had secretly modified earlier.

"Uh, uh, uh?"

Lakan, too flustered to speak, stammered as Baek Yuseol smiled.

"Did you solve this?"

"Th-that, I didn't mean to mess it up..."

The janitors, who had been shaking their heads, now looked at Lakan in disbelief. They had known he secretly read magitech books, but to tamper with the alchemists' experiment results? Lakan's mind went blank as he heard snickers around him. He needed to explain, but he couldn't think of anything.

"Th-that..."

As Lakan stammered, Baek Yuseol tilted his head and spoke.

"I think there's a misunderstanding. We're not here to scold you. We're here to praise you."

"...What?"

What was he talking about? Lakan, as well as the other janitors, looked bewildered, but Baek Yuseol continued.

"Despite your lack of basic knowledge, you came up with such an idea. You definitely have potential, Lakan."

"Y-yes..."

"Would you like to work as an official alchemic magitech engineer at the Alchemy Castle?"

"...What."

Did he hear that right? His mind went blank, and he couldn't respond. Then, he heard the other janitors gasp, and he snapped back to reality.

'Me, an alchemic magitech engineer?'

An alchemic magitech engineer was a top-tier technician who specialized in both alchemy and magitech. For a mere janitor to become one was the ultimate social ascent, akin to a commoner becoming a noble.

Lakan glanced around. The three janitors were sweating and avoiding eye contact. The other janitors, who had always ignored him, were the same. He hadn't intended to look around, but the thought of those who had belittled him now fearing him gave him a sudden boost of confidence.

"Y-yes... I'll do anything you ask."

"It's not about doing anything."

The person who spoke was not Baek Yuseol but Alterisha. She smiled warmly like an angel and took his hand, placing a stack of thick textbooks on it.

Thud!

"Ugh!"

The weight was enough to dislocate his shoulder. How did she carry this with her delicate frame? Before he could resolve his curiosity, Alterisha smiled brightly and said,

"From today, study hard!"

"...Yes?"

All of this? He wanted to ask, but the unknown pressure made him keep his mouth shut.

"Good luck!"

Alterisha's beautiful smile felt terrifying for some reason. He didn't know why.
