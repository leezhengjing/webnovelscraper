I Became a Genius in Front of the Magic School 231

48. The Start of the Semester⑸

Among the most famous last words of a man before he dies, there is this one: "I won't die." That's right. It was exactly what I had carelessly uttered just before engraving a subspace pocket, or inventory, onto my soul. In the end, I didn't die as the words suggested. However... it was painful enough to make me wish I had.

"Ugh..."

As Eltman removed his hand from my back, a strange gray magic circle swirled and disappeared, leaving a peculiar sensation in my chest.

* Rank: Transcendent
* Description: Can utilize the fourth dimension
▼ Special Effects
* Subspace Summoning: Can store items up to 120kg in weight and 12m³ in volume.
* Keyword Registration: Register specific actions or words to summon the subspace more easily and quickly.

Finally, I had obtained the inventory. Thinking about how much more convenient and comfortable my life would be from now on, tears welled up in my eyes. Or maybe it was because of the pain in my chest that felt like an elephant was sitting on it.

"Ugh..."

"It must hurt a lot, but it will soon subside. I'll allow you to skip tomorrow's class, but if you fall behind in the early part of the semester, it will be your loss. Are you okay with that?"

Nod, nod, nod. I nodded vigorously while lying on the bed. Pain is pain, but no student would refuse the principal's offer to skip class. As I struggled to get up, Eltman reached out to help me. However, I politely declined, not wanting to burden the principal, who must be exhausted from engraving the subspace.

"Baek Yuseol."

"...Yes."

As I barely managed to sit on the bed, Eltman wiped his cold sweat with a handkerchief and spoke.

"If you were an ordinary student, you would have died."

I knew that. This wasn't physical pain but a direct hit to the soul. No matter how high one's endurance or how many mana shields one had, an ordinary wizard might have died or suffered a mental disorder.

"It was a pain that even a 7th-class wizard would find hard to endure. I also engraved it when I had just reached the 8th class in my youth, so I understand the pain well. But you..."

Eltman narrowed his eyes.

"Despite the severe aftereffects, you have the mental strength to get up on your own."

"...Well, yes."

As I was pondering how to explain this, he spoke first.

"I know. You are not an ordinary student. Perhaps, you are more special than anyone among us."

"Excuse me? I don't think that's quite right... No matter what, I can't be better than a 9th-class wizard. Even if I spent my entire life, even if I lived for a thousand years, I couldn't reach the level of a 9th-class wizard. That realm is truly for 'geniuses,' and no matter how long an ordinary person lives, they can't reach it."

"That's not what I mean. In this world, even a 9th-class wizard, a sage who has realized the truth, an alchemist who has achieved immortality, or even the Twelve Zodiac are not special. They are all just cogs in the wheel of fate."

The wheel of fate? I had never heard such a term before. It wasn't even in the direct translation glasses, so I could infer that Eltman Eltewin had coined the term on the spot... but it felt different.

The strange sense of alienation from that word kept making my chest feel stuffy.

"You are different. You can walk a different path from us."

What could the 'different path' that a 9th-class wizard spoke of mean? Eltman Eltewin was a very special person by my standards. In one episode of the original game, he had the skill to confront the Dark Mage King, who could be considered the strongest in the world.

So, when such a person tells me that I am 'special'... should I take it positively?

"Baek Yuseol. I want to ask you one thing."

"Go ahead."

With a serious look in his eyes, he met my gaze and carefully opened his lips.

"If, by any chance, the world were to end..."

However, he soon closed his mouth and shook his head.

"No, never mind. I'll ask you later. Your condition isn't normal right now, is it?"

After saying that, he smiled bitterly, which felt so awkward that even I, who was perfect at managing my expressions thanks to the blessing of Yeonhongchunsamwol, ended up with an awkward smile.

"I'll hear it later."

"You're probably tired, so be careful on your way back. Don't worry about your classes; I'll inform them in advance, so rest well."

"Yes..."

With Eltman's concern, I struggled to get up and left the principal's office.

Click!

As the door to the principal's office closed, the tension released, and my stiff muscles began to scream.

"Ugh..."

It hurts. As if I were dying. Clutching my chest, I trudged towards the dormitory. Since I could legally skip classes tomorrow, I thought I might as well go back and sleep...

It's quite common for one or two students to leave early due to illness at the magic school. Since magic warrior cadets gain practical experience and conduct various exercises, it's not uncommon for them to get seriously injured or fall ill.

Therefore, when someone gets hurt and misses class, it's usually just accepted as normal. However, the news that the famous boy Baek Yuseol had missed three whole days of classes at the beginning of the semester raised suspicions among the other students.

After all, it had been less than a week since the second semester started, and they were still only conducting orientation without any proper exercises.

"What happened?"

"I heard he got food poisoning from eating sashimi at the summer beach."

"That's why you shouldn't eat sashimi in the summer."

"What are you talking about? I heard it was just a cold."

Since no one knew the exact reason, rumors spread and became exaggerated, leading to various stories. Because Baek Yuseol had achieved so many accomplishments as a first-year cadet, most students believed the baseless rumor that he had been injured while secretly hunting dark mages.

"Is he really sick?"

Thump! Thump! The sound of a basketball bouncing. Squeak! The sound of shoes sliding. In the indoor gym, Fullaim, who was playing a basketball game in casual sportswear, heard the news from his male friends.

"What's going on?"

"He's your ex-boyfriend. Aren't you curious?"

"What are you talking about?"

Fullaim snorted and lightly threw the basketball. Clang! A clean shot, and it went in.

"Wow, as expected of Fullaim!"

"Shut up, don't make a fuss."

"If you're jealous, do better than me."

"I’m better than you at soccer, billiards, baseball, tennis, and table tennis. Can't I just let you have basketball?"

"...Damn it."

Teasing his friend, Fullaim returned to the bench and wiped his sweat with a towel. Too lazy to put the towel back, he draped it around his neck and gulped down an ion drink. Then, he sensed someone approaching.

"...Hello."

"Huh? What, it's Angel. Don't you dislike sports?"

Angel, with her blue hair tied back tightly, was also wearing sportswear like Fullaim. Although she consistently did basic physical training, she didn't particularly like sports, so her outfit felt quite out of place.

"Just... I thought I'd roll a ball around for a change of pace."

"Sure. You'll do well."

With Angel's all-rounder trait, she could reach a decent level with just a little practice. Though she wouldn't come close to Mayuseong, who had the legendary whirlwind shot trait.

"You look like you have a lot on your mind. I think I know why."

Baek Yuseol is sick. Just that fact would make many people feel uneasy. And honestly, Fullaim was also constantly worried about him, trying not to think about it.

Because it felt like losing if he worried first.

"I heard he still comes out to eat, so it shouldn't be a fatal illness."

There were reports from here and there that Baek Yuseol, looking like a shut-in with a hat pulled down, came out to eat during lunch or dinner. So, it might just be a minor ailment.

"That's true, but..."

Angel's concern wasn't just because Baek Yuseol was sick.

"Why is he sick...?"

"Huh?"

It was a question he hadn't thought to consider, so it caught him off guard.

"Well, do we need to know that?"

"...I guess not."

Thinking about it more, it did seem strange. Baek Yuseol, who seemed tougher than steel and had never caught a cold in his life, was suddenly living like a shut-in for three days. Moreover, Eltman Eltewin had personally allowed his absence, so there must be a reason...

"He won't die from that."

Fullaim said confidently. The Baek Yuseol he knew had the survival skills of a cockroach, even reversing time and returning from dimensional rifts. He couldn't imagine him dying from a mere illness.

"If you're really worried, go see him yourself."

"I did visit... but he said he was fine."

"Then he's fine."

Having rested enough, Fullaim got up and said.

"In my opinion, he'll soon get up and walk around as usual."

"Do you think so?"

Relieved by Fullaim's words, Angel smiled and nodded.

"Yeah. So don't worry and focus on what you need to do."

And that night, late at night.

"...Sigh."

Unable to stop worrying, Fullaim got up in the middle of the night and secretly went to the boys' dormitory.

The school didn't completely prohibit boys and girls from visiting each other's dorms, but if a girl was caught in the boys' dorm at this hour, it wouldn't just end with demerit points. It was a risky act, almost like risking her life.

"My fate..."

Fortunately, Baek Yuseol lived in the S-class dormitory, where there were very few people, so it was unlikely to run into other students at this late hour. She just needed to quietly meet Baek Yuseol and leave. That's what she thought.

"...Fullaim?"

"Ugh."

Until she ran into 1st-year S-class student Pung Harang, who happened to be out for a walk at night.

"Hey, you scared me... Why are you wandering around at this hour?"

"...I think that's my line. This is the boys' dormitory. Do you have any business here?"

"Uh, yeah. I do."

Feeling embarrassed to say she came to see Baek Yuseol, she tried to hide it, but then felt even more embarrassed and confused, so she blurted it out.

"I came to see Baek Yuseol."

"...Really?"

"Sigh, I heard he's sick. He didn't even come out for meals today. I thought I'd bring him some porridge."

"That... doesn't seem necessary."

Pung Harang pointed to the front of Baek Yuseol's dormitory. There were small boxes and envelopes, indicating that some students had brought food for him.

"Do you think that's the same? What's important is sincerity. I made this myself, and there's no way Baek Yuseol would refuse it."

After saying that confidently, Fullaim headed towards Baek Yuseol's dormitory and knocked quietly.

"Hey, open up. It's your sister."

The door didn't open. Pung Harang hesitated and said.

"It won't open. He hasn't opened it for anyone..."

But before he could finish, the door opened from the inside, and a haggard-looking Baek Yuseol peeked out. Seizing the opportunity, Fullaim pushed the door open and slipped inside.

Click!

After Fullaim disappeared, the S-class boys' dormitory hallway fell silent. Pung Harang, who had been staring at Baek Yuseol's dormitory with a complicated expression, put on his sports jacket and walked down the hallway. He had planned to take a refreshing walk under the moonlight, but it seemed like it would be a restless night.
