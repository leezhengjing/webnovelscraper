# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 253

## 50. Noble Soul (6)

Sa Yelan Orkan. As the eldest daughter of the Orkan Duke family, one of the two great families of the Adolevit Kingdom, she inherited the special magical tactics known as the "Magic Judicial Book" from the war hero Aslan Orkan. She was raised to be a master of magical warfare from a young age. It has already been three years since she entered Stella Academy as the heir to the Orkan family. She proudly stood at the top of her third-year class, excelling in both practical and theoretical studies with the highest grade of A+, and was eagerly awaiting her graduation day.

"Miss, Professor Magellan has contacted us to prepare the 'graduation album'."

In Sa Yelan's private club room, despite not being affiliated with any club, the professors had provided her with a grand office where she handled the Orkan family's affairs. She shook her head in annoyance at the student's words.

Most Stella students take their graduation album photos alone. However, in rare cases, outstanding students are given the honor of taking their graduation photos with a professor, which often comes with opportunities to co-author a thesis or secure a position as a researcher at the Magic Tower. Many students aspire to this.

Of course... In Sa Yelan's case, the situation was reversed, with professors often clinging to her. It was an ironic situation where the student had to acknowledge the professor to take the graduation photo together.

"Decline."

Sa Yelan spoke indifferently and lowered her gaze. She had already completed her university-level studies at the beginning of the semester and finished her graduation thesis long ago. Currently, she was handling a significant amount of family business while still attending school. Graduation album? Ridiculous. She had no intention of doing such a bothersome thing. The moment she graduated, she planned to sever all ties with Stella Academy and return to the Orkan family to focus on her main duties.

"Miss, the 'Purification Ceremony' is scheduled soon. Shall I apply for leave on your behalf?"

The Purification Ceremony. It was a joint ceremony held once a year by the Orkan family and the Adolevit royal family, ever since the Morfran Forest was contaminated by the dark magic of Grand Duke Isaac Morfran ten years ago. The ceremony, led by Princess Hong Si-hwa and involving the Orkan family's purification rituals, was attended by only a select few, with strict information control regarding all internal activities. It was so secretive that even the wizards participating in the ceremony were subjected to one of the forbidden spells, the "Prohibition Spell." Although it was widely known that the Prohibition Spell was used, revealing this to the public would result in severe criticism, indicating the high level of confidentiality of the Purification Ceremony.

Naturally, none of the students assisting Sa Yelan in her club room had heard anything about the Purification Ceremony. They only knew that it existed, that it was something the young lady was involved in, and that they had to assist her.

'Purification Ceremony...'

Sa Yelan put down her pen and fell into thought. This would be her first time participating in the Purification Ceremony as an adult, but she had already heard about its secrets from her father.

'The true story behind the incident in Morfran Forest.'

It was publicly known that the Morfran Forest was entirely contaminated by dark magic due to Grand Duke Isaac Morfran's dark magic rampage ten years ago, but that was a lie. In truth, the Adolevit family forcibly resurrected the "White Fox Spirit," and Grand Duke Isaac Morfran chose to become a dark mage to stop it... That was the truth.

Sa Yelan had no personal feelings about it. She had no sense of duty to eradicate dark mages to protect the magical world, nor a conviction to become a great mage. Her only goal, instilled in her, was to place Princess Hong Si-hwa on the throne. She had never harbored any personal sense of purpose.

However, after hearing this story, for some reason, Sa Yelan's mind became slightly confused.

'Why did Princess Hong Si-hwa have to do such a thing?'

She knew there was a hidden secret among the princesses of the Adolevit family, but she didn't understand the exact reason, so she couldn't comprehend the events of ten years ago at all. What could they possibly gain from the White Fox Spirit to go to such lengths? And... why did Grand Duke Morfran sacrifice himself?

'So many questions.'

As Sa Yelan wrote down her questions on a blank sheet of paper, a student approached her.

"Miss, you have a visitor."

"Send them away."

"Well... it's Princess Hong Bi-yeon."

No wonder the student's expression wasn't good; an uninvited guest had arrived. However, Sa Yelan nodded calmly and stood up. Although Princess Hong Bi-yeon was an adversary of the princess she served, she was still a royal princess and could not be ignored. Sa Yelan knew how to separate public and private matters and was skilled at hiding her personal feelings in official situations.

Click!

As the attendants opened the door, Sa Yelan stood in front of it to greet Princess Hong Bi-yeon. Unlike usual, she had come alone and immediately entered the club room, glancing around.

"It's modest."

"Thank you."

"That wasn't a compliment."

"I know."

"Sit."

Hong Bi-yeon said, sitting in what was clearly Sa Yelan's seat, crossing her legs. She leaned back on the sofa with her arms crossed, while Sa Yelan sat silently in front of her. Despite the obvious provocation, Sa Yelan remained unresponsive.

"Shall I bring some tea?"

"No need. I'll just say what I need to and leave. You're participating in the Purification Ceremony this time, right?"

"Yes."

"I'm going too. Just so you know."

"...That's not something I can decide."

Sa Yelan was troubled. Although her expression didn't change, Hong Bi-yeon could sense it.

"I know. But I'm going. There's no reason why a princess of Adolevit can't go, right?"

Sa Yelan quietly nodded. The reason Princess Hong Bi-yeon was telling her this was probably because her father was in charge of the Purification Ceremony. This year, Princess Hong Si-hwa had some urgent matters and couldn't attend, leaving a vacancy. It would be difficult to stop Hong Bi-yeon's interference.

'This is troublesome...'

Hong Bi-yeon was an adversary of Hong Si-hwa. Morfran Forest was undoubtedly Hong Si-hwa's weakness. Exposing it to Hong Bi-yeon would be like revealing a vulnerability.

'I have to stop her.'

But how? Hong Bi-yeon twisted her red lips. It was as if she was daring Sa Yelan to come up with an excuse.

'...She already knows everything.'

The queen wouldn't intervene in this matter. It was something Hong Bi-yeon and Hong Si-hwa had to resolve on their own. No matter how Hong Si-hwa tried to interfere, Hong Bi-yeon had no intention of backing down. And she planned to use the "Compass of Memory" there. It was an ancient artifact, with only seven remaining in the world, that allowed one to glimpse past events. However, due to its high usage cost, it was only used for important matters by the royal family. But Hong Bi-yeon had the right to use the Compass of Memory once a year, and she planned to use it this time.

'I need to find out what happened from beginning to end.'

Her red eyes cooled down.

* * *

In the world of Aether, there are World Trees that originated from the seeds of the primordial World Tree, the Celestial Tree. In the distant past, there were more than ten, but now only seven remain. The Celestial Tree's cradle is the home and root of the elves, and the only place where a king can reside. The other World Trees do not have kings living in them, so the elders live in modest wooden houses.

So, honestly, I was surprised. I had never visited an elf elder's house while playing the game, so I hadn't expected it to be so modest.

"Hoho, I apologize for inviting you to such a humble place..."

The elder's name was Suhaksan. He bowed his head in apology as he welcomed Ggot Seorin into his humble hut, but she shook her head.

"No, as an elf, I envy such a natural home."

Ggot Seorin seemed to genuinely mean it. Given her personality, she didn't seem to like unnecessarily flashy and extravagant things.

"Would you like to sit here?"

Although the wooden chair was hard and uncomfortable, it surprisingly felt comfortable. What was it? A luxury item pretending to be cheap? I glanced out the window. Although it was described as a humble hut, it was located at the highest point of the World Tree, with roots spread out so densely that it was impossible for anyone to intrude. Moreover, magical warriors were standing guard, giving off the feeling that this was indeed the residence of a very important person.

"So... can you tell me the exact story?"

At Ggot Seorin's words, Elder Suhaksan sighed and bowed his head deeply.

"The first discovery was ten days ago."

The Orchard of Tree Transformation, as its name suggests, bore fruit from the World Tree. Since the entire city was made of wood, one could pick and eat any kind of fruit from around the world at any time. But one day, the fruits stopped growing. To find out why, they sent some garden-keeping wizards to the roots of the World Tree, and what they found was shocking.

"The roots of the World Tree... were infested with dark magic."

"How could that be..."

"We tried everything we could to solve it. But it was no use."

Since spirits and elementals are particularly weak against dark magic, the elves had developed purification techniques to protect them. They used purification magic far superior to human techniques to remove the dark magic from the roots, but the problem was what happened next.

"The next day, we went to check for any remaining dark magic... but for some reason, the roots were infested again in just one day."

So they thought someone was coming every night to infuse dark magic. They deployed forces to catch the intruder, but...

"It was no use."

No matter how powerful the purification magic was, the next day, the World Tree would be infested with dark magic again. The elders, including Elder Suhaksan, witnessed this situation firsthand and were convinced.

"It's been ten days now. We thought there was no solution, but then Your Majesty visited, and we were finally able to feel at ease."

"Ah..."

Ggot Seorin looked perplexed. It seemed she misunderstood, thinking that she had come to solve the contamination of the World Tree, as she was the only high elf who could communicate directly with the Celestial Tree. But she had come without knowing anything. In the first place, no matter how powerful Ggot Seorin's abilities were, it was impossible to communicate with a World Tree from afar.

"I'll try talking to the World Tree."

"Hoho, it's reassuring to have Your Majesty's help."

Listening quietly to their conversation, I sighed. It was natural for Ggot Seorin to communicate with the World Tree, so I had no intention of stopping her, but it probably wouldn't help. The root cause wasn't there.

'This must be because of Yiphanell... I didn't expect this episode to come so soon, so I hadn't thought about it at all, but now I can't help but notice.'

An episode that was supposed to occur one to two years later, [The Black Spirit], had come to me, skipping several stages.
