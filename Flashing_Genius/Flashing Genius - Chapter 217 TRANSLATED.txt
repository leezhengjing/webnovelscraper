### Chapter 217: The Genius Who Teleported to the Magic School (13)

**Old Stories**

Aizel often recalled those memories from time to time. Her naive childhood. The day she defied the head maid after being scolded and ventured alone into the Morfran Forest, which her father had strictly forbidden.

"I remember. That day, I was being chased by a wolf monster. I thought I was surely going to die."

Aizel recounted her story to Flame as she followed the young Aizel and a boy named 'Baek Seolgi,' who was presumed to be Baek Yuseol. Flame listened intently, as it was a story she had never heard before.

"Then, he appeared. That man. I still don't know his name or face, but he was a hero in my memory. Even though it was a brief encounter, he saved me."

As she watched the young Aizel and Baek Seolgi wandering through the forest, she delved deeper into her memories.

"Probably after this, the knights..."

No sooner had Aizel spoken than knights in blue uniforms from Morfran appeared and surrounded Baek Seolgi. He handed the young Aizel over to the knights without resistance, but suspicion lingered. Morfran Forest was a place strictly off-limits to outsiders.

"Now that I think about it, it's strange. How did he get in here?"

"Well, it's Baek Yuseol. He must have found a way."

"That's true."

They couldn't fathom the ingenious method he might have used. Wondering about his approach was a waste of energy since they would never find out.

"Reveal your identity."

"Baek Seolgi."

"...That's the name of a rice cake."

"That's why I hate rice cakes."

Seeing Baek Seolgi give such an absurd answer to the serious knights' questions, Aizel and Flame were convinced.

"It's Baek Yuseol."

"Yes, it's Baek Yuseol. No one else would say something so ridiculous in such a serious situation."

"Damn it...!"

When the knights, enraged, tried to threaten Baek Seolgi, the young Aizel grabbed their sleeves and shouted, almost in tears. Could there be a knight in the Morfran family who could ignore the face of a cute, almost-crying young lady? However, one high-ranking knight couldn't abandon his duty despite the young lady's plea. It was urgent to find out how he had infiltrated Morfran Forest and uncover his identity to prevent such incidents from happening again.

"I'll tell my father!"

"Pfft."

"...Don't laugh."

"Mmph, I'm not laughing."

"...Seriously, don't laugh."

Aizel, in her translucent state, blushed as red as a carrot and hung her head low, while Flame turned her head to the side, trying hard to suppress her laughter. It was one thing to show such a side to Flame, but thinking that Baek Yuseol had seen it made her want to die of embarrassment.

"I took a wrong turn. If you show me the way out, I'll leave quickly."

Despite the young Aizel's tantrum, Baek Yuseol calmly said that. It was almost a relief.

"Wait a moment."

"Ah..."

A voice so familiar and dear to Aizel came from across the forest. The entire knight squad immediately turned around and knelt, and Flame looked at the man with a peculiar expression.

'Isaac Morfran,' the father of the original female protagonist in the story.

"A-ah..."

Aizel's face was already half-distorted, looking like she might cry at any moment. But she held back her tears and bit her lip.

"Hey, are you okay?"

"...Yes, I'm fine."

Even though she longed to see her father, she couldn't afford to waste her emotions here. She would hold back until she uncovered all the truths about what had happened.

---

Baek Yuseol, or rather Baek Seolgi, was invited to a meal by Isaac Morfran. However, for some reason, he didn't eat any of the luxurious food in front of him. The reason was probably...

"Because of the mask."

"He must have a reason he can't take it off."

They quietly watched the meal. Throughout the meal, the young Aizel pouted with food all over her mouth, and Aizel's expression constantly twisted. Fortunately, Baek Seolgi showed no reaction, but who knew what expression he was making behind that mask?

"Seeing my dark past is really painful enough to make me want to die."

"Really?"

Flame quietly watched the young Aizel and Isaac. Isaac cut the food with a fork and knife and fed it to the young Aizel, who pouted whenever peppers or vegetables were on it.

"Still, isn't it fortunate to see that?"

Countless thoughts swirled in her mind. Why hadn't she done better back then? Why hadn't she shown more love to her father? Why had she been so foolish as a child, always pouting at her father? If only she had been better to him back then. Why?

"No, it's painful. Very much."

"...Sorry."

Flame made a bitter expression. Having never had parents, she couldn't fully empathize with Aizel, who had lost hers. She regretted speaking, feeling she had touched Aizel's wound.

"I can't help but be curious about you. Could you tell me as much as you can?"

While the young Aizel quietly picked at her food, Isaac and Baek Seolgi continued their conversation.

"I'm just a wandering adventurer."

"An adventurer. A romantic profession."

"Thank you."

"My daughter told me you cut down a Sharp Wolf with a single stroke."

This question piqued Flame and Aizel's curiosity. The Sharp Wolf was a 5-risk monster powerful enough to destroy a small village alone, and he had subdued it barehanded. Naturally, Baek Yuseol didn't answer properly. They hadn't expected an easy answer, but it was still disappointing.

"Well, it would be strange if someone who beats 6 to 7-risk Black Demons got defeated by a 5-risk monster."

"That's true. Though I've never seen him fight directly, I always thought he was hiding something based on his usual behavior."

The conversation grew more complex and lengthy, and the young Aizel, having finished her meal, began to yawn, feeling sleepy. She wanted to tell her younger self not to leave and stay longer, but the young Aizel wouldn't understand.

"Princess, are you done with your meal?"

"Yes... I want to go to my room."

"Call the maid, Pesila."

Thus, the young Aizel left, and Aizel's 'memory' completely ended there. It was so long ago that she couldn't remember it properly.

"Now that my daughter is gone, I have a straightforward request."

Isaac Morfran lowered the atmosphere and looked at Baek Seolgi with a serious expression. He also listened attentively.

"First, I must say this."

After a short pause.

"I won't live long."

"...What?"

Thud, her heart sank. Of course, it was true that her father had passed away not long after, but she had never imagined he had known his time was short long before.

"What do you mean, Dad..."

Aizel asked with a desperate expression, but unfortunately, Isaac couldn't see her.

"Please understand that I can't explain the reason. But this request is sincere. I can't protect my daughter for long. Keeping her by my side might even harm her. When the time comes..."

Isaac looked straight into Baek Seolgi's eyes through his mask.

"Could you protect my daughter, even if just for a short while?"

"No, Dad, please..."

"Until she can stand on her own... No, even if she just stays alive..."

At this moment, Isaac looked more desperate than anyone else in the world.

"Please, protect my daughter."

Her father's last request. It was a curse to Aizel.

The night wind in the forest was cold. While Isaac, Hong Siwha, and the wizards were having a strategy meeting, I sneaked out of the tent and approached the place where the Black Demon's aura was emanating. I adjusted my mask to avoid being recognized. If I encountered the Black Demon I had met in the future, it would be a huge problem.

"This place..."

The Black Demons infiltrate human society, perfectly blending in by disguising their identities. So, I thought this Black Demon would also be disguised as a soldier or knight, but it wasn't. The place where the dark energy was felt was deep in the forest, far from any human-friendly terrain. As I pushed through the forest, I heard a cracking sound.

Crack!

'Ugh!'

A giant tree formed a fist with its branches and slammed it down where I was standing.

Boom!

I quickly jumped back, and this time, dozens of branches came at my feet from behind.

'Is it a Living Tree?'

A tree that moves and grows by absorbing the blood of animals, also known as 'Blood Tree' because it bleeds red like a human when cut. Living Trees usually live in groups, so finding one meant certain death, but for me, it was a different story.

[Teleport]

Thanks to the blessing of Silver November, I had an additional teleport, allowing me to move four times in a row. I flew high into the sky and landed on the tallest Living Tree. What to do next? Nothing. Just waiting quietly here meant they couldn't catch me. The strength of the Living Tree lies in its numerous branches that can entangle any creature, but its weakness is that it can't extend its branches higher than its own height. I used that to secure a safe spot without even fighting.

As I sat on the top of the still-moving Living Tree to catch my breath, a voice came from beside me.

"Impressive."

A deep, low voice. When I turned to check, there was a rather unexpected person.

'What...'

It was so unexpected that my mind went blank for a moment. A familiar face. Professor Raydin of Stella Academy, a Black Demon and an 8-class wizard, and a close aide to Archiheiden. He was loyal to the Black Demon Cult leader and acted solely for that person. In this world, he was one of the most devout individuals.

'Professor Raydin...'

He was sitting on the tree, looking far away at the human command tent.

"Did you come to find me?"

I nodded without saying a word. Even a single word could make him remember my voice, causing a serious timeline error and completely twisting the future.

"I have no intention of harming you."

I aimed my staff at him, thinking it would be troublesome if he found out. I took out my spare staff and pointed it at him. Fighting him would be difficult, and it would cause problems with the causality of time, but I made a threatening gesture.

"You're impatient. All human wizards are like you."

"I don't intend to fight you. Rather, I came to save you."

Raydin's demeanor was slightly different from the professor at Stella. I didn't know what it was. I shook my staff up and down, gesturing 'What do you mean?' and Raydin spoke. He didn't seem to want to fight me either.

"Wizards are once again bringing calamity to this world. You call us Black Demons and label us as evil, but it's the opposite. You have always threatened the world, and we have always saved it from the shadows."

After saying that, he stood up. I quickly turned my head to see the command tent, where people were dispersing, indicating the meeting was over. Using my binocular glasses to zoom in, I saw that Isaac Morfran and Princess Hong Siwha were still inside, talking. It didn't seem like a good conversation, making me anxious.

"I don't hate wizards."

"Because you all have the potential to be saved."

Raydin said that and then disappeared into the mist.

"...Typical cultist. Are you asking for a confession?"

Just hearing him talk about 'salvation' made it clear he wasn't in his right mind.

"Sigh..."

I put away my staff and looked up at the night sky. The sky was unusually dark, as if it was hiding the future.
