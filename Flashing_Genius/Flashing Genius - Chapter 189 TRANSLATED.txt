# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy

## Chapter 189: Everything is Frozen (2)

Night had fallen. The evening at the Levian coast was cold and desolate, but Hong Biyeon, who naturally liked cold weather, put on her coat and went out for a night walk. Every time the blade-like cold wind brushed past her cheeks, her distracting thoughts died away. Standing on the outer edge of the sharp castle wall, she gazed at the sea, which sparkled in the moonlight. It was a beautiful sight, so much so that she wondered if there could be a more beautiful landscape in the world. Hong Biyeon captured the scenery of the sea in her ruby-colored eyes. It felt as if the frozen sea would melt away just by looking at it.

"Your role is very simple." The words that Queen Heung Seryu had conveyed to her came to mind. "Embody the Fire Spirit Flower and resonate with the Heart of Eternal Ice. That is the only thing you can do for this country." The words were so easy to say. There was no need to elaborate. It was a command to go and die for the sake of the country, under the guise of a royal duty to protect the people. It was utterly ridiculous. Knowing full well the true intentions behind it, Hong Biyeon acted as if she had no choice but to comply.

Whoosh...! The blowing wind made her hair flutter. The freezing temperature made her ears and nose feel numb. "Oh my, sister~ What are you doing here at this hour~?" Coincidentally, she ran into Hong Siwha, who was 'coincidentally' passing by. Hong Biyeon looked at her silently. Hong Siwha's steps were as lively as a child's, as if she was having a great time. "Aren't you cold? What if you catch a cold~?" The royal family of Adolevit does not catch colds. Feeling it wasn't worth responding, Hong Biyeon turned her gaze away, but Hong Siwha thrust her face in that direction. "Are you ignoring your sister's advice~?" "Just go inside." "So cold~" Deciding it was too bothersome to stay any longer, Hong Biyeon started walking away. Her pleasant walk had been interrupted, and she thought it would be better to just sleep peacefully. "Sister." Suddenly, Hong Siwha lowered her voice and called out, making Hong Biyeon stop in her tracks. "......What is it?" "Why didn't you refuse~?" "That's a strange question." She would really die. All the life she had desperately worked for would collapse in an instant. Yes, if it were before she entered Stella, she might have refused. She couldn't let go of everything she had enjoyed and would continue to enjoy. Before that... she was too afraid of dying. But now, it was different. Hong Biyeon looked her straight in the eyes and said, "I'm different from you." Her gaze seemed to say that whatever plans or thoughts Hong Siwha had, they didn't matter to her. Hong Siwha tightly closed her lips. "It's cold, let's go back." Even as she watched her sister's slow but confident steps, Hong Siwha did not stop her. 'Hmm... she's grown a lot?' At that moment, she suddenly thought of Hong Erin, who had died long ago. "Ugh, useless thoughts again." Hong Siwha shook her head and walked away quickly. The choice had been made, and there was no stopping what was to come... From now on, everything would be left to fate. 'If she dies here, it was her fate from the beginning.' Hong Biyeon would die before she turned twenty. Just like her eldest sister. So even if she died now, it would only bring that fate forward by three years. Nothing would change.

Black Matale. A descendant of the legendary pirate king who once ruled all the seas of the world, and now the lord of the Heavenly Ice Palace, he had sworn loyalty to the Adolevit royal family. He had never once defied the queen. However, this time was different. "A disaster will come." Kneeling before the queen, Black Matale quietly murmured. His deep voice echoed throughout the grand audience hall. "......Is that all you have to say?" "Please believe me, Your Majesty. You must never touch the Black Cross ship." "Ha, are you afraid of the ghost sleeping on that pirate ship?" Matale's eyes filled with anger at the insult to his ancestors, but he quickly suppressed it. Fortunately, he bowed his head in time to hide it. "He... was once the man who ruled the seas. If the founding wizard and his twelve disciples ruled the land, then the pirate king Black Belize ruled the seas. Do not disturb his ghost." "That was a thousand years ago. In the past hundred years, we have sent seven expeditions, but the ghost did not budge." "He is merely sleeping for a while. The ghost of the pirate king is trapped in an eternal curse and will never disappear!" Bang! When Matale shouted, the queen stomped her foot hard. Pillars of flame erupted in the air, filling the palace. "How dare you raise your voice in the presence of the queen." "Do you not understand why I am trying so hard to stop you? Our family swore loyalty to the Adolevit royal family because you promised to return the sea of Levian to us someday. This is... a violation of that promise!" "So?" The queen spoke in a soft voice. "What difference does it make if someone like you defies me?" Matale swallowed his anger and bowed his head. She was right. The queen was an 8th-class wizard, and her guards were composed of wizards of at least 6th to 7th class. It was an absurdly powerful force, befitting a superpower. In contrast, Black Matale, who had lost the sea, had no power to oppose the Adolevit royal family. Even if he broke the promise now... there was no way to stop it. "Our ancestors... and the ghost of the pirate king will be enraged." Despite his words, the queen did not listen. Black Matale closed his eyes tightly and accepted his despair. 'If you anger his soul, a disaster will come.' A story his grandfather used to tell him as a child. 'The soul of our ancestor Black Belize made a pact with the incarnation of ice.' 'A pact?' 'That when he awakens again, he will freeze the entire world.' 'Why doesn't he do it now?' 'Who knows. Maybe he's just resting until the time comes. So remember, never disturb the soul of our ancestor.' Not all legends are false. Black Matale knew this too well, and the reality that he couldn't stop the queen's atrocities was painful. "Is that all you have to say?" "......Yes." "I don't understand why you're so sensitive about an old legend. A legend is just a legend. Modern magic technology has advanced significantly. Even if a dragon appeared, we could hunt it. What is there to fear?" "Your Majesty... you know nothing." "Well, fine. But who knows? The Fire Spirit Flower of Adolevit might really melt the sea." The descendants of Black Belize are born with the blessing of the sea god and have an endless longing for the sea. But for over a thousand years, no one has been able to set foot on the sea. It was because of a special curse on their bloodline. 'Until the Black Cross ship of the pirate king awakens, no one can board a ship or go to sea.' All the ancestors who broke that rule... were swept away by the sea's disaster and met their deaths. Not even leaving a corpse behind. The pirates of the Black family lived their lives praying for the eternally frozen sea to melt, only to fade away. "Let's go back." After the queen left the hall, Black Matale stood up after a long time. He looked out the window at the sky... and lowered his head weakly. '...A disaster will come.' The current queen was foolish and arbitrary. She became queen not because she was fit to be a ruler, but because she was born with the most powerful blood of fire. 'In the end, all the rules our ancestors kept are broken in my generation.' He closed his eyes tightly and clenched his fists. He had no intention of running away. If that was his fate... he would witness everything from the center of the disaster. That was the only courtesy the last descendant of Black Belize could offer.

"This can't be...!" My hand holding the fork trembled. "It's more expensive than Stella...?" A city where the average cost of food is higher than Stella. Is this a city of nobles? Or is there a serious problem with the value of currency? When playing Aither World Online, the character didn't need to eat, so I didn't pay attention to such trivial details and had no idea why this was happening. "......How expensive is it that you're making such a fuss, kid?" "It's 500 credits more expensive than Stella. Does that make sense?" "What's the big deal about 500 credits..." The passing mercenary laughed in disbelief and walked away. Lisbon Port Branch, Mercenary Office. A thousand years ago, in the distant past, Lisbon, a super-large port that connected the entire world, had long lost its function. But after the sea froze, mysterious monsters and dungeons began to appear, making it a sanctuary for adventurers and mercenaries. Thanks to this, the mercenary office was quite developed, and the building was quite elegant. The royal palace officials were entitled to stay in a small palace attached to the Heavenly Ice Palace, but I had a different reason for coming all the way here to eat. 'While the royal family is proceeding with their work, I have to do my part too.' When Hong Biyeon, embodying the Fire Spirit Flower, reaches the heart of the vortex, the ghost of Black Belize, who had been sleeping in legend, will awaken. There's one ridiculous part about this. If things proceed smoothly here, the player will enjoy the summer vacation event at the academy and suddenly face a [Bad End]. It's an absurd development that leaves you with nothing but question marks. Just when you're about to raise your favorability with Mayuseong and Haewonryang, the world suddenly gets covered in ice. It wasn't a common occurrence, and only one in tens of thousands of players experienced it, so it wasn't a big topic... But I happened to be one of those tens of thousands of players. 'It was fun back then.' At that time, I used every means and method to solve this situation. An endless summer vacation. Repeating a world where everyone dies... I finally managed to prevent the ending where the world freezes because of Hong Biyeon. Back then, I didn't do it to save her but to protect my game data... But now, it didn't matter. Thanks to that, I knew a hidden piece that no one else knew. "Phew..." But honestly, this is a bit scary. If I make a mistake, I could really die. There are two 'bad ending flags' in this episode. The Fire Spirit Flower's incarnation of fire goes berserk, engulfing the Adolevit Kingdom in flames. Or the incarnation of ice on the pirate ship goes berserk, covering the world in ice. It seems hopeless, but... as long as I follow the plan, it will be fine. 'Sigh... what's the worst that could happen?' It's a bit scary, but if not me, no one else can do it. So, it's something I must do. With that determination, I could move without hesitation. After finishing my meal, I stood on the table. "Huh? What's that kid doing?" "Oh, a Stella student?" "Never seen him before." Drawing the attention of the mercenaries to me, I shouted. "Hidden dungeon discovered in the Whirling Ice Valley! Recruiting mercenaries, first come, first served! Welcoming those with all limbs intact and healthy organs!" Of course, that doesn't mean I plan to solve everything by myself. Sometimes, you have to deceive and use people to take the easy way, right? When I see protagonists in novels and comics, they have a habit of trying to solve everything alone... I can't do such troublesome things because I'm not the protagonist.
