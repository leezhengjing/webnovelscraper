I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 144

35. Inter-School Competition (2)

Previously, through Anella, I learned that the trauma within my mental world was truly the trauma of my own existence. I felt the need to think more deeply about this part.

"Who am I?"

It is indeed a philosophical question. Since humans began to recognize and think about their own existence, it has been a question continuously asked without end. However, no one knows the answer. I, of course, do not know either. But I had to delve into more detailed aspects from there.

"The Baek Yuseol of reality and the Baek Yuseol of Aether."

I, Baek Yuseol, who lived on Earth in the 21st century, played the character 'Baek Yuseol' in the game 'Aether World Online.' A character with the same name and even a similar appearance. Perhaps, more than the peculiarity of being a 'Blink One-Trick,' I felt a sense of kinship because the character resembled me, and I was endlessly drawn to it.

I played the game all night. On days off, I even saved time for sleep to practice blinking, and I studied how to deal with wizards while enjoying PVP frantically. The story? Of course, I pushed through to the end. Most of the story was skipped, so it didn't remain in my memory...

Anyway, the moment the game character Baek Yuseol reached the end of the story, the real Baek Yuseol, that is, I fell into the game world.

Is this place a game or not? If it's not a game, on what grounds can I confidently say so? I don't know. Everything I see, hear, and feel is so realistic that no matter how much I think about it, it feels like reality...

"...Why are the events that happened in the game being realized as my past?"

I organized the causal relationship of my existence on a blackboard hanging on the dormitory wall. My memories of reality are intact. However, very occasionally... the old memories of the character Baek Yuseol creep up. For instance, when I encounter people like Eltman Eltwin, whom the character Baek Yuseol met in the past...

The fact that memories from that time resurface when my experiences overlap with those of the character Baek Yuseol is evidence that the past memories remain somewhere in my subconscious. For now, this hypothesis is the most certain. The consciousness of the character Baek Yuseol has fallen asleep somewhere, and the consciousness of the real Baek Yuseol has been overlaid on top of it. Thus, the memories of reality are intact, but the memories from the character's time are not.

Returning to the beginning, if this world were truly a game... the character Baek Yuseol should not have any memories at all. As data composed of 0s and 1s, a character that moves only with the keyboard and mouse I control should not have memories. But undoubtedly, the memories of the character Baek Yuseol are asleep somewhere in my mind. Even before I possessed the character, even before I played the game...

It means that the character Baek Yuseol was moving and living on its own.

From there, I made a firm decision. This place was not a game, but I enjoyed it as if it were a game. A being that can create a reality like a game and run simulations. The 'Constellatio Project,' which was also the developer of Aether World Online, and the one who gave me rewards every time I completed an episode, sent me here. The reason the Constellatio Project possessed me into the character Baek Yuseol was because I was the one closest to the true ending.

In the future, the world will be destroyed. I knew that fact from the beginning, and it is true that I have been moving to prevent it until now. If so...

Was the character Baek Yuseol I played in 'Aether World Online' really just data of 0s and 1s? Or, was even the character I played actually a living, breathing person?

"Sigh..."

It was a question that had not been resolved for days. I thought the events I experienced in the game were just game events. But the past I experienced in the game appeared as the past of reality. All those countless failures, challenges, and deaths. And the black dragon I faced at the end of the world. If all of that was reality...

"How many times did I... no, did I kill Baek Yuseol?"

Suddenly, looking at the mirror hanging on the dormitory wall, I saw dark circles deeply settled. This worry returns several times without reaching an answer. Moreover, there was no one to ask.

"Hey. If you're listening, give me an answer. You talk to me well enough when I finish an episode."

Silence. Whether it was just a system or something that doesn't talk to me at any time... it was frustrating because it didn't give me an answer. In the end, I put down the pen. Thinking about it like this was meaningless. Even though I knew I couldn't come up with an answer by thinking alone, holding onto it was just a waste of time.

Someday. In the distant future. The day will come when I learn the truth about this world.

"Then... will you tell me?"

There was no answer this time either. But somehow, even though there was no answer, I felt as if it had affirmed me. Well... it might just be my imagination.

Anella was quite a useful and competent subordinate... not a bread shuttle.

"Recently, you said that the Moonlight Church seems to be concerned about Mayuseong, right?"

"Yes."

Lunchtime, in the cafeteria. Originally, exchange students and Stella students were supposed to eat in different cafeterias, but I deliberately came to the exchange students' cafeteria. This was the only place where I could talk to Anella alone. Meeting privately was a bit awkward.

"But... how long are you going to eat like that?"

Watching Anella nibble on an amount of food about three times that of a normal adult made me more uncomfortable.

"I-I'll eat hard!"

At my words, Anella started shoving food into her mouth with a ladle. I thought she might choke, but then I remembered she was a dark mage, so that wouldn't happen.

"Well, it's one thing that the Moonlight Church is concerned about Mayuseong... but why did Black Kingdom tell you to exclude me?"

Thanks to the 'Mute' item I received from Alterisha, I asked comfortably without worrying about our conversation leaking out. Anella hesitated and answered.

"Well... I want to tell you, but I don't know either. There are more confidential matters kept secret in case we get caught during a mission and reveal internal affairs..."

"Well, if I were them, I wouldn't tell someone like you either."

"That's too much..."

She glanced around cautiously and asked carefully.

"But... Yuseol-nim seems to be an ordinary student, so how do you know so much about our internal affairs...?"

I wondered if she was trying to subtly gather information, but Anella didn't seem smart enough for that. Of course, I had no intention of telling her.

"Do I have to tell you that too?"

"N-No! I'm sorry!"

"Just eat."

Unfortunately, Anella didn't know much about internal affairs. I couldn't just tell her to go and gather more information. Although she was submissive to me here, if she left Stella and returned to Black Kingdom, there was a high possibility she would betray me.

'I need something to keep Anella tied down...'

In the original game, Fullaim moved Anella's heart with a single sentence, completely turning her to his side... or so the story went. I didn't know the details. After all, this was my first time seeing a character like Anella.

Since I wasn't very good at talking, I didn't have the confidence to move her heart, so the only method left was 'trade.' A trade that would make her have no choice but to look at me.

"Anella. You said your dark magic is completely sealed right now, right?"

"Yes..."

Probably. If she returned without successfully completing the mission, the seal on her dark magic might never be lifted. But that was just a possibility. I couldn't bet on something uncertain.

'Anella's past.'

I slowly examined the binoculars. There weren't many records about her. I wasn't diligent enough to record every extra NPC. However...

'Wants to return to being human.'

I wasn't diligent, but I had a habit of recording the most important key elements clearly.

"Anella. Shall I make you a good offer?"

"...Yes?"

This would be a very good bait to keep her firmly tied down.

Scalven Club Room.

Under the sparkling chandelier, Jeremy slowly read the report with his shining golden eyes. Since most of the nobles of the Scalven Empire belonged to this club, there were quite a few participants in the inter-school competition. It was such a big deal that if even one participant came from a club, they would hold a celebration party that day, but it seemed unreasonable to expect that from the Scalven Club.

Jeremy just looked at the list of participants with indifferent eyes. The club members wondered why he suddenly took an interest in such things.

"Participants."

"Yes!"

"Yes!"

A golden halo seemed to emanate from his smiling face. He was so beautiful that he could be said to have a god-given appearance.

"There is... a rather unique participant in this Magic Survival. You know?"

"...Yes, I know."

First-year Class S, Baek Yuseol. A cheeky junior who recorded a high win rate against seniors and proudly made it to the inter-school competition. Considering that most participants in the inter-school competition were elite students from prestigious schools worldwide and at least 18 years old, Baek Yuseol was quite an unusual case. It might be something Stella Academy could be proud of, but as a senior, it didn't look good.

"Can I ask you for one thing?"

"Just say the word, Crown Prince."

"Eliminate Baek Yuseol."

The expected request came out. Everyone in the school knew that Jeremy disliked Baek Yuseol. After all... he was a commoner who had snatched away his crush, Fullaim. Although they had broken up now, rumors that Fullaim still had feelings for Baek Yuseol were making Jeremy quite uncomfortable.

"Will it be difficult?"

There was a reason Jeremy made such a trivial request. For the past few days, Fullaim had been concerned about Baek Yuseol's participation in the Magic Survival. She had been snooping around the class bulletin board, asking friends about Baek Yuseol's participation and how the judging went. It didn't sit well with him.

"No, it's very easy!"

The club members, who knew Jeremy's feelings well, answered energetically. Magic Survival. A game where 100 wizards are dropped in random locations to survive, and 'teaming' is strictly prohibited. However...

To perfectly eliminate Baek Yuseol with this number of people, teaming was essential.

'...This inter-school competition is ruined.'

Students who had grand ambitions to make a name for themselves through victory had no choice but to swallow their tears. But what could they do? Being marked by the Crown Prince of Scalven was more frightening.

"Then... please do your best, everyone."

Jeremy asked with a warm smile, and the club members nodded vigorously in response.

"Yes!"

It seemed that this Magic Survival would not go smoothly.
