# The Genius Who Became a Blink Mage at the Magic School

## Chapter 250: The Noble Soul (3)

Bang! The loud sound of someone slamming a desk startled Eijel awake. Her head was still foggy, and her vision blurry. It was only then that she realized she had been dozing off.

"Hey, are you sleeping?" Forcing her bleary eyes open and focusing her vision, she saw Flame grinning at her.

"…Yes, no?"

"Don't pretend you're not. Meditation time is basically nap time anyway."

"Ah." Only then did Eijel realize that the lecture she was attending was during meditation time. Normally, she would have fallen into a deep meditation, but she had been so tired these past few days that she couldn't focus properly and kept nodding off. It was a class where it didn't matter much whether she was meditating or sleeping, so she wouldn't get in trouble.

"Here, take a look at this. I'm busy, so I'll be off."

"What? Wait a minute…" Flame tossed a magazine onto her desk and hurried off with his friends into the hallway. Eijel tilted her head and checked the magazine.

**[Arcanium Magic Magazine]**

"Ah." Now that she thought about it, there was such a thing. The five prestigious schools of Arcanium often held joint club activities, and the 'Arcanium Magic Magazine' was a joint club of the magic newspaper clubs from the five schools. She had heard that there were quite a few clubs that conducted joint activities, but Eijel wasn't very interested in that, so she didn't know much about it.

"…As expected." Eijel skimmed through the magazine and smiled faintly. Witches, witches, witches. It was all about witches. The student reporters seemed eager to show that they could conduct interviews just as well as professional journalists, running around to interview professors and even members of the Stella Knights. Most of the content was about the mystery of how Bai Yuseol hunted the witch and praised the achievement of witch hunting. However, there was also a significant part that pondered why witches still existed in modern times, which was quite impressive.

But as expected, there were limits to what student reporters could do, and the core parts of the incident were all simplified. They didn't seem to know that Flame, Eijel, and the Myeoram group had helped from behind the scenes, nor did they mention that the witch's identity was the 'heir of the last witch.'

While reading the magazine lightly as a postscript, Eijel found a part that caught her attention.

"Hmm?" It was an interview with one of the Stella Knights. Unlike others, he didn't have a very favorable opinion of Bai Yuseol. He tried to speak as nicely as possible, but it was clear that he didn't think highly of Bai Yuseol.

"Bai Yuseol acts independently, has a self-centered mindset, and doesn't fit into group society."

Eijel deciphered the meaning as best as she could and concluded that it roughly implied that. It seemed that Bai Yuseol had somehow offended the Stella Knights. What could have happened?

"How did Bai Yuseol conduct a joint investigation with the Stella Knights?" This was a question in the article, and it was something Eijel was curious about as well. She had always thought there must be some connection since the Stella Knights' captain, Arain, showed a strong interest in Bai Yuseol. But she didn't expect the Stella Knights to move with a first-year student.

However, the result didn't seem to be very good. Not only had Bai Yuseol offended the Stella Knights, but there was also this news in the article.

"Bai Yuseol obtained temporary Stella Knight status but gave up the right himself. Why?"

Eijel widened her eyes and read the sentence again.

"He gave up the knight status immediately?"

The fact that Captain Arain had temporarily granted Bai Yuseol the authority of a knight was well-known throughout the school. But to give up the knight status as soon as the incident was over… there seemed to be no reason for that.

"Why on earth?" No matter how much she thought about it, she couldn't understand. There was no position as honorable as a Stella Knight for a magic warrior. Moreover, it was Captain Arain himself who had granted the temporary knight status. If Bai Yuseol had maintained the temporary knight status until graduation, he would have been guaranteed a high position. Given that he had successfully completed the witch-hunting mission, he could have enjoyed tremendous benefits in the future, but he gave it up without hesitation…

For Bai Yuseol, the position of a Stella Knight was probably just a temporary means to solve the immediate incident.

"…Even if he is a regressor." Or rather, because he was a regressor, he might have been able to make such a decision easily. For Bai Yuseol, who had lived countless lives, wealth and honor might no longer hold any meaning.

Due to a lack of time to read the magazine to the end, Eijel put it in her bag and left the classroom. The hallway was bustling, but she didn't pay much attention as it had become common recently due to preparations for club projects.

"I wonder what our club will do…?" The very concept of a gourmet club seemed unsuitable for presenting something in a club project. Bai Yuseol had been preparing a plan with the bizarre name 'Gourmet Road View Project,' but she didn't know how it was going. As someone who enjoyed eating anything delicious, Eijel didn't really understand the meaning of 'gourmet,' so she was honestly skeptical about his preparations. Moreover, she had had a very unpleasant experience at a witch's restaurant recently, which made her skeptical about the word 'gourmet.'

"Well… he'll handle it somehow." She decided to trust and leave it to him. Bai Yuseol was good at everything.

The entrance to the warp hall gate connecting the main tower and the separate tower was always crowded with students. This was because the warp hall could only head in one direction at a time. Students who wanted to go to location A would gather and depart simultaneously, while those who wanted to go to location B had to wait for a brief moment.

Usually, the group that gathered first or had the most students would move first. Since the academy was so large and the students were mostly strangers to each other, it was common for arguments to break out over the order of the warp hall. Due to technical limitations, even the professors couldn't find a solution.

Of course, there were very exceptional individuals who could end such arguments. If a professor used the warp hall gate… or if a student with a very strong presence used it.

This was exactly the case now. The students, who had been arguing over who would use the warp hall gate first, fell silent and stepped aside at the appearance of a third-year female student.

"Sairan Orkan." With black hair and doll-like pale skin, she had a very inorganic gaze, making it easy to understand why she was nicknamed the 'Living Doll.' Sairan was the eldest daughter of the Orkan Duke family, one of the two great families of the Adolevit Kingdom, and was also known as the right hand of Princess Hongshihwa.

Click-clack! As Sairan walked down the hallway, her attendants followed behind her. Each attendant was a student of Stella, but they had lived their entire lives with the sole goal of supporting the Orkan family, making their atmosphere quite different from other students. Their eyes, focused solely on Sairan, were so alien and chilling that the students kept their distance from them.

Buzz! The warp hall gate activated, changing its destination. Sairan waited for the warp hall to operate for her, as if it were the most natural thing, even though she had arrived last.

"Ahem, where are you headed?" The assistant managing the warp hall seemed awkward using honorifics with a student. It appeared he hadn't been managing the place for long. But what could he do? No matter how much of a student she was, he couldn't speak informally to a noble who lived in such high places.

"…To the 19th separate tower." Sairan spoke coldly, and the assistant nodded and began to operate the warp hall. Or at least, he tried to.

"Wait. I'll use it first. Move aside." That was until Hongbiyeon suddenly appeared. "Change it to the 13th separate tower."

Hongbiyeon, who appeared alone without any attendants, crossed her arms and slightly raised her chin, waiting. Her posture seemed to say, 'You have no right to refuse me,' making the assistant's face turn pale.

"Ugh…" The two were complete opposites. Sairan's presence made people accept her orders out of pure fear and terror, while Hongbiyeon's presence made people feel a fundamental sense of awe and reverence, as if they had to follow her orders.

But such trivial emotions didn't matter to the assistant. He was an ordinary person who had started managing the warp hall gate as a part-time job to get into the university tower, and he certainly didn't have the guts to face both the Orkan Duke family and the Adolevit royal family at the same time.

"…I was using it first, Princess." Sairan frowned, looking displeased, and Hongbiyeon tilted her head.

"Really? Then I'll use it first."

"That's not possible."

Sairan was clearly of lower status than Hongbiyeon, but that didn't mean Hongbiyeon could treat her carelessly. Sairan had the strong backing of Princess Hongshihwa.

"Not possible? Why?"

At Hongbiyeon's question, Sairan pressed her lips together. If she answered, 'Because I was here first,' Hongbiyeon would say this:

"Then what about those who were here before you?"

Sairan knew. She had power and was using it naturally. But this situation had never happened before. What should she do when a more powerful entity appeared and infringed on her rights?

Sairan thought. Why was Princess Hongbiyeon acting like this? Previously, she was just a prideful but self-deprecating trash, a pathetic inferior student who couldn't even be compared to Princess Hongshihwa. She wouldn't even dare to speak to Sairan, and if their eyes met, she would quickly run away. She never expected Hongbiyeon to openly pick a fight like this.

"No reason? Then I'll use it first."

"…Go ahead."

Hongbiyeon said that and naturally operated the warp hall, disappearing in an instant.

"Miss… are you alright?"

"That rude princess…"

"I'll report this separately later."

"Forget it." Sairan's eyebrows twitched in displeasure, but that was all. Letting her emotions get the better of her over such a trivial matter was something only amateurs did. To dominate the political scene in the future, she had to endure this level of humiliation. It could even be considered a good experience.

"You seem quite upset…"

"My bad mood isn't because of that."

Taking over the warp hall was understandable. But what bothered Sairan the most was…

Throughout their conversation, Hongbiyeon had been smiling brightly, as if she were the sun. It was as if something very good had happened to her. Since something good for Hongbiyeon was usually bad for Sairan, it naturally bothered her a lot. Not knowing what it was made her even more upset. And the brief moment of having to face that smile was extremely hard to endure.

"Even if I don't know the reason… there's no need to worry about it right now."

Sairan thought as she stepped into the warp hall. She was too busy to pay attention to someone like Hongbiyeon.
