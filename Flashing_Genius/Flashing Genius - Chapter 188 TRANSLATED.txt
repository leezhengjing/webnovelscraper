The next day, everything was frozen. The Adolevit royal family's vacation was nothing short of grand and splendid. Dozens of newly developed anti-magic automatic carriages, in collaboration with item technology, formed a procession. Elite magic knights of 5th class or higher guarded the royals on every street, and people waved and shouted at the royal family.

"Long live the Queen!"
"Long live Queen Adolevit!"

Even for a mere vacation, the citizens ran out into the streets and cheered. Was it genuine respect? Perhaps the current Queen Hong Seryu was close to being a tyrant. She had forcibly dethroned the previous queen, known as the former king, with power and authority, and had implemented oppressive politics. In a way, she was a truly terrifying figure.

I, as a palace servant attached to Hong Biyeon, could join the vacation trip but dared not ride in the same carriage as the princess. Well, it was only natural.

"Are you the Baek Yuseol I've heard rumors about?"
"I heard this guy is excellent at administrative work."

Other lower nobles and commoner palace servants also followed the vacation trip, but they were destined to work even at the 'Cheonhwa Ice Palace' located on the coast of Levian. After all, if the royals went on vacation and sent all the lower ranks on vacation too, the country wouldn't function.

"Judging by your complexion, you don't seem to be from here. Have you thought about working for the royal family after graduation? You could rise in status."

Just as there are subtle distinctions between Westerners and Easterners on Earth, it was the same here. I had a slightly Eastern look, while the people of Hong Biyeon's Adolevit Kingdom had a stronger Western feel.

"Ah, Director Markluk. Didn't you hear?"
"Hear what?"

A young man named Pahan looked at me with a subtle gaze and said, "This guy isn't someone who would aim for a status rise with mere administrative work."

"Then is he good at something else? Ah, since he's a Stella student, is he excellent at magic?"
"No, no. Not that. This guy is said to be very good with women."

Pfft! I spat out the drink I was sipping. Pahan, who was spouting nonsense about me, continued speaking as if nothing had happened, even with the drink all over him.

"They say he seduced the third princess."
"Ah... I heard that rumor too. I thought it was nonsense."
"Absolutely not. Don't you see him coming to the library every day?"

"The third princess is originally deeply into intellectual pursuits..."

"Director Markluk, are you going to keep saying obvious things without any fun? Can't you see? Do you think the third princess really only read books when she came to the library?"

The young man glanced at me and smiled lewdly. "They say she didn't read the books she was supposed to and just stared at this guy's face all day. There are many witnesses..."

"Let's stop there."

I was genuinely getting annoyed and frowned, and only then did Pahan stop talking with a cough. He seemed to be the type who couldn't read the room. Otherwise, he might have wanted to know the truth of the rumor by talking like that.

"It's not like that. The princess and I are just friends attending the same school."
"Eh! Friends can become lovers..."

"Stop it."

Director Markluk, seeing my expression, cut off Pahan's words, thinking it was best not to continue the joke. Except for his constant job offers, he was a very considerate person.

"Alright, alright."

As Pahan shrank back, the carriage became quiet. Thinking it was about time, I grabbed my coat. You might wonder why a coat in midsummer, but it was only natural since we were heading to the coast of Levian.

"Hoo, I'm looking forward to it."

As the weather started to get colder, Pahan's mouth opened again. Director Markluk, who seemed to have a lot of work even inside the carriage, spoke without taking his eyes off the pile of documents.

"Pahan, is this your first time going to the sea of Levian?"
"Yes, it is."
"Well... we're not going there to play, but enjoy it as much as you can. It's a famous tourist spot. You'll be amazed."

Listening to their conversation, I took out the coat I had prepared in advance from my backpack. It looked no different from a coat with the Stella mark, but it was enchanted with the highest performance cold resistance by Alterisha, so its contents were far from ordinary. It even had fur around the neck for decoration, giving it a full winter coat feel.

"Baek Yuseol, have you been there before?"
"I haven't been there."

But in the Aither World, it was a place I had visited dozens of times. Why did I visit so often? There must be a reason gamers frequent a place. First, it was good for grinding. Second, the difficulty was so extreme that the clear rate was abysmally low, requiring endless retries.

Unfortunately, my familiarity with this place was due to the second reason. Because of the Twelve Gods, how many times had my character died to clear the episode? So, I couldn't help but worry, but it was fine. Even without relying on the binoculars, I had enough experience to navigate the safest and most certain route.

'...Though I still have to take risks.'

The automatic carriage procession had left the land and was speeding along a waterway designed over the sea. Soon, a chilling cold swept in. Thanks to the coat I had put on in advance, I hardly felt the cold, but Pahan, sitting across from me, was already shivering despite wearing a padded jacket.

"Brr, it's cold..."
"Instead of shivering, why don't you enjoy the scenery outside?"
"Y-yes?"

Thinking it wasn't the time to work, Director Markluk also put down his documents and looked out the window. I, too, turned my gaze outside, trying to calm my pounding heart, knowing what spectacular sight awaited.

...At that moment, we were overwhelmed by the sight that filled our view. In the middle of the distant sea, there was a giant pirate ship. Unfortunately, the pirate ship was being sucked into a massive whirlpool with a diameter of 1 km...

"Wait, what is that...?"

To be more precise, the pirate ship wasn't being sucked into the whirlpool. It was frozen in place while being sucked in. The waterspout connecting the sea and sky, the whirlpool with a diameter of 1 km, the giant waves 100 meters high, and the sinking pirate shipâ€”all were frozen in place.

"...It's a magnificent sight every time."

Markluk adjusted his glasses and said, "You said this is your first time here, yet you don't seem that surprised? Usually, this is the normal reaction."

He pointed at Pahan, who was frozen with his mouth agape, and laughed. "It's my first time, but I've read a lot about it in books."

In truth, I had seen it several times in the graphics of the Aither World, so I could anticipate it. Of course, the vivid scene was incomparable to the game graphics, and I was momentarily dazed, but I didn't mention it.

"Haha, I've heard stories, but seeing it in person is a bit shocking..."

That reaction was normal. Others in the other carriages were probably reacting the same way. Seeing the world frozen was indeed... a strange feeling.

"But what is that ship...?"

"It's the pirate ship 'Black Cross' of the pirate king 'Black Belize,' who ruled all the seas a thousand years ago."

"Ah..."

"That day, the largest waterspout in history suddenly rose, creating that monstrous whirlpool. But there was no need to worry. The pirate king Black Belize had a very special trait called 'Blessing of the Sea God.'"

A special blessing that never lost its way on the sea and never sank the ship no matter what. The legendary pirate king Black Belize could have escaped that whirlpool.

"Then, everything froze."

"Why...?"

"If we knew that, would it still be like that?"

"Right..."

"Anyway, because of that disaster, the port city of 'Lisbon' on the coast of Levian completely lost its function and became just a villa for the Adolevit royal family."

As he finished speaking, I turned my gaze in the opposite direction. On the highest point of the Levian coast, there was a giant castle glowing blue.

'Just a villa, huh.'

No one would build such a castle for a mere villa. The Adolevit royal family had been seriously investigating some 'secret' buried in the Levian coast for a long time. The result was that giant Cheonhwa Ice Palace.

Why was the Adolevit royal family so obsessed with the secret of the Levian coast? Knowing the reason well, I quietly closed my eyes. I was a bit worried since I wouldn't be able to see Hong Biyeon for a few days...

'But she'll do well.'

I firmly believed in her.

* * *

The coast of Levian, Cheonhwa Ice Palace. The grand parade of hundreds of knights raising their staffs didn't impress Hong Biyeon much. After all, they were all showing respect to Queen Hong Seryu, not her.

"Welcome, Your Majesty."

As they entered the Cheonhwa Ice Palace, a man came out and knelt. He was 'Black Matale,' a descendant of Black Belize, who once ruled all the seas, and the current lord of the Cheonhwa Ice Palace.

"Yes. Have you been well?"
"Thanks to the grace of the sun. You must be tired from the long journey. I will guide you immediately."
"No. Before that, I have a place to go with my daughters."

At her signal, three women in white priest robes appeared, carrying a large treasure chest. Matale, seeing this, widened his eyes and bit his lip.

"...I see. Understood."

The emotion on his face was unmistakable anger. But he didn't resist and stepped back quietly.

'A place to go?'

Listening from behind, Hong Biyeon couldn't understand what they were talking about. But Hong Siwha seemed to have an idea, smiling and tapping her shoulder.

"Oh my, sister. It's your first time seeing it, right?"
"Don't talk to me."

"Why so stiff between us?"

It genuinely annoyed her that there was something about the royal family she didn't know. But she had to endure. She might gain some important information this time.

"Let's go."

As Black Matale led the way, Queen Hong Seryu followed. Hong Siwha, with light steps like a swan, quickly followed behind, but for some reason, no guards or servants followed. Only the three priests stayed close to the queen.

'...A place only royals can enter.'

Hong Biyeon followed them with slightly slower steps. In the basement of the Cheonhwa Ice Palace, there was a secret place whose construction date was unknown. The corridor was wide but dark, barely lit enough to see a step ahead.

"...We've arrived."

After walking for a long time through the underground corridor, they arrived at a large cavity. In the center was a high altar, and the queen and the three priests climbed it without hesitation.

"Why are you not following?"

Startled, Hong Biyeon realized she was left alone. Hong Siwha, who had gone ahead, looked back and winked playfully, making her feel even worse. She hurriedly climbed the altar, where the three women surrounded the precious chest they had brought.

Then, Hong Seryu tapped the chest with her staff. Srrr... Fwoosh! The chest melted away, revealing its contents.

"Ah...!"

Hong Biyeon couldn't help but exclaim. It was none other than the Fire Spirit Flower. The royal family's heirloom she had once vowed to obtain to save Baek Yuseol from his terminal condition. But something was strange.

'Why is it burning like that?'

According to legend, the Fire Spirit Flower was dormant and didn't emit even a spark. But look at it. The Fire Spirit Flower before her eyes was shining as brightly as a sun about to explode.

"Second Princess, Hong Siwha."
"Yes~"
"Third Princess, Hong Biyeon."
"...Yes."

The queen recited the princesses' names. "Would you do anything for the royal family and the kingdom?"

Only then did Hong Biyeon realize something was wrong. The vacation to the Levian coast wasn't just to exile her. 'Could it be, they plan to...'

Realizing this, Hong Biyeon felt a sense of futility. What could compare to this feeling of falling endlessly into an abyss?

"Of course~"
"Third Princess. Answer."

Though Hong Siwha answered, the queen didn't listen. From beginning to end, the queen was looking at Hong Biyeon.

'Ah.'

In the end, she closed her eyes tightly and laughed. "Haha..."

But it was fine. Even in this wave of endless despair, Hong Biyeon felt hope. 'Baek Yuseol. You knew this too, didn't you?'

She firmly believed in him. He knew everything and could do anything. He must have known this trial would come to her. And he must have believed she could overcome it, so he sent her here.

Hong Biyeon, with her ruby-colored eyes shining coldly, looked at the queen and the second princess. She could no longer believe they were the same humans as her.

"...Yes."

So Hong Biyeon put on a mask. Just like Hong Seryu and Hong Siwha did. To hide her emotions filled with anger. She still couldn't believe in herself. "Of course."

But... she believed in the 'me' that he believed in, so she could answer without hesitation.
