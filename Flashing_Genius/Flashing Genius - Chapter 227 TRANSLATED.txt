# Chapter 227: The Start of the Semester (1)

Zap! With a sensation of sparks flying before my eyes, my body was jolted back to reality.

"Ugh..."

I opened my eyes on the dormitory bed and hastily checked my limbs. The horrific wounds and pain from being crushed by the giant's kicks, with rocks flying everywhere, were completely gone. However, if I had failed that stage... all those wounds and pain might have transferred to reality.

"Phew... I thought I was going to die."

The 500-year-old witch's crystal ball. It can rapidly increase one's abilities in a short period, but it's extremely difficult and dangerous, requiring utmost caution. I almost made a fatal mistake at the end. Still, my abilities have significantly improved, yielding quite satisfactory results.

**[Baek Yuseol]**

* **Stats**
  * **Endurance**: ã€‡ Star 99%
  * **Mental Power**: 4 Stars 03%
  * **Magic Power**: -

* **Skills**
  * **Blink Lv.3**
  * **Tai Ling Divine Art Lv.2**

* **Traits**
  * **Magic Leakage Delay Lv.3**
  * **Blessing of the Red Spring March Lv.3**
  * **Blessing of the Bronze December Lv.1**
  * **Blessing of the Silver November Lv.1**
  * **Contractor of the Divine Beast Yphanel**

Most of my stats have either grown by a stage or are on the verge of growth.

'The growth rate is truly astonishing... To think that the abilities that had been stagnant for months would explode like this in such a short time. I didn't expect this level of effect. But still, my endurance just won't increase no matter what. When I played Aether World Online, I remember increasing my endurance... but I can't recall how. Was there a special condition? Or did I use equipment items? It's not an urgent stat, but I'm tired of the risk of collapsing from a single hit.'

'Still, having more blessings feels reassuring.'

That day, after returning to the modern world with the help of Jellyel, I checked my status window and found the Blessing of the Silver November, which I didn't know when it was granted. It seems that the Silver November had already bestowed its blessing on me from the day I pierced through time.

...The effect is somewhat peculiar compared to other blessings, making it difficult to use properly. Since I never received the Blessing of the Silver November in Aether World Online, I will have to research this skill from scratch.

'I'll research this later when I have more time.'

I stared intently at the witch's crystal ball. The thrill of seeing my stats rise dramatically with each training session was becoming addictive, making me want to dive into the mini-game repeatedly. But I mustn't do that. The reason the 500-year-old witch died without living out the remaining two years of her life was because she failed to control the difficulty while training her body inside this crystal ball to escape from witch hunters. It's a truly absurd story. To die while practicing to survive... what a meaningless death. Or maybe not so meaningless, since I am now using that item properly.

'I'll wait a bit... and prepare thoroughly for the next stage.'

As I carefully put the witch's crystal ball into my backpack, a thought struck me.

'Come to think of it... it's been almost half a year since alchemy and magic engineering were developed. At that time, I could only make crude items, but now it's time for Alchemist Altair to truly showcase his genius. The difference between Altair when technology was being developed piece by piece and Altair when all technologies were completed is vast. If the technology has advanced as much as I think, it should be enough to create a 'subspace backpack.' Even if not for that reason, I haven't visited in a while. Despite being a co-developer, I've been reaping all the profits. Since I have no classes this afternoon and the short ones are just orientations, I should visit after a long time.'

The International Alchemist Organization, Alchemy City. This city, established by alchemists who shed their national affiliations, was bustling with alchemists of various races. I could see that the population had increased even more since my first visit half a year ago. The reason was obvious. Alchemy, once considered a minor field, had now become a core technology responsible for modern advancements under the name of magic engineering. Alchemists no longer had to bow their heads before wizards. Even small alchemy or magic engineering seminars were as large as major magic seminars, making the official alchemy conference next year highly anticipated.

**[Altair School]**

"Oh, wow."

In the heart of Alchemy City, the massive fortress established by international alchemist scholars had never allowed any school to bear its name. Yet, the name of the Altair School was proudly displayed there. Does this mean her influence is strong enough to break even the traditions of alchemists?

Entering the building, I was greeted by a design that was quite modern and reminiscent of Earth. I didn't instruct them to do so; it was just the original atmosphere of this place. Perhaps it's because this city is one of the fastest in technological advancement.

"Oh my, it's Cadet Baek Yuseol. Please come this way. I'll guide you."

"Yes."

Now, I don't even need to mention my name. The receptionist recognized me and escorted me. The exclusive elevator she guided me to ascended to the top floor. Ding! As the door opened, the receptionist stepped back, wishing me a pleasant day, and I nodded as I entered.

Contrary to the dark and gloomy image one might have of an alchemist's lab, with mysterious residues crawling everywhere, it was nothing like that. The space was entirely white, and the alchemists, who were the cleanest of all, wore white lab coats.

'...Amazing.'

Seeing so many alchemists in white lab coats bustling around made me feel somewhat awkward. I quickly put on the lab coat handed to me by the receptionist and wandered inside until I found Altair's office. The word "office" felt oddly out of place.

Knock, knock!

"Yes!"

As I knocked, the door swung open, and Altair appeared.

"Oh my?"

She widened her eyes in surprise, shaking her pink hair tied back.

"Cadet Yuseol! It's been a while!"

"Yes... I've been a bit busy."

"That's an understatement. Come in. Would you like some coffee?"

"Oh, no. I'm fine."

Entering the room, I saw a few familiar alchemists and the Golden Alchemist, Hwarseok Corden. He looked at me with tired eyes and waved.

"Long time no see! Kid, it's really hard to see your face."

"Yes. I've been a bit busy."

"Well, everyone has their reasons."

By the way, what's going on? I came to check the progress of the technology, but seeing the alchemists gathered and discussing something seriously made it hard to ask.

"...What's going on?"

When I asked cautiously, Altair smiled awkwardly and sighed.

"Let me explain."

"Yes... Come over here. You'll understand right away."

What is it?

She led me to a seat among the alchemists and pointed to a paper on the experiment table.

"This is the 'Prototype Magic Circle of Bericta' we were experimenting with a week ago. It's meant to preserve the original form while adding enchantments... Oh, I don't need to explain. You'll understand right away."

No. What is this?

It's a new technology not even recorded in the Finch Glasses. Of course, I could quickly interpret it by consuming some mental power, but I never imagined they would develop such new technology.

"So, what's the issue?"

"The thing is... we didn't develop this."

"...What?"

"Even though we bear the title of magic engineers, we haven't mastered magic engineering yet. It's embarrassing, but that's the reality."

"Ah."

That's true. Although they achieved the tremendous feat of combining alchemy and magic engineering, expecting outstanding magic engineering from the alchemists gathered in Alchemy City is difficult. That's why the technology hasn't exploded in development. Altair is expected to become the greatest genius in magic engineering within a year, but that's in the future. Currently, the lack of magic engineering skills means the alchemists in Alchemy City have to study magic engineering belatedly, and they are also recruiting excellent magic engineers from outside... but it's not easy.

Still, after three months of research with a decent magic engineer, they were struggling with the 'Prototype Magic Circle of Bericta.' One night, a scholar accidentally left it in the lab and went home. The next morning, when they returned... the magic circle was completed.

"...That's spooky."

"Right?"

"Phew, we're more curious about 'who' completed it than the fact that it was completed."

It's great that the magic circle was completed. But the fact that someone finished what they had been struggling with for three months in just one night was quite shocking.

"...We need that person's help."

Although tampering with an alchemist's experimental formula is punishable, now is not the time to argue about such things. A brilliant magic engineer. Even if it's a ghost, the scholars would gladly extend their hand.

"Can't we investigate everyone who accessed the lab?"

"That's true, but... there are too many. Nearly hundreds of people, and even if we meet each one, if they hide it well, we can't find out. This magic engineer was meticulous enough not to leave any fingerprints."

"I see."

They probably won't find that magic engineer after this incident. In fact, I had a hunch from the moment I heard this story. This is one of the 'Altair Hidden Episodes.'

'This is the episode where the potential of technology explodes.'

Depending on whether they find that magic engineer or not, the speed of technological growth will differ significantly. Even if they don't find them, there's no need to be anxious since Altair has already developed magic engineering before the Black Horse. But if they can find and further promote technological development, it would be beneficial.

"I'll find them."

"Huh? Really? You don't even know the faces of the people in Alchemy City. We couldn't find them either."

"Yeah, kid. No matter how much of a genius you are, this is a different story."

"No. I can do it even without knowing their faces. Leave it to me."

"...Well, if you say so. We have nothing to lose. We've half given up anyway."

When Hwarseok Corden agreed, the alchemists below him automatically nodded.

"Yes. I'll definitely find them."

**Stella Academy, First-Year Student Division**

"Here it is, Princess."

The assistant placed several large timetables on the table, and Hong Biyeon scrutinized them. They contained the personal schedules of first-year students, which weren't particularly secret, so it wasn't because she was a princess that she could view them. It was just that very few Stella students bothered to look for such trivial things, making it a bit curious.

Most Stella students were self-centered, and the S-Class even more so, rarely showing interest in others' schedules. So, it was quite unusual for Hong Biyeon to be looking for this.

"I've checked."

"Already? I went through the trouble of getting them..."

"Yes."

She seemed to be interested in only one person's schedule, quickly confirming it and leaving. The assistant, who had prepared the schedules for the princess, looked disappointed, but that was none of Hong Biyeon's concern. As she exited the student division and closed the door, she unexpectedly met eyes with someone.

Eizel. She looked at Hong Biyeon with a sour expression.

"...What brings you here?"

"None of your business."

"Well, it's obvious."

Flinch. Hong Biyeon felt a surge of anger at Eizel's knowing tone but suppressed it. Losing her temper here would be undignified. Instead, she glared at Eizel with a cold gaze and asked.

"What do you want?"

"I had business with the student division too. I just happened to run into you."

"If that's the case, don't waste my time with unnecessary chatter."

Saying that, Hong Biyeon tried to turn away quickly, but Eizel grabbed her arm.

"...What is this?"

Genuinely baffled, Hong Biyeon lowered her gaze and asked, and Eizel, after a moment of hesitation, sighed and spoke with difficulty.

"Morfran Forest."

"You know, the place managed by the Adolevit royal family and the Magic Association."

"I know."

Why do I know? How do I know? She didn't bother to explain. It would only hurt Eizel. She's not the type to be considerate like that. It's just that explaining would be pointless... so Hong Biyeon kept her words brief.

"Can you use your authority to access that place?"

After a brief moment of contemplation, Hong Biyeon denied it.

"No."

That ended the conversation. Eizel watched Hong Biyeon's retreating figure with a dejected expression. She didn't expect her request to be granted, but... it was still disappointing.

"Phew, I'll have to find another way..."

As Eizel turned and disappeared down the corridor, Hong Biyeon frowned slightly.

'Morfran Forest?'

Although she had denied it to Eizel, as a member of the Adolevit royal family, Hong Biyeon could access the forest if she wanted to. She just found it bothersome and didn't want to grant Eizel's request, so she said no.

'Why Morfran Forest all of a sudden...? Eizel is eccentric, but if she went so far as to ask me, it must be something important. It's not just curiosity. There's definitely something there.'

'...Should I look into it?'

Hong Biyeon lightly considered the matter and decided to keep it in the back of her mind. She didn't think it was a big deal.
