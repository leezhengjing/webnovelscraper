### Chapter 156: Magic Survival (8)

Using a large amount of mana at once to heal the patients, Puleim was safely transferred to the emergency room. Of course, since it was merely a case of mana exhaustion, he was moved to a nearby ward after receiving a recovery potion without any special treatment.

“Ugh... My head feels like it's going to explode...”

It took less than an hour for Puleim to regain consciousness. Thanks to his vast mana capacity and excellent recovery ability, he woke up quickly.

“...Are you okay?”

The first face he saw upon waking up was Anella. Although she was pretending to hide her true identity, Puleim could see through it clearly.

“Hey, why are you here?”

“...I came with you.”

“Is that so.”

Anella glanced nervously behind her, urging Puleim to look in that direction as soon as possible. There, a rather unfamiliar figure was watching a broadcast through the screen door on the wall.

“Are you awake now?”

It was Princess Hong Biyeon.

“Uh... Why are you here?”

Puleim asked with a slightly bewildered expression, as he hadn't expected her appearance. However, Hong Biyeon ignored the question and got straight to the point.

“What is happening in the Magic Survival right now?”

“Oh, that.”

This was a completely new development that did not exist in the original story. In the original, there were no dark mages infiltrating the Magic Survival, Anella did not offer any help, and Hong Biyeon was not involved at all. But this was not a 'story' created by characters; it was a real reality created by me and the others. I had become accustomed to accepting such sudden situations.

“What do you think is happening? It's obvious.”

Puleim casually got off the bed and stretched.

“It's the dark mages. Those cockroach-like guys have infiltrated again. They never seem to get tired of it. Are there any here too?”

Anella flinched and looked away, fidgeting with her fingers. It was amusing because, according to the setting, she was much older than an average student... in her 30s or 40s. She didn't look it at all.

“Well, you probably knew about this. Hmm, it seems you're worried about that man?”

Puleim spoke sharply, but Hong Biyeon's red eyes remained calm and unwavering. With no other choice, Puleim shook his head and said,

“Actually, I don't know much either. I don't know what's happening inside. All I know is... the dark mages who infiltrated the virtual world can actually attack the wizards. And their level is quite high. At least a 5-risk level.”

“Why don't they stop the competition?”

“They can't. They created a completely separate space, and to bring them back, they need to cast a spell. If they do that, there could be casualties, so the principal asked that man to deal with the dark mages.”

Hong Biyeon's eyebrows twitched. She seemed deeply displeased.

“A principal can't solve the problem himself and asks a student?”

“Yeah... that's how it is.”

The conversation ended there. Hong Biyeon turned back to the screen door, and Puleim also ended up watching it. Since this was a ward inside the Stella Dome, it was possible to monitor the Magic Survival in real-time. It was very convenient to control the remote and find the participant you wanted. Of course, you could only monitor participants standing in places illuminated by the sun or moonlight inside the stage, but fortunately, Baek Yuseol was wandering outside and was shown on the screen.

He was running somewhere urgently, ignoring the surrounding terrain, artifacts, and even enemies trying to fight him. Most spectators wouldn't understand why Baek Yuseol was acting that way, but the girls here could immediately tell. He must have discovered a dark mage and was rushing towards them. The opponent was a 5-risk dark mage. Normally, a student wouldn't stand a chance. But if that student was Baek Yuseol... there was a mix of hope and worry that he might win. After all, in this fight, he had to endure the dark mage's one-sided attacks.

The girls remained silent, just staring at the screen. The reality that they could only watch felt particularly cruel today.

Boom! Flash!

A white lightning bolt struck the ground as if trying to split the world in half. It looked like a natural lightning strike, but it was actually the effect of a top-tier, one-time-use artifact, [Lv.5 Thunderbolt Origin]. It could be created by gathering five talisman artifacts in a very special place, but the conditions were so stringent that it appeared in only one out of a hundred matches. No one intentionally sought out the five items, and even if they tried, it was difficult to gather them all before the match ended. Even if they did gather them, the activation conditions were extremely strict.

'Activate at the designated location, and lightning will strike in 5 minutes.'

The destructive power could kill the opponent in one hit, but the range was very narrow, and the casting time was 5 minutes. How could you know where the opponent would be in 5 minutes and drop the lightning there? Despite its overwhelming performance, it had so many absurd risks that it was considered a fun artifact. Of course, I had identified the locations of the five items through the binoculars and collected them all to create the 'Thunderbolt Origin,' just in case I needed it. And now, support had arrived. Principal Eltman Eltewin had marked the location of the dark mage, Baron Kal, on the map. As soon as I saw Jelliel and Baron Kal encounter each other, I roughly designated the location for the lightning. I hoped that luck would be on my side and hit either of them. If Jelliel got hit, she would be safely eliminated and sent outside. If Baron Kal got hit, he would be subdued by the waiting warriors outside.

“Huff, huff...”

After running for a while, I arrived at the hill, and the situation was almost over. Jelliel was lying on the ground, unable to move. She was severely burned all over her body, and it was questionable whether she could even recover properly.

'Where is Baron Kal...'

The debris from the lightning was scattered everywhere, making it hard to see. I hurried to Jelliel and gently supported her neck.

“Hey, are you okay? You're not dead, right?”

Jelliel slowly opened her eyes. She had golden eyes, just like her father, who could see the golden rule. Even with red marks all over her body, her eyes were as beautiful as jewels. I quickly shook my head to erase that thought.

“You...”

“Never mind, go back quickly. You can still get treatment now.”

Thud!

I stabbed a secondary dagger into her heart, and her body turned into light and disappeared. She was eliminated and sent outside. This concluded the situation to some extent.

'If there was a system for self-elimination, this wouldn't have happened...'

To take one's own life, one had to jump into a natural disaster, expose oneself to the barrier outside the competition area, or turn off all shields and jump from a high place. But this was an open hill, and there were no natural disasters, so it seemed difficult to take one's own life. It was a miracle that Jelliel held on this long. After sending her back, I closed my eyes and focused, spreading my [Sixth Sense] in all directions. My sense, which was superior to the mana scans of wizards, clearly detected all hidden mana traces. I thought he would have died from the lightning, but just in case, I spread my sixth sense.

Crack!

Suddenly, the rock I was standing on shattered, and a hand wreathed in dark red flames shot out, aiming for my throat. Thanks to activating my sixth sense, I quickly reacted and jumped back, barely avoiding it. The debris of burnt trees, dirt, and rocks fell off as something slowly revealed its upper body.

“Damn it, why do you keep bothering me?”

Baron Kal glared at me. His body was half-burnt from the lightning, but he still looked fine. He had no means to defend against the lightning, so it seemed he was lucky enough to be only slightly grazed. No wonder Jelliel, who was nearby, wasn't much affected by the lightning. I quickly drew my weapon. Unfortunately, it wasn't a sword but a club. But that didn't matter. The reason I used a sword was to shape my mana into a blade. As long as I could penetrate the opponent's shield and deal direct damage, the form didn't matter.

“Ha, Baek Yuseol! I've been looking for you. I was annoyed by constant interruptions, but this is perfect.”

Whoosh!

He ignited dark red flames in his hands and grinned menacingly. It was a grotesque smile that no human face could make, sending a chill down my spine.

“If I burn you... this frustration will be relieved, right?”

It was a head-on confrontation. Both of us were exhausted, but... the dark mage's recovery speed far surpassed that of a human. If I fought properly, I couldn't win. He would surely track my teleportation patterns with his monstrous reflexes and burn everything. So, in fact... I had no intention of fighting properly. This was the Magic Survival arena. As long as I could eliminate the opponent in any way, it didn't matter. Warriors were waiting outside to deal with Baron Kal. In a normal fight, my chances of killing Baron Kal would be very low, but in a survival match, the methods of elimination were different.

As I slowly backed away, Baron Kal lowered his stance and said,

“Were you a knight? Then... I'll face you in a similar manner!”

Bang!

With a powerful leap, Baron Kal closed the distance in an instant. Thinking I couldn't dodge by rolling, I used a short teleport of about 2 meters diagonally to the side and swung my club at his back.

“Where do you think you're going!”

But he reacted like a ghost, spinning his body and deflecting my club with his flame-wreathed hand. Overwhelmed by his sheer strength, I grabbed my throbbing wrist and jumped back. Baron Kal then slammed his hand into the ground.

“Explode!”

Boom!

The ground cracked, and black flames erupted towards me like a volcanic explosion. Knowing that the attack could only move in a straight line, I easily dodged to the side and used teleportation twice in a row. First, behind Baron Kal.

[Teleport]

“Same trick again!”

Then, to the opposite side.

[Teleport]

Whoosh!

Taking advantage of the moment when Baron Kal swung his flames at my previous position, I moved to his side and struck his head with my club.

Thud!

“Ugh...”

Despite the impact, Baron Kal reached out for me. His persistence was terrifying, but I stepped on his hand and tumbled away, throwing a few orbs at him.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

They were smoke bombs that caused minor damage and obscured vision, but they were quite unpleasant to get hit by. Of course... such artifacts wouldn't cause significant damage to him.

Whoosh!

As proof, the dark red flames burned even more intensely.

“You...”

Baron Kal clenched his fists, now as large as campfires, and slowly walked towards me. He seemed relaxed, but it was a preparatory move to react to my movements. Using teleportation hastily would only waste its cooldown. So, I...

I took out the artifact [Frog Tongue] and threw it at Baron Kal.

“Ugh?!”

A pink tongue shot out and stuck to Baron Kal's chest, pulling him towards me. All players in Magic Survival were systemically balanced, so even a dark mage couldn't completely ignore the influence of artifacts. However, he could resist. Baron Kal grabbed the frog tongue with both hands and burned it, but he had already shown an opening.

Beep... Boom!

I had attached a 'gift box that explodes in 5 seconds' to the frog tongue, and I threw myself backward as Baron Kal took the full impact.

“Ugh... Can't you fight properly? Is this how a magic warrior fights?”

He shouted at me as I ran in a wide circle to create distance.

“Cowardly! Despicable! Fighting so dirty! Have you thrown away your honor, Stella's magic warrior?”

Hearing that, I couldn't help but smirk.

“Thanks for the compliment. This is how you fight.”

Dirty and despicable? That was the highest praise I could receive!

[Teleport]

I ran towards the trees on the other side of the hill, and Baron Kal chased me with a terrifying expression. His forehead had sprouted horns, and his hands had grown so large they could cover an entire face. Unlike before, when he maintained a human form, his rage had reached its peak, and he had taken on the full appearance of a dark mage.

'Ugh, this is dangerous...'

Whoosh! Boom!

A dark red fireball shattered the rock I had stepped on, no, it vaporized it. The destructive power was far greater than before. If I got hit by one of those, I might really die, treatment or not.

'This won't do... there's still time until 'that' arrives. To hold out until then, I have no choice but to use this skill I really didn't want to.'

[Tae Ryung Divine Art: Breath of the Spirit, Second Form]

[Agility 150% Boost]

“Hoo...”

As I inhaled and exhaled, the breath of the spirit enveloped me. The clear spirit energy slowly filled my body, boosting one of my stats to the extreme. It felt like everything in the world had slowed down. The pouring rain seemed to almost stop. It looked like I could touch it with a finger and it would burst like a bubble. The distant lightning bloomed like a flower. Beautiful. I realized for the first time today that the world could be so beautiful and dazzling when it slowed down.

Whoosh!

Even the dark red flames rushing towards me were no longer a threat. For just 15 seconds, in this slowed-down world, I could dodge everything without using teleportation. One step, and it brushed past my waist. Two steps, and it crashed into the spot I had just left. Three steps, and it missed me entirely, hitting somewhere else.

Boom!

But the fireballs only lasted for a short while. Eventually, Baron Kal couldn't stand it anymore and used his superior physical abilities to jump and quickly catch up to me.

Whoosh! Boom...

The rain continued to pour heavily. I reached the edge of a cliff and slowly turned around. Baron Kal, who had approached me, stared at me.

“This is the end.”

Two steps back, and there was a thousand-foot drop. There was no escape. I had to settle it here, but the terrain was too narrow to utilize my mobility. Knowing this, Baron Kal approached leisurely, like a cat hunting a cornered mouse. But...

All of Baron Kal's leisure was just a blessing to me.

“Yeah, it's the end.”

“...Have you finally accepted reality?”

“No. What are you talking about?”

The rain grew heavier. The dark clouds sparked strangely, and the thunder grew more frequent. This was the stage. Natural weather phenomena didn't exist. And I knew exactly when, where, and how every 'natural disaster' would occur...

Boom! Boom!

“W-What...?”

In the distance, a 'thunderstorm' suddenly began. It hadn't reached here yet, but it was slowly approaching.

'Those cursed by the Thunder God Hailges, everything in his sight will burn.'

At the edge of the cliff, with the thunderstorm at my back, I spoke to Baron Kal.

“You're the one who's finished. Do you understand now?”

...And then, the white rain swept through the area.
