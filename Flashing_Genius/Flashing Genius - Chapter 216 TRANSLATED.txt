The next day arrived. My custom-made uniform was produced quite quickly, but perhaps because my frame was still much smaller than an adult's, I didn't feel particularly satisfied when I saw myself in the full-length mirror. The design of the uniform wasn't much different from the Stella cadet uniform. Although the overall blue color scheme and the numerous decorations were slightly bothersome, the uniform itself was quite stylish, befitting the (fake) heroine's family. When I put on the mask, it seemed like a decent disguise. Someone as sensitive to mana as Grand Duke Isaac Morf might recognize my unique constitution, but such people are rare.

"Shall we go...?"

Although I felt quite uneasy, I decided to bury my worries deep within my heart. Worrying wouldn't change anything.

* * *

The Grand Duchy of Morf. The Morf Forest. Although not very large, this place, where the legendary beast was sealed by the disciple of the ancient wizard, the "Great Morf," is off-limits to anyone not of the Morf bloodline. To maintain the seal on the beast, the ice magic of the Morf bloodline was essential, and for a thousand years, they guarded this place, barring outsiders due to its danger.

And now, a thousand years after the beast's sealing, the Morf Forest had to allow external forces for the first time. The Red Sun Knights of Adolevit, along with the mages from the Mage Association and the Magic Tower, participated in large numbers, presumably drawn in by Hong Si-hwa.

"Nice to meet you. I am Hong Si-hwa of Adolevit."

"I am Alec Vailen of the Mage Association."

"I am Kasak, the vice-tower master of the Blue Crystal Magic Tower. It's an honor to meet you."

"I am Verdun, the director of the World Mage Organization."

"Nice to meet you. I am Grand Duke Isaac Morf."

The meeting between the Red Sun Knights of Adolevit in their red uniforms and the Morf Knights in their blue uniforms. Since it wasn't a meeting conducted in the right way, the Morf knights glared at the Adolevit soldiers with fierce eyes.

'Their impressions are completely different.'

I stood at the back, quietly observing Hong Si-hwa. The atmosphere was distinctly different from her playful demeanor ten years later; she now exuded a calm and composed coldness.

After shaking hands, Isaac and Hong Si-hwa entered the command tent. Following them, the mages from the association and the tower, as well as Isaac's aide Wilhelm, entered, and I cautiously stepped inside as well. Wilhelm didn't seem pleased with me, but he didn't say anything, possibly due to Isaac's orders.

The atmosphere inside the command tent was certainly tense and cold. As the knights of both countries glared at each other as if they wanted to kill, I quietly stood behind Isaac.

"First of all... I want to express my apologies for forcibly bringing troops into the Grand Duchy of Morf."

"I also find it regrettable."

"According to the calculations of the Red Sun Magic Tower's constellation triangulation, the barrier sealing the beast will weaken in less than a month."

The Red Sun Magic Tower of Adolevit, known as a candidate for the 'Great Tower' after the Full Moon Tower, was one of the world's top magical institutions, famous for its unique constellation triangulation magic calculation formula.

"No matter how great the disciple of the ancient wizard, the Great Morf, was, and no matter how excellent the Morf family's magic is, maintaining a single barrier for a thousand years is a miracle in itself."

Their computational power, capable of calculating magic from centuries past to future magic, was almost supernatural. According to their information, the beast in the Morf Forest would awaken in a month. It's a ridiculous story. They believe their thoughts and calculations are correct and are pushing forward, causing great harm to the Grand Duchy of Morf.

"Princess Hong Si-hwa."

Isaac Morf spoke to her with a stern expression.

"If this goes wrong, you will bear a great diplomatic responsibility."

"Of course."

Hong Si-hwa answered nonchalantly and gestured to the back. Two of Adolevit's aides appeared and spread a magic scroll on the table, revealing a holographic view of the Morf Forest.

"This is quite... unpleasant."

The Morf Forest, strictly off-limits to outsiders and essentially the heart of the Grand Duchy of Morf, had been thoroughly mapped out. It was a serious diplomatic issue, but Hong Si-hwa casually bowed her head in apology.

"I'm sorry. The Adolevit royal family decided to handle this matter seriously."

"I also think I should handle the Adolevit royal family's rudeness seriously. We will meet again in an official setting after this matter is over."

"Yes, understood."

Is the subjugation of the beast so important that they are willing to bear such losses? Or do they not care about Isaac's words at all? Hong Si-hwa's voice was so devoid of emotion that it was impossible to understand her intentions.

"In fact, we should have discussed this matter earlier."

"What do you mean?"

"Regarding the existence of this beast itself..."

As the nerve-wracking tension was about to escalate, I sensed something strange from outside the tent and turned my head. Naturally, I couldn't see anything since I didn't have clairvoyance. However, thanks to the blessing of the Silver Eleven Moon, I could sense something peculiar that no one else in this place could.

Because this aura... 'Isn't it a dark mage?'

Yet no one else seemed to notice. Surely, no one else had sensed it. 'This is the sense of a 7-star...'

Distinguishing dark mages with modern magic was almost impossible, and even I couldn't do it without the fraudulent function of the direct-view glasses. But to sense it with just my senses... 'That's not the important part.'

I looked at Isaac. He was angrily arguing with Hong Si-hwa.

"So, you want to say that the Morf family deliberately didn't kill the beast and kept it sealed as a 'weapon of war'?"

"Yes, that's correct. According to our calculations, you had the ability to kill the beast long ago."

Ridiculous. The thousand-year-old beast, 'White Tiger Hwa-ryeong,' cannot be killed. It has nine lives and resurrects! Even the Great Morf barely managed to seal it, and for a thousand years, our family has guarded this place to prevent the beast from awakening. But a weapon of war? Ridiculous.

Isaac seemed genuinely angry at Hong Si-hwa. Although I hadn't spent much time with him, I had never seen him this furious.

"Ha, really... Do you all think the same and followed her here?"

Isaac Morf glanced at the mages representing the World Mage Organization and the various magic towers. They remained silent with stern expressions, indicating their agreement with Hong Si-hwa.

"This is crazy..."

Isaac rubbed his forehead and took off his glasses. The estimated rank, a legendary beast of 9-risk or higher, White Tiger Hwa-ryeong. It had overthrown numerous countries and killed many 8-class mages, who were extremely rare a thousand years ago, earning its reputation as a 'global threat.' The one who sealed it was his ancestor, the Great Morf. But even he couldn't find a way to kill Hwa-ryeong completely, so for generations, they sealed it and protected the world from the beast. And now, to hear such absurd accusations about using it as a weapon of war...

"You're making a wrong choice. Remember, if you awaken White Tiger Hwa-ryeong from its seal, you won't see a good outcome."

"We have thoroughly investigated White Tiger Hwa-ryeong and are fully prepared. You don't need to worry."

Confidence or arrogance. Isaac rubbed his forehead with his large hand, barely holding back a sigh. This was the first time he had encountered such a situation. How would his ancestors have dealt with this? If the Great Morf or even his wise father were alive... What would they have said?

'The situation is worse than I thought.'

Watching Isaac Morf's agony, I quietly left the command tent. The nerve-wracking tension was almost over, and the strategy meeting was about to begin. Since I wouldn't be participating in the actual battle, there was no need for me to attend the strategy meeting. Although it wouldn't hurt to listen, there was something I needed to confirm immediately.

'What are those dark mages planning to do here?'

Those cockroach-like beings that appear everywhere. I needed to figure out their intentions.

* * *

Flame and Angel. How much time had passed since the two girls lost consciousness? When they woke up and met each other's eyes, they couldn't help but scream.

"Ahhh!!"

"Ahhh!"

"Crazy girl, why are you screaming all of a sudden!"

"Ghost!"

"You're a ghost too!"

"Huh...?"

Seeing Flame's translucent body, Angel finally looked at her own body.

"Oh, really...?"

The two girls' bodies had turned translucent, looking like ghosts, which was quite creepy.

"This is... It seems we've successfully traveled to the past."

Flame said, looking at the large mansion in front of her with indifferent eyes. Angel, who finally noticed it, widened her eyes.

"Oh... In my memories. My lost home. It's now... vividly in front of me. This is not an illusion or a fake, but the real Morf mansion."

"Really... It is... 10 years ago. We've returned to that time."

"Are you okay?"

Flame asked cautiously as Angel stared blankly at the mansion for a long time. She smiled and replied.

"Of course! I won't waste this precious time being sentimental. Let's go."

"Where to?"

"Well, first..."

She hesitated and said.

"I want to find my father."

"Yes. I think that's a good idea."

It was a natural decision since they came to learn the truth about her father. As they headed towards the mansion, they noticed something unusual. It was Angel. The young Angel. She seemed anxious, looking around nervously, and then suddenly jumped over the fence and disappeared into the forest.

"Wait, that's a forbidden area...!"

Angel shouted in surprise, and Flame spoke in disbelief.

"Isn't that you as a child? You should remember."

"Well... maybe..."

She tried hard to recall her childhood, but how clearly can one remember events from when they were seven? Only important scenes would pass by like faint afterimages.

"Let's follow her for now!"

"Is that okay?"

"Yes! That's the Morf Forest. It's extremely dangerous and off-limits... Wait, hold on..."

As she spoke, something seemed to come to her mind, and Angel started thinking hard.

"Surely..."

"That kid is really fast."

Since they had become ghostly beings, they didn't need to walk or run, so Flame, who was now flying, quickly followed the young Angel. Angel seemed to be lost in thought, trying to remember something.

"Ahhh!"

"What the...?"

Hearing the young Angel's scream, they hurriedly flew over to find her being chased by a giant wolf monster.

"This is crazy!"

Flame instinctively pulled out her staff to use magic, but realized she had no mana in her body. She tried to tackle the wolf physically, but passed right through it.

"What is this...!"

She had never known that young Angel faced such danger. It wasn't recorded in the original story.

"This is really dangerous..."

"Wait. If my past self dies here, I wouldn't exist now, right?"

Finally, something seemed to click, and Angel spoke calmly.

"Yes. I remember something like this. The day I got lost in the forest and was chased by a terrifying wolf monster... that nightmare."

As the young Angel ran desperately, she tripped over a rock, and the wolf was about to pounce on her in a critical moment.

Suddenly!

"...He appeared. A mysterious hero wearing a shabby mask."

Even after ten years, she had never forgotten, but she didn't know his face or name. Her own masked hero. The man appeared, grabbed the wolf by the scruff of its neck with one hand, and subdued it. But...

"That... Isn't that...?"

"Isn't it just Baek Yuseol?"

Even with the mask, it was unmistakably Baek Yuseol.

"Really?"

What on earth was going on? Seeing a figure resembling Baek Yuseol suddenly appear in the past ten years ago, the girls were thrown into confusion.
