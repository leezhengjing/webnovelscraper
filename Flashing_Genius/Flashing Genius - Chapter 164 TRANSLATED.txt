## Chapter 164: The Curse of the Flower-Soaked (4)

To resolve the curse of the Flower-Soaked, the first step was to find Yan Hongchun San Yue. Honestly, I wasn't sure if this would be a fundamental solution. I had only met Yan Hongchun San Yue once, and even then, I was unconscious when I received the blessing, so I barely remembered it. 

In essence, I only knew that the root of my abilities was Yan Hongchun San Yue, but my knowledge was not much different from that of the Flower-Soaked.

"…It's been a while since I've been here."

The roots of the Celestial Spirit Tree, the space of the Divine Beasts. This place, created by Yan Hongchun San Yue for the Divine Beasts, was protected by the barrier of the World Tree and could never be opened without the permission of the High Elf Elder and the Elf King. Previously, a special situation allowed the intrusion of the Black Mage, but it was safe to say that this was the safest place in the world.

"Your Majesty, are you sure we don't need to accompany you?"

"Yes, it's fine. Please rest."

Only the Flower-Soaked and I would enter the space of the Divine Beasts. After entering, I planned to remove my mask, as exposing my face to other wizards could lead to a rampage similar to Orenha.

"Hoo… Shall we go in then?"

Seeing the Flower-Soaked looking somewhat tense pricked my conscience. If we failed here, it would be quite embarrassing… Still, I thought that Yan Hongchun San Yue, who bestowed the blessing, wouldn't be unable to take it back.

Whoosh!

The barrier opened, and as I stepped inside, the environment changed instantly. The cradle of the Celestial Spirit Tree, blessed by the World Tree, was cool even in midsummer, but the inside was a bit humid and hot. However, thanks to my body, which quickly adapted to the environment, I didn't think it would be particularly difficult.

"Let's go."

"…Yes."

Although the Flower-Soaked seemed tense, she quickly followed when I took the lead. Given that elves are known for their agility in forests, her pace would be faster in this jungle-like terrain. Of course, if I started using teleportation, the story would be different, but I didn't want to use it casually since it required precise calculations of distance and angle, which was quite a headache.

"You can take off your mask from here. There's no one around anyway."

"Is that okay…?"

She hesitated for a moment but soon took off her mask. There was no one around, and the Divine Beasts were not affected by her enchanting power.

"Haa…"

Even as she took off her mask, she held onto her dress tightly. It seemed she was very reluctant to expose her skin. Given the trauma accumulated over hundreds of years, it was understandable that she had developed a habit of covering herself up, and it wouldn't be resolved overnight.

"Do you feel refreshed?"

"Yes… Very much."

"That's a relief."

We walked straight ahead. Passing the first layer, we headed towards the 14th layer. Yan Hongchun San Yue's main body was located in the 15th layer, but no one could enter there, except perhaps another of the Twelve Celestial Beasts. So, we planned to meet Yan Hongchun San Yue's avatar in the 4th layer.

Previously, I had met Yan Hongchun San Yue too easily in the 4th layer, so some might misunderstand that they could meet him anywhere. However, the 4th layer was at least four times the size of Seoul. The reason I emphasized "at least" was that the area expanded according to Yan Hongchun San Yue's mood. Usually, it maintained an area six to seven times the size of Seoul, and sometimes it exceeded ten times when he was in a good mood.

Even though the map of the 4th layer was recorded in the Sparrow Glasses, I had asked Flame for the help of the "One-Wind Flower" because the area could stretch like a rubber band, and as long as we knew the direction, we could find our way.

In any case, it was practically impossible to meet Yan Hongchun San Yue by chance in such a place… but I moved forward without hesitation, crossing the 4th layer. Occasionally, high-ranking Divine Beasts threatened us, but most of them were repelled by the Flower-Soaked. She didn't use magic to defeat them; she just patted their foreheads a few times, and they happily went back. As expected of the Elf King, her affinity was extraordinary. Well, it was natural since she was the king of all fairies.

We walked in silence for a long time. Originally, it would have taken several nights to pass through, but thanks to our haste, we reached the 14th layer by the second night. It was a space filled with pink. Everything, from the light pouring from the sky to the plants growing on the ground, the soil, rocks, cliffs, and rivers, was dyed pink. It might seem romantic, but being there in person, I felt a kind of madness rather than romance. It felt like I would go crazy if I stayed in this pink space for too long.

"It's beautiful."

However, the Flower-Soaked seemed to like it, and her already beautiful expression became even more radiant. Seeing her like this, the atmosphere did become somewhat romantic. Her ability to change the mood with just her face was astonishing. Even before receiving Yan Hongchun San Yue's blessing, I was quite indifferent to women, but her smile almost took my breath away. Seeing her like this, I thought that even if the curse of the Flower-Soaked disappeared, many people would still suffer from lovesickness.

In the pink, vibrant atmosphere, we now had to find Yan Hongchun San Yue. Since the locations where he appeared randomly were all recorded in the glasses, we could find him within three days at the latest. However, contrary to my expectations, all the pink in front of us suddenly split to the sides, revealing another space.

As I stood there, dazed by the mysterious phenomenon of the space folding and unfolding, something appeared from within. It was a fox. Its ears were red, but its body was white, not matching the pink atmosphere, and it had a strange charm that captivated people despite being an animal.

The fox spoke to us directly.

"You have come, my children."

I bowed my head to show respect, but the Flower-Soaked couldn't do the same.

"Ah…"

She stared at the fox with a dazed expression. Yan Hongchun San Yue accepted her gaze and spoke in a bitter tone.

"You don't remember me, do you?"

When the Flower-Soaked nodded, guilt appeared on Yan Hongchun San Yue's face.

"I'm sorry. Because of me, you had to bear too many burdens. It was my greed. Because of my greed…"

We couldn't say anything to Yan Hongchun San Yue, who seemed to be blaming himself. When the Flower-Soaked shook her head with a confused expression, Yan Hongchun San Yue spoke cautiously.

"When I first saw you, you were very small and young. Yes, back then, the High Elf Elders must have pushed you into this place to test if you had the qualities of a king. Don't you remember?"

The Flower-Soaked shook her head, and Yan Hongchun San Yue spoke regretfully.

"The shock must have been great. As you know, this place is not easy for a child to enter."

Divine Beasts are pure. But is purity always good? No, absolutely not. If you haven't experienced 'pure malice,' you wouldn't understand. They purely make others suffer and feel pain. There were Divine Beasts of at least 4-star rank here, and I couldn't fathom the despair and fear the young Flower-Soaked must have felt encountering them.

"But I saw hope in you. I thought you might be able to revive the withering World Tree and provide us with a perfect home… such hope."

So, Yan Hongchun San Yue bestowed his blessing on the very young Flower-Soaked. However, having just created the space of the Divine Beasts, Yan Hongchun San Yue was exhausted and couldn't control his power properly, giving the Flower-Soaked an excessive blessing. After that, Yan Hongchun San Yue fell into a long sleep, and the Flower-Soaked had to live her life tormented by the curse, having lost all her memories. She could never show her face to the world again.

'Anyone who meets your eyes will die.'

'Your face is cursed.'

'Hide it.'

'Stay hidden.'

'Never come out for the rest of your life.'

The elves didn't need a political king to rule them. They just needed a bridge to communicate with the World Tree and convey its power and energy to them. So, the Flower-Soaked was pushed by the people to become the most noble and great being of the World Tree. Even now, she still dedicates herself to all the fairies of the World Tree without being able to show her face to the world. Despite no one recognizing her sacrifice, the Flower-Soaked endured and endured, hoping to be free someday.

"I made you live in hell."

In the end, all of this happened because of Yan Hongchun San Yue's greed. Because of that, one person's life was utterly ruined.

"Hate and resent me. I can't dare to say I'll lighten the burden on your heart."

The Flower-Soaked bit her lip and bowed her head. Strangely, her face was not filled with anger. Even though the person who had made her despair all her life was right in front of her. However, having lived her life hating herself, the Flower-Soaked no longer had the strength to resent anyone. She just… smiled bitterly.

"I'm fine."

Perhaps it was too painful to watch the Flower-Soaked, Yan Hongchun San Yue transformed into a human form and approached her barefoot, giving her a hug. The sight of two beautiful women hugging was so picturesque that it could be on the cover of a magazine, but it was time to resolve the issue.

Due to the effects of the Magic Leakage Syndrome, staying in a place filled with the energy of the Divine Beasts for too long was not good for my health.

"So, is there a solution?"

When I cautiously raised my hand and asked, Yan Hongchun San Yue slowly separated from the Flower-Soaked and nodded.

"It would be good to retrieve my power, but it is currently impossible. My main body is asleep, and I no longer have the power to give or retrieve blessings. My current form is just a shell, a materialized mental body."

Hearing this, the Flower-Soaked's expression became slightly gloomy, but Yan Hongchun San Yue's words were not finished.

"There is a way. It is possible to alleviate the blessing by transferring the power to another who has received my blessing."

Then, Yan Hongchun San Yue looked at me. We had anticipated this part, but we didn't know the method, so we came here. However, there was a slight problem with the method.

"You need to have a special 'communion.' For that, you need a sacred object, but it was lost outside, and we haven't found it yet."

"Communion…?"

"Yes. No matter how similar the blessings are, it is impossible to transfer them without any cost."

It was like creating a passage. Although the Flower-Soaked and I received the same blessing, she had the power to attract people's hearts, while I had the power to read their minds. To exchange these different natures, a passage was necessary, but the sacred object to help with that process was missing.

'What is that?'

I quickly searched with the Sparrow Glasses.

[Search: Flower-Soaked Sacred Object]
▼Search Records

But no matter what keywords I searched, nothing related appeared. A sacred object not recorded in the Sparrow Glasses…

'How did Flame resolve the curse in the game?'

I was about to search for that part separately when Yan Hongchun San Yue asked.

"Finding that object could be easy or very difficult. Do you have the confidence to find it?"

What else could I do? Whether it was recorded in the glasses or not, I had decided to save the Flower-Soaked and had come this far, so I had to see it through to the end.

"Yes, I have to find it."

I nodded without hesitation, and Yan Hongchun San Yue finally smiled faintly. 

Something felt uneasy… but it should be fine, right?
