# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy's Front Flash

## Chapter 141: Summer Vacation (5)

In the world of Aether, there existed three full moons. When the full moon rose periodically, mana would fill the earth abundantly, and this day was often called the "Day of the Magician." The reason for this had long been known through magic: the first magician borrowed the power of mana from the starlight and moonlight of the sky.

"Tomorrow evening, the full moon of Shalie will rise."

Among the three moons, Shalie was the largest and most powerful. Although it was a pity that all three moons would not be full like last time, there would be no problem as three people were attempting to connect to the Constellation Project.

They had to reach the Moonlight Temple in the Kallansar Canyon by the next evening, but that was not a significant issue. The monsters along the way were at most level 3 risk, so they posed no threat to them.

However, it was a bit disappointing.

"Ah, the world is so vast."

Flame stretched and walked barefoot on the white sandy beach of the Laplati Coast. Since there were no people at all, only three girls were on this vast coastline.

"...If we wait a bit, the boat to take us will come."

Hong Biyeon frowned as Flame splashed water with her feet.

"We still have some time left. Let's enjoy a bit of leisure."

They were not here for fun. Although all three liked the sea, they had no regrets about staying long. There was nothing as pleasant as diving into the emerald sea.

But no one expressed dissatisfaction. They just quietly stared at the horizon.

"...Ah, right. Originally, field trips like this need evidence."

Flame took something out of her bag and quickly set up a tripod. Then she installed a camera on it and called Angel and Hong Biyeon.

"Hey, you two, stop fooling around and come over here."

"Huh? What..."

"We don't have time for that."

"You're just standing there doing nothing, right?"

"Hurry up, come on!"

Flame forcibly dragged them to stand on either side of her, with the blue sea as their backdrop. They were dressed lightly, pretending to be travelers just before departure. It was enough for a commemorative photo.

"I know this isn't why we came here. But, it's never strange to leave a photo anywhere, anytime. It's all memories. It's life experience, so remember it."

Although it was advice from the youngest-looking Flame, it carried a weight that made Angel and Hong Biyeon unable to say anything.

"Alright, I'm taking it now. One, two, three! Click!"

A burst of light. A memory captured forever.

Breaking through the Kallansar Canyon itself was not that difficult. In fact, this place was a famous spot for treasure hunters about 20-30 years ago because the "Moonlight Temple" was discovered here, revealing treasures of astronomical value to the world.

It was soon handed over to a museum, and many treasure hunters flocked to Kallansar Canyon in hopes of striking it rich. But that was a story of the past. No one found any more treasures, and the Kallansar boom quickly died down.

Thanks to that, a perfect map was created, allowing Flame and her party to traverse the canyon quite comfortably. The three climbed the mountain in silence. They had been consistently training their basic physical strength, so climbing the mountain was not a problem.

However, the monsters that attacked intelligently from time to time were an issue. Just because they were level 3 risk didn't mean they could be ignored. Intelligent creatures used tools to hunt the strong with weak power, much like how ancient ancestors hunted mammoths with stone spears.

Spending a night was not a problem either. Whether princess or commoner girl, they all took turns standing watch for three hours and slept in sleeping bags.

Thus, the next evening arrived.

"We've arrived."

The three girls finally reached the Moonlight Temple. The very temple that had driven countless treasure hunters into Kallansar Canyon 30 years ago. It was said that the mysterious staff "Enelina Moonlight" discovered there contained the power of moonlight.

However, the temple itself was desolate. It was as large as a decent-sized playground but was nothing more than a crumbling ruin, with only the altar at the end of the stairs remaining.

"There it is."

As they stepped, stone dust fell, and the creaking stairs felt unstable. The girls climbed to the altar and took positions in a triangular formation. Angel carefully raised both hands and sent the "Fragment of Constellation" to the center. She had already been thoroughly instructed by Arain on how to use it. Mistakes were not allowed. This was the last remaining fragment in the world.

"Are you all ready?"

After confirming that Flame and Hong Biyeon nodded, Angel took a deep breath with a determined expression. Closing her eyes, she focused her mind on the Fragment of Constellation. Slowly... slowly...

The sky began to spin rapidly. It felt like watching stars move quickly in a time-lapse video. It was an illusion.

"Are the stars... rotating backward?"

At that moment, the three girls found themselves walking in a vast sea of starlight. As Flame and Hong Biyeon tried to step back in a daze, Angel hurriedly gestured for them to come to the center. Understanding the signal, they approached and held each other's hands.

"Is this... working?"

"...Yes."

Finally, they began to communicate. Hong Biyeon turned her head to look at the starlight filling this world. Each one of those stars recorded the information of the world.

"Is this really the Constellation Project...?"

There was no time for sentiment. Angel hurriedly shouted into the void.

"Show us the end of the world."

Whoosh!

"Ugh!"

"Wait..."

However, as if rejecting them, the vast sea of stars created a massive wave, as if trying to swallow them in a tide of information. As Hong Biyeon looked at Angel with a face asking what was going on, Angel hurriedly repeated the same request she had made last time.

"Show us all of Baek Yuseol's past!"

Suddenly, miraculously, the wave that seemed about to engulf the world sank to the ground.

Boom!

A giant black dragon appeared. A world that had perished. Red meteors filled the sky, striking the already dead land, and amidst it all, the black dragon silently watched the collapsed world.

"This, this is..."

"Focus! That's just an illusion!"

As Flame seemed to waver, Angel shouted.

"...I know. I know, but... what is that?"

Such questions arose in her mind. The scene undoubtedly showed the end of the world. However... such a monster had never appeared in the original story. It was only mentioned that the world was engulfed by the other side, so why did such a monster appear? She couldn't understand it at all.

"That person is..."

In the world where everyone had died, Hong Biyeon found someone. A man in armor that seemed to hold the moonlight. It was the future Baek Yuseol. As he walked alone towards the black dragon, Angel spoke.

"That... was the last scene I saw last time."

Back then, she couldn't see any further due to a lack of mana. But now, it should be possible.

"Show us more of the past!"

What happened after that? What exactly occurred? The world brightened, and suddenly, countless worlds unfolded in all directions.

"Huh...?"

No one could speak. In the countless worlds that filled the sky, there was Baek Yuseol in each one. Each one was a different version of Baek Yuseol. In one world, Baek Yuseol was sitting quietly. In another, he was pierced by a spear and dead. In yet another, he was hunting a monster the size of a house.

Countless Baek Yuseols in countless worlds. It wasn't a parallel universe; it was all the same Baek Yuseol.

"...Ah."

Understanding the situation completely, Flame collapsed to the ground. Look over there. Baek Yuseol was pierced by a monster's claw and died. But in the next moment, he stood up somewhere else and moved forward again.

Death. And then, regression. She knew that Baek Yuseol existed by reversing time. However... there was one thing she hadn't considered.

"How many times has Baek Yuseol regressed?"

She naturally thought he had only reversed time once. The curse of the Silver Eleven Moon... was such. Even a single regression erased his existence from the world. But Baek Yuseol had regressed tens, hundreds, thousands, no, tens of thousands of times. Dying, reviving, challenging, being forgotten, dying, running again, being forgotten, and challenging again.

"This is... unbelievable."

Angel and Hong Biyeon, too, couldn't maintain their sanity as they watched Baek Yuseol's endless deaths and challenges. Angel, covering her mouth with both hands, spoke in a trembling voice.

"How many... deaths has he experienced?"

She couldn't finish her sentence. Flame stared blankly at one of the Baek Yuseols. There was Baek Yuseol, standing on the summit after hunting the guardian at the place buried at the end of the continent, facing the "Soft Bean Forest April" with the sunset behind him. There was Baek Yuseol, reaching the legendary place known to be lost in the depths of the "Alamanka Abyss," finally facing the "Red Summer June." There was Baek Yuseol, standing on the frozen whirlpool of "Atlantis Vortex," the largest whirlpool since the world's creation, facing the "Blue Winter December."

"The Twelve Zodiac..."

Flame vaguely knew of their existence. They were mentioned as legends in the original story. For some reason, Baek Yuseol was desperately searching for the Twelve Zodiac in different timelines and worlds. Those beings, now only left as legends, he was determined to find them.

This was not the future. It was a story of the past.

"Why...?"

Thump! As she felt a sharp pain in her chest, the countless worlds began to fold. They had reached the limit of the knowledge they could access.

"No!"

One by one, they began to disappear into the starlight. Angel desperately squeezed out her mana. The last question allowed to the girls.

"To save Baek Yuseol... no, to save the world, tell us what we must do...!"

However, the library of stars did not stop folding the worlds, as if it didn't hear her. Was there no more knowledge allowed to them? As she thought so, one world remained unfolded. The scene they first witnessed... the end of the world where Baek Yuseol faced the black dragon.

"Huh...?"

But something was strange. Unlike before, the black dragon was bleeding and lying on the ground. "Did he... hunt the black dragon...?"

As they watched the unbelievable scene, they met Baek Yuseol's eyes as he turned his head. Chills ran down their spines. Standing on the black dragon's corpse, wiping the blood from his moonlight sword, his eyes held no emotion, almost stopping their hearts.

That was... the appearance of Baek Yuseol who had reached the very end. After tens of thousands of regressions, having lost all emotions, he stared blankly into the void. Instinctively, they followed Baek Yuseol's gaze.

A sea of corpses and blood. Corpses formed mountains, flowing blood formed rivers, and all the civilizations built by humans over thousands of years had perished. Even the three moons that formed the world's foundation had fallen to the ground.

...Suddenly, Baek Yuseol's figure disappeared. The reason... they could guess without saying it out loud. After tens of thousands of regressions, he killed the black dragon, but nothing remained.

"This life is a failure."

So, he decided to turn back time again. He thought so and moved somewhere to repeat the world once more.

"Ah..."

Angel exhaled a deep breath, feeling empty. Despite all the effort, nothing remained. Perhaps, in this world, they had all already died. Baek Yuseol didn't want that. Although memories and recollections were like a tangled thread to him, he continued without abandoning his belief. For a more perfect world, towards an ending where everyone could survive, he continued to run, even now.

Whoosh...!

The wind blew. ...A world where nothing remained. The disaster that brought the end of the world was hunted, and even the one who caused it left. As they wondered why this world was still being shown, twelve bright stars extended from the black dragon's corpse and disappeared into the sky.

"What, what...!"

"Constellations...?"

What were they showing them? Before they could find the answer, the last world that had perished also melted into the sea of starlight. Immediately after, all three girls lost consciousness and collapsed.
