# I Became a Genius in the Magic School's Frontline Teleportation

## Chapter 149: Magic Survival (1)

Even after Baek Yuseol left, Jelly El sat there for a long time, unable to move as if nailed to the spot. Even with her cynical gaze, it was hard to face the current situation properly. However, time continued to pass.

'...I need to prepare for the next schedule.'

She forced herself to stand up, putting strength into her trembling legs. Although a huge hole had been pierced in her always-calm heart, she knew well that she couldn't afford to sit down and do nothing if she wanted to move forward.

'I should have listened to my father's words... The Oath of Magic is absolute. But it was also an oath that should never be taken lightly. Before becoming a wizard, one is usually first educated by their parents. -Think of the Oath of Magic as staking your life. For this reason, it was considered impolite in the magical society to carelessly present the Oath of Magic to someone else. Unless the other party was a notorious criminal, that is.'

'Was this matter really worth staking my life on?'

...If she had to answer, it was. She had thought she would rather bite her tongue than let her father know of her disgraceful failure. But what was the result? She ended up being bound by the oath, and for at least three years... she wouldn't be able to see her father. That was the most terrible torture for Jelly El. Each day would feel like a nightmare. She had to find a way to cure her father's 'incurable disease' as soon as possible, but she couldn't even see him.

'Ah...'

Her legs gave out, and she reached for the table. The heavy and rough sensation was felt through her palm. Upon checking, she found a stone-like object placed on the table. It was a gift left by Baek Yuseol. The item of that Baek Yuseol, whom she wanted to tear apart. She had no intention of taking it, but she had no choice. She was currently in a position where she had to listen to him. Jelly El, who reluctantly pocketed the stone, staggered back to her waiting room. Her back looked pitiful, but... there was nothing in this world that could comfort her.

The interior of the Stella Dome was composed of various systematic structures, and the paths were so complex that first-time visitors often got lost even with a map. Fortunately, the black magician using the name 'Kavaren' didn't seem to have that problem. Anella followed him through the intricately twisted interior of the Stella Dome for quite a while.

"Haha! It's a bit complicated, right? Stella is originally like this, so just follow me well. Ah, don't worry, don't worry! I have memorized all the paths here!"

"By the way, what status did you come in with? The manager's area isn't a place just anyone can enter, but you're wearing a school uniform? You didn't come in with some trivial role like a part-time job, did you? Puhaha! No, that's not it! With such a status, the tasks you can do are limited. Right? Right, right?"

"Shut up."

He had an unusually talkative side, seeming unable to keep anything that came to his mind from coming out of his mouth. From Anella's perspective, it was a personality she didn't like. Even if he wasn't a black magician, she wouldn't want to associate with such a personality. Kavaren, chattering noisily, guided Anella somewhere. Initially, it was thanks to Baek Yuseol's help that she could enter the manager's area of the Stella Dome. She had come in as 'a friend's participant,' so Anella's activity area was limited, but Kavaren roamed freely, swiping his name tag card on sensors.

'Is Stella's security really this lax...?'

It made her realize anew how great and dangerous the black magic technique developed by the leader of the Moon Shadow Sect was. It meant that such black magicians were infiltrating various places in the magical world. Perhaps... if this continued, the black magicians might really take over the world. She shook her head to dispel the thought.

'I will return to being human.'

Black magicians ruling the world? The moment those impulsive, endlessly selfish beings, driven by momentary desires and drunk on power, ruled the world, it would be the end. Although she was currently a black magician, she didn't want such a world. Even if a world ruled by power came... with her weak power, she would just be prey.

"Here we are!"

After walking for a while, Kavaren entered a high-authority restricted area within the Stella Dome.

"This is...?"

At the end of the corridor was a large room. This circular space was filled with magic circles, and numerous researchers were busily moving around, controlling them.

"You haven't been here before, right? This is the 'System Control Room' that handles all phenomena in the Stella Dome. There seem to be about six more such rooms within the Stella Dome, but that's not important."

Indeed, the important fact was...

'A black magician has reached the core place that controls the Stella Dome, a symbol of Stella Academy.'

'How...'

Anella took a step back. No matter how she thought about it, it didn't make sense that they could enter this easily. This must be a trap. Otherwise, it didn't make sense.

'Is Stella's security... this lax?'

It felt as if they had been deliberately allowed in... but why? She tried to think of who might be infiltrating Stella Academy and who might be occupying the upper echelons, but as a mere subordinate, Anella didn't have much information. The gap in information. The unbelievable phenomenon that crept in through the gap of ignorance brought an unknown fear to Anella. Quietly, slowly, surely. As if it would swallow her whole.

"Whoa, there's no need to be so scared."

Kavaren, understanding her reaction, chuckled and walked forward.

"Wait."

"This is a restricted area."

Researchers in white coats and magic knights in black robes stepped forward to stop him, but Kavaren confidently presented his name tag, pretending to be a normal person.

"Didn't you receive the message? I came at the request of the vice principal. Some adjustments are needed for the magic circles in the control room. Here, this is a handwritten entry permit."

"Ah... I see."

Seeing the entry permit, whether real or forged, the magic knights nodded and allowed entry.

"And the student behind...?"

"She's a student I'm keeping an eye on. She wanted to see the magic of the Stella Dome."

"Hmm, please make sure the student doesn't touch the magic circles."

"Of course."

After all, it was the Stella Dome. Even if a few magic circles were tampered with, the system wouldn't suddenly go down, so allowing a student in at the request of someone sent by the vice principal wasn't a big deal.

...Thus, Kavaren safely entered the system control room and looked back at Anella.

"See? For the Moon Shadow Sect, something like this is very easy."

Only then did Anella realize why he had brought her here. A display of power and authority. She knew that there were subtle conflicts among the black magician factions, but as a subordinate, she had never experienced it directly. Given the situation, she was mistaken for a high-ranking black magician, and the other party had come to show off to her.

'We can do this. What can you do?'

Realizing his intention belatedly, Anella felt quite disgusted, but unfortunately, there was nothing she could show.

"Ah, of course, this isn't what I wanted to show you."

"...What?"

"Do you know? The Stella Dome is half a fictional space. In other words, it's very similar to the other world."

So what?

Kavaren raised the corners of his mouth and approached a nearby magic circle.

"These magic circles... are very finely operated, so even if we tamper with them a bit, not much will change. As expected, it's the principal's magic. Amazing. Truly amazing."

But.

"If we, as black magicians... exploit the gaps in the system, we can cause a 'bug.'"

Finding a gap in the magic of a typical 9th-class magician was practically impossible. However, the case was special. The other world was the domain of black magicians. Even Eltman Eltwin, known as the authority on spatial magic, couldn't completely conquer the other world. Therefore, if a black magician with excellent magical skills intervened, it was possible to make 'a very slight interference' in Eltman Eltwin's perfect magic. Just like when the 'real Persona Gate' appeared during the first-year students' Persona Gate practice...

"What kind of small prank should we play this time? Drumroll~"

Kavaren said playfully and winked at Anella.

"Actually, I've already done it."

"...What?"

"The Magic Survival held in the Stella Dome... You can't actually harm each other, right? Isn't that so?"

Therefore, participants could attack each other sincerely without worry and not be afraid of the opponent's attacks. But, just in case...

"What if one of them! If there was a black magician who could actually kill the opponent... what would happen?"

"...What?"

"Wouldn't the survival become more thrilling? Exciting? Doesn't your heart race? Ah, I'm so excited I could go crazy. Ahhh..."

'Damn it!'

Leaving behind Kavaren, who was stomping his feet with an ecstatic expression, Anella quickly left the control room. She had to inform Baek Yuseol of this fact as soon as possible. Then, a thought occurred to her.

'Wait, in the Magic Survival...'

Baek Yuseol must be participating too?

* * *

-Participants, please move to your designated positions.

At the voice of a woman echoing in the air, I stepped onto the platform. Looking to my sides, I saw elites from various schools lined up. Truly genius-like, seeing them in their unique outfits made me realize that this world was originally a game.

'Hmm...'

Activating the telescope function of my glasses, I looked at a distant place. I spotted Jelly El staring blankly into the air with a half-dead expression.

'She'll be fine...'

Knowing that the fundamental reason she had to become a villain was because of her father, Melian, I had no choice but to take such extreme measures. Due to the Oath of Magic, Jelly El couldn't retaliate against me. It would be great if she could give up on her father, but... it wouldn't be easy.

'I hope she meets a good person and falls in love.'

I don't see much chance of that happening. In the original game, Jelly El either walked the path of destruction while looking only at her father or destroyed the protagonist. There were only those two choices.

-Soon, we will move to the ground.

As the voice indicating the start of the match echoed, the participants began to warm up. I was also lightly stretching when a commotion arose from behind.

'Wait, I have something to tell you...!'

'Student! Step back! The match is about to start...'

'Please! Just let me say one thing...'

What is it? Narrowing my eyes and maximizing the zoom function of my glasses, I faintly caught sight of Anella's face. However, the distance was too far, and there was a barrier, so I couldn't hear her voice properly.

'Isn't she supposed to stay out of sight?'

Why is she causing such a commotion? At that moment, a warning message floated in the air.

Ding!

[The 'School Competition' has been promoted to a main episode.]

'What...?' 

It was an unexpected message, so I couldn't help but be flustered.

'No, suddenly?'

I hurriedly searched my glasses to find out what was going on.

[Sometimes, this happens.]

[An event where a black magician intrudes and causes chaos.]

[Why is it promoted to a main episode even though it's not? I don't know. Go ask the game company.]

[I also died once when a meteor fell from the sky during a Mayu Castle date event. It's annoying.]

Only then did I realize that such cases occasionally happened in the original game. Although it had never happened to me, there were indeed posts about it in the user community. Usually, events were just a brief healing part without any incidents. However, very rarely... an event would escalate into an episode due to an incident.

A probability as rare as lightning striking a persimmon tree consecutively. A situation created by a complex combination of numerous choices. Such a rare episode had fallen upon me. As the strategy guide unfolded before my eyes, a strange sensation enveloped my entire body. Feeling as if my body was being transported somewhere, the world turned upside down.

-The match has begun.
