### Chapter 184: Isolation (2)

The dark mages do not train. They grow rapidly through real combat experience and the absorption of blood through slaughter. In the world of dark mages, this is considered perfectly natural. In this sense, Mayuseong could be considered quite an oddity.

"Is he training right now? What a disgusting bastard."

"Typical of an inferior half-blood, his actions are just as lowly."

"I find it rather amusing."

This place, known as the Black Castle, was built on a cliff where the Black Wind blows. It was not a place just anyone could enter. Even among the dark mages, who had a vague hierarchy, only the highest-ranking individuals, those close to being 'nobles,' could set foot in the Black Castle. Most of the residents of the Black Castle were either the highest-ranking dark mages who had inherited power and blood from the Dark Mage King or his children.

As a child of the Dark Mage King, Mayuseong was considered one of the highest-ranking dark mages in the Black Castle. However, he was a half-blood. A half-blood between a dark mage and a human. The act of distinguishing this was laughable because there was no such thing as a 'pure dark mage' to begin with. Elves, dwarves, humans, and various other races had to abandon their souls to the underworld to become what was called a dark mage.

However, this might be why they ostracized Mayuseong. To those who had abandoned their own race to become dark mages, Mayuseong, who was neither fully human nor fully dark mage, was nothing but a dirty mixed-blood. Moreover, the fact that such a mixed-blood was engaging in the lowly act of training was not something they could look upon kindly.

"How laughable. No matter how much he trains, he will never possess true black mana. He shouldn't expect any kind looks from his 'siblings.'"

Meditating in place, training his mana, simulating battles against imaginary enemies, increasing his focus to cast spells faster, and even studying various tactics and magicâ€”his actions were highly respectable as a mage. However, to the dark mages, it was nothing but a repulsive struggle. They felt a sense of superiority, thinking that he was doing such lowly things because he couldn't possess the same power as them.

However, there was one thing his 'siblings' didn't know. Mayuseong's potential had already far surpassed theirs, and the reason he was training was to erase the black mana. Black mana was something Mayuseong couldn't control. When his stamina was exhausted, it would be released and go berserk. At that moment, Mayuseong would lose all his emotions, and he hated that feeling immensely.

Boom!!

Mayuseong, who had half-destroyed one side of the castle wall with a giant fireball, wiped his sweat and looked up. His eyes met those of his siblings. With a friendly smile, he spoke to his siblings, who were looking at him with disgust.

"Brothers, would you like to come down and have a sparring match?"

However,

"Ahem, I will pass."

"I don't want to mix hands with a half-blood."

"Are you avoiding it out of fear?"

"No, I'm avoiding it because it's dirty."

His siblings avoided sparring with him. Indeed, Mayuseong was weak. However, if he were to enter a 'berserk' state, his true nature and abilities, inherited deeply from the Dark Mage King, would emerge, and no one present could stop him. In a normal sparring match, his siblings would undoubtedly win, but if they were to lose to a half-blood, it would be a lifelong disgrace, so they didn't bother to engage with him.

Mayuseong watched them quietly and then picked up his wand again. It was a tool that dark mages didn't use, and only mages did, which made it even more precious to him. However, he could no longer continue his training.

"My son."

The sudden appearance of the Dark Mage King was the reason. He looked at the wall Mayuseong had destroyed and, as if it didn't matter, turned his gaze away and spoke.

"Return to Stella."

"You told me to stay until the end of summer vacation."

The Dark Mage King spoke indifferently. Mayuseong stared at him. Neither father nor son was smiling. The Dark Mage King didn't feel Mayuseong's gaze. The eyes that looked at him held no emotion, yet they resembled 'her' eyes so much. It was both resentful and grateful that he was born with eyes resembling hers, as there was no trace of her left in this world.

"That's right. The schedule has changed."

"May I ask the reason?"

"You don't need to know."

The conversation ended there. The Dark Mage King, deciding there was no need to spend more time, turned away. 'There's no need to keep him here any longer.' Though it was said that no child is without pain when bitten, it was different for the Dark Mage King. He loved Mayuseong more than anyone else. The problem was that his way of showing it was entirely different from that of humans.

He knew that Mayuseong was not being treated well in the Black Castle. Nevertheless, the reason he called his son was that the 'fragmented soul' he had hidden in Stella was about to awaken. The fragmented soul was a part of him, but it had created another self with memories from fifty years ago. In other words, the 'other me' would not recognize his son. Fearing that the 'other me' would harm his son, the Dark Mage King called Mayuseong to the castle, and it turned out to be a very wise decision. The news of the horrors that occurred in Stella had reached even this place, thousands of kilometers away.

'But... I failed.'

Knowing that the child of the stars would be born and enter Stella, he had prepared in his own way, but it ended in failure. He thought the plan was perfect, but there must have been some variable. Or perhaps it was arrogant to think that his plan would work on the child of the stars.

The Black Castle, the Tower of Darkness. Standing at the highest point of the cliff of screams, the Dark Mage King looked up. The Milky Way in the night sky sparkled as if it would pour down, but it looked precarious, like a candle that could go out at any moment.

'As my master's prophecy said... is the world heading towards its end?'

It was a very special generation. The descendants of the twelve disciples of the first mage had begun to bloom with 'blessings,' and the child of the stars had been born.

'At most... ten years is the limit.'

He doubted whether he would even be alive by then, but his son would surely face that day. Hoping that the future his son would face would be peaceful, the Dark Mage King quietly closed his eyes. Then, the constellations would no longer be visible.

* * *

When one thinks of the palace of the Adolevit royal family, one usually imagines a grand and magnificent castle. But reality was different. The fortress built on a cold, sheer cliff was more like a fortress than a palace, with cold winds blowing all year round, making it feel like winter every day.

Arriving in the capital of the Adolevit Kingdom, 'Tehalan,' Hong Biyeon felt the unseasonably cold temperature as she traveled by carriage. The flame mage Adolevit, one of the twelve disciples of the first mage, had settled in the harsh and cold northern region and established the Adolevit royal family. Why she made such a choice remains a mystery to this day.

"Princess, we have arrived."

At the words of her personal guard knight, Yetelin, Princess Hong Biyeon nodded. She looked up at the grand palace before her. The Frostcliff Palace, a place as cold as its name, was her birthplace and cradle.

"Princess, are you ready?"

"Do I need to be ready to return home?"

"Indeed... that's fortunate."

There was no one to trust in the royal palace. At most, she could trust a few retainers she had personally taken in, including Yetelin. Even the hundreds of knights escorting her carriage were not her people. She couldn't breathe easily, fearing they might point their staffs at her at any moment.

'Get a grip.'

She closed her eyes and cooled her head. She must never show weakness in the Frost Palace. She had to be stronger than anyone else. As she steeled her resolve, the carriage crossed the only bridge connecting the cliff and the palace, the 'Path of the Sun,' and finally arrived at the Frost Palace.

Without a moment's rest, she entered the 'Red Hall' to meet the king according to protocol.

"Princess Hong Biyeon greets the great face of the sun."

Boom!

As the drums announced the princess's entrance, the towering doors opened, revealing the overwhelming scale of the hall. And at the end of it stood a woman with pinkish-red hair and the reddest eyes of anyone.

The queen, 'Hong Seryu Adolevit.'

Hong Biyeon walked along the red carpet. With each step towards the queen, her heartbeat gradually calmed. The queen's gaze was hot and painful. Was it because she was a great 8th-class mage who could burn a person to ashes with just her eyes, or was it because she hated her?

She didn't know the reason, but she understood one thing.

'You still hate me.'

Being hated by the queen was like having a huge wall in her path, but she didn't mind. The queen had a valid reason to resent her.

"You've come."

Princess Hong Biyeon knelt before Queen Hong Seryu and bowed her head. Without permission, she couldn't dare look at the sun.

"You may rise."

Hong Biyeon lifted her head and met the queen's eyes. The gaze was not pleasant. Did such a person call her back to the palace out of concern? Ridiculous.

"So, have you been well?"

"Thanks to the sun's generous care, I have enjoyed peace and well-being."

"Your words are smooth."

Hong Seryu rested her chin on her hand, clearly showing that this time was a bother.

"Though you are not my biological child, since my daughter loved you, I tried to love you as well."

Hong Biyeon bowed her head.

"But you reject my love. May I ask why?"

Why indeed. Did Hong Biyeon have to say it herself? It was obvious.

'Because you hate me.'

The queen's biological daughter and first princess, Hong Erin. After her death, the sun was enraged. Though her death was inevitable, the queen sought a cause. No, she created someone to hate. Coincidentally, Hong Biyeon resembled the deceased Hong Erin too much. With silver hair like moonlight and burning red eyes, her beautiful appearance, overwhelming talent in flames, and even her lovely personality that made everyone adore her.

But why?

'Why did my daughter have to die?'

The queen asked the princess.

"Do you think of that child?"

"...Yes."

"I see. Never forget her."

Only then could Hong Biyeon lift her head. It wasn't because she felt relieved. Rather, the anxiety she had felt became a reality, making her unable to do anything.

"I called you back to the palace because I wanted to love you. Since you are living in place of my daughter, you must not die in some foolish place."

"So stay in the palace until things calm down."

"...Understood."

"How about taking a vacation together since the weather is hot?"

"A vacation... you say?"

"Yes, the coast of Levian would be nice. It should be cool there."

"...Thank you for your grace."

"Is there anything to thank? I will also rest. The conversation is over, so you may leave."

Hong Biyeon stood up and left the Red Hall. Even then, she was not in her right mind. Dizziness clouded her head, and she couldn't remember if she walked straight or staggered. Though she had expected it, the reality of what she didn't want to think about hit her hard, leaving her unable to do anything.

'The coast of Levian...'

The eternal winter sea. For the royal family, it was no different from a place of exile. She felt a crushing sense of despair but clenched her fists to hold back her tears. Blood oozed from her palms as her nails dug in, but she felt no pain.

It was now certain. The queen had no intention of making her the king. Moreover, she would be locked in a cage for the rest of her life, never to be let out until she burned out and died. A bitter laugh escaped her lips. She had expected to be confined to the Frost Palace, but she hadn't expected such an extreme measure.

It was a terrible feeling. Why was she so powerless?

"Sigh..."

She walked along the 'Wall of Frost.' It was a place she used to walk with her sister, Hong Erin, whenever she was stressed. Looking at the blooming flower garden below used to be the best thing, but now there were no flowers in bloom. She walked and walked endlessly. When she was about to collapse from exhaustion, she sat on the wall and looked down at the capital of Adolevit, Tehalan.

It was evening, and the streets were bustling with people. It was impossible to see each person's face, but for some reason, one person stood out clearly. The reason she could see him was simple. While everyone else was moving busily, he stood still, looking this way from the top of a tall building.

'Oh...?'

She couldn't be sure who it was because it was too far, but just as she thought he resembled someone, the figure disappeared. She stood up in a hurry and looked around, but with her limited human vision, it was impossible to see that far.

"...What am I doing?"

Someone came to mind, but it couldn't be. There was no reason for him to come here. Thinking she was having a futile delusion because she was pushed to her limit, she turned her head. It seemed like it would be a very long night.
