### Chapter 259: The Noble Soul (9)

The orchard of Namuhwaran was incredibly vast. In this expansive place, even a 9th-class mage like Aryumun would find it difficult to easily pinpoint Cheoliban's location using search magic. Knowing this, Cheoliban decided to stay in Namuhwaran's orchard for a few more days. It wasn't because he suddenly wanted to settle in this place. The paths out of Namuhwaran's orchard were tightly blocked by the Magic Department's magic warriors and the Black Magic Extermination Squad.

He could kill a few and create a gap to escape, but he preferred to avoid unnecessary killing. 

"This is so annoying..."

As someone loved by the earth, Cheoliban could repel most detection magic with anti-magic. However, with an expert like Aryumun on the move, it was only a matter of time before he was discovered. Aryumun was a weak human with limited magic power, so Cheoliban planned to wait quietly until Aryumun's detection abilities weakened.

Life, or rather, his magical life, wasn't going to be that easy.

"Traitor. So, you were here."

Cheoliban sighed inwardly as he looked at the men in black robes blocking his way. Black mages were much more sensitive to black magic than regular mages. Especially these men, who were part of the 'Black Cloud Group,' considered top predators even within the Black Magic Union. They were ridiculous fellows who took pride in being black mages and had heightened their detection abilities to personally deal with traitors.

Their combat abilities were also exceptional, combining various bloodline traits and special abilities, making them a real headache to deal with.

Why were they a headache?

"Because it's annoying to deal with them quietly..."

The stronger the opponent, the harder it is to subdue them without making noise. Even for Cheoliban, it was impossible to deal with the Black Cloud Group silently.

"Ah... right. Hey, you guys. Let me ask you one thing."

Despite Cheoliban's words, the black mages of the Cloud Group began to reveal their claws imbued with black magic or bared their fangs, emitting hostility. Amidst this, he firmly asked his question.

"Have you seen a black mage named 'Soya'? He should be hiding somewhere around here."

"...Did you just say Soya?"

The name made even the black mages, who seemed unwilling to answer, open their mouths. Black mage Soya.

"That's not a name someone like you can mention."

"Yeah, I figured."

It made sense. Unlike him, Soya was currently treated as a god-like figure among black mages. His greatest achievements included burning an entire World Tree and killing a divine spirit to steal its heart.

"What's so great about that?"

While divine spirits were the most feared beings for black mages, to Cheoliban, it seemed like a child's play with a medal attached.

"So, you don't know?"

They didn't answer, and realizing his question was in vain, Cheoliban scratched his head and sighed deeply. Then the leader shouted loudly.

"He has given up. Take him down!"

The black magic spread rapidly throughout the World Tree, and bloodline magic, which only a few black mages could use, was simultaneously unleashed.

In the midst of this...

"...The weather is really nice."

Cheoliban looked up at the sky. The sun was shining brightly, the sky was clear, and the clouds were floating gently. On such a peaceful day, having to engage in a bothersome fight was tiresome. He was sick of it all.

* * *

"We need to search the roots of the World Tree."

At Aryumun Blushun's words, Elder Suhaksan and the elves of Namuhwaran's Elder Council hardened their expressions. Such words should not be spoken lightly. To dare to search the roots, the heart of the World Tree, was unthinkable.

"It's unavoidable. If we spread mana from the roots throughout the World Tree, we can immediately locate him. You understand the danger of the situation, don't you?"

"That and this are separate matters. Even if he attacks the World Tree, it would be less dangerous than showing you the roots."

"Haa... really."

Aryumun understood well how insulting it was to them to suggest searching the roots of the World Tree. But what could he do? He was a scholar who pursued efficiency. Instead of wasting time here, it would be better to just swallow their pride and show the roots. He couldn't understand the elves, who were so stubborn. No wonder they had no great mages in their history.

Aryumun pondered for a moment. He had to make a rational decision. Was it right to forcibly break their pride and examine the roots?

"I have to."

If he missed Cheoliban here, all efforts would be in vain.

"I'm sorry, but we can't afford to protect your pride. Cheoliban is classified as a 'Grade 1 Dangerous Entity' by the International Mage Covenant. Even royalty cannot refuse to search for such a target, right?"

"That is..."

Most existing races were bound by a grand covenant, treaty, or agreement under the umbrella of 'magic.' Some races made a covenant, others a treaty, but they all created a grand promise, which was the 'Principle of Black Mage Investigation' and its regulations. Black mages were the common evil of society, so mages agreed not to interfere with each other using magic, except for black mages.

The law for hunting black mages was a law that bound all races under one fence, protecting each other perfectly, but it was also an ironic treaty that sometimes required them to strip naked and reveal everything legally.

"Do you understand? Don't forget that we've been polite until now. This is an urgent situation, so please understand."

After saying that, Aryumun was about to move. He thought it was best to act quickly while Suhaksan was still unable to properly refute.

However...

"Wait, please."

At the voice that came, all the mages present froze as if their feet were glued to the ground. The sound of black high heels echoed, and the door to the conference room opened, revealing a woman in a black dress. She entered without a mask, making eye contact with the humans in the conference room.

If it were during the time when curses were strong, their magic would have backfired, causing them to go berserk, but now it only had the effect of stimulating their hearts to make them listen to her words. For powerful mages, unless she truly intended it, the curse wouldn't fully take effect.

"...Elf King, I didn't expect you to be here."

Even Aryumun couldn't treat the Elf King lightly. Her trait, [Charming Absorption], had a slight effect even on a 9th-class mage like Aryumun, making him feel his judgment waver.

"I heard your conversation. You said you would recklessly invade the roots of the World Tree."

"It's not reckless. If you look at the search warrant... a Grade 1 dangerous black mage is hiding here. We just found the most efficient way to protect the World Tree."

Aryumun said, trying to keep his tired eyes wide open. After looking at the warrant he handed over, Kkotseorin shook her head.

"You've worked hard. But from now on, you don't need to. I will take over the search for the black mage Cheoliban."

"Hmm..."

Several old mages turned their heads uncomfortably and cleared their throats at Kkotseorin's words. The search for black mages was clearly the responsibility of the Magic Association and the Magic Investigation Team, but this was the domain of the Elf King Kkotseorin. It was natural to hand over command to her, but...

The Magic Association had never once lost the right to search to a nation. Their abilities were superior to those of any nation. Led by the 9th-class mage Aryumun, followed by 8th-class elders, the Magic Association's power and influence were so strong that even nations couldn't refuse them. They had always wielded that power, invading the secret domains of other countries as if it were natural.

This time was no different. The only obstacle was that their opponent was the Elf King, who was said to be on par with a 9th-class mage.

"The World Tree is my domain. From now on, I will take command here. Thank you for your hard work."

Kkotseorin's gentle voice had a peculiar power, making the mages nod unconsciously. Her enchanting, magical voice made it seem impossible to refuse. When she smiled softly, the mages nodded vigorously as if they would give her their liver and gallbladder, but Aryumun did not.

"I'm sorry, but we can't step back, Elf King."

"...Is that so?"

"Yes. The black mage Cheoliban is extremely dangerous. We cannot put Your Majesty in danger. We will hand over command, but please allow us to assist in the extermination of the black mage."

"Hmm..."

It was exactly the answer Kkotseorin had expected. She had anticipated this response and had set up the situation accordingly. Normally, she would have refused here. She felt repulsed by the idea of humans trampling on the World Tree, and she preferred to work alone. However...

Before coming here, she remembered what Baek Yuseol had said in the Garden of Yiphanell.

"By now, some important people will be running around, saying they want to search. Please go and control them, Kkotseorin."

"Can't I just send them back?"

"No."

At that time, Baek Yuseol had spoken in a very firm voice, which was the first time he had been so resolute with her, making her feel bewildered, but strangely, she believed his words.

"Most likely, the head of the Magic Association, Aryumun, has come."

"Why?"

"The term 'tawny magic' refers to the black mage Cheoliban."

"Black mage Cheoliban?"

"Yes. You've heard of him, right? Head Aryumun has been chasing him all his life. If something bad happens, he will be a great help."

Thinking of that time, Kkotseorin looked at Aryumun and nodded.

"Alright. If it's just searching together, I welcome it."

How Baek Yuseol could deduce the black mage Cheoliban from the term 'tawny magic,' and how he knew the relationship between Cheoliban and Aryumun, she didn't know. But the situation outside was unfolding exactly as he had said. That alone increased the credibility of Baek Yuseol's words.

Kkotseorin decided to set aside her disgust at the sight of humans trampling on the World Tree and listen to the boy's words. That boy was the only person in this world she could trust and entrust her heart to.
