## Magic School's Front-Line Prodigy - Chapter 292 - 54. League of Spirits (5)

A low-key message appeared. It wasn't a major game, so there were no special alarms or even a live commentary, but most of the officials' viewing seats were already focused there. The lunch hour on Saturdays was usually deserted, except for a few training supervisors, but today, the seats were bustling.

"The beginning is ordinary."

The supervisors slowly examined the Full Flame team's positions. In the League of Spirits, those with the most one-on-one confidence were usually placed on the Central and Ascension lines. And so, Mayu-seong and Baek Yu-seol took their respective positions.

"Definitely... different from last time."

The game a week ago was a complete mess. They lacked even basic radar, meaning they had no situational awareness. Their route for hunting mini-monsters was the epitome of inefficiency. But just a week later, they were showing movements similar to those of ordinary, average trainees. Recognizing basic meta and flow and acting accordingly.

"Their magic is completely different from last time?"

"Hmm. It means they've figured out what they need to use."

"Well... the magic tree changes with each game based on the opponent's magic combination and strategy."

With only seven spells, it was easy to memorize and decipher them, making it easier to counter. Thus, players had to practice using multiple spells. In Rios, surviving with only one or two combinations was difficult.

"Baek Yu-seol is still only using Blink."

Skills like Tai-ryung-shin-gong were unfortunately not classified as "magic", so Baek Yu-seol again entered the arena with only Blink. That's why the officials were questioning. If she couldn't use offensive spells, how would she attack her opponents?

As an answer, Baek Yu-seol purchased a supporting item, [Magic Sword], and held it in her hand.

"Magic Sword..."

"Is that even useful?"

"It seems in the real world, they've modified and used Magic Swords, but wouldn't that be impossible in Rios?"

Baek Yu-seol's Teriphon wand was specially modified with the Magic Sword, giving it a power level unlike other Magic Swords. But Magic Swords in Rios only had low attack power, serving as a supporting item for close-range defense against enemies. They were definitely not powerful enough to kill.

Supporting items had limited upgrades, meaning that if used as a main weapon, it could be a little unique in the early stages, but wouldn't be able to do anything in the later stages.

"We'll have to watch to find out."

Baek Yu-seol calmly swung the Magic Sword and hunted monsters. Since the monsters' movements were fixed like machines, she moved flexibly without taking a single hit and swung her sword. Considering how ordinary mages would be unable to move or slow down when using magic, her movements were quite dynamic, and it was estimated that the attack power of her "normal attack" was significantly higher than other mages. However... that was all.

Normal attacks, also known as "basic attacks", ultimately lacked decisive power.

[Combat initiated]

Soon after the game started, a fight broke out on the central line. Mayu-seong used long-range harassing spells with low power but a short cooldown, allowing for frequent use. After gaining strength through monster hunting and learning the Power Jump spell, she immediately rushed at the opponent.

Instantly, the players quickly judged Mayu-seong's actions. Full Flame was waiting on the nearby Alley line, while the enemy Alley line was currently supporting the Descent line.

At this moment, the standard move for a normal central laner would be to cast an Ensnaring, kidnapping the enemy into their own territory, or using stuns to temporarily disable the enemy while waiting for backup from the Alley line.

So naturally, everyone expected Mayu-seong to do the same...

"Huh?"

**Ku-gung!!**

Instead of sending the enemy to her team's territory, Mayu-seong used Power Jump to dash forward and then landed a powerful shockwave on the enemy's chest, knocking them back.

Following that, she mixed harassing spells and basic attacks to slowly chip away at the enemy's HP. At that moment, Full Flame's 'Special Monster' hunt was successful, increasing the team's resources by one level. Mayu-seong immediately purchased an additional spell and finished off the enemy. Then, she calmly returned with a sliver of HP remaining.

"What the...?"

"Are they not cooperating?"

In normal situations, it would be standard for Full Flame to help, but she only glanced at Mayu-seong and continued diligently clearing the Alley line monsters, regardless of whether she was fighting or not.

Mayu-seong's magic tree also seemed to be designed for solo killing of the enemy, not for fighting in conjunction with her teammates.

"They weren't completely devoid of coordination..."

If you think about it carefully, Mayu-seong's timing for entering the fight perfectly coincided with Full Flame's Special Monster hunt. In other words, she had considered the next spell she would learn through Full Flame's actions and entered the fight. The enemy's weakness, the cooldown of the current spells, and the Special Monster's HP that Full Flame was hunting were all considered. This meant that Mayu-seong's eyes saw the perfect timing for the attack.

"Her judgment to see that timing is astonishing, but her resolve to charge in without hesitation is no ordinary feat either..."

"Isn't that not the problem? It looks like they don't trust each other at all. The entire team is playing individually."

"Even their magic trees have almost no spells that connect with each other. It's like they're each acting on their own."

"What are they thinking...?"

The League of Spirits is a 5v5 cooperative sport. It's definitely not a solo sport. But even after 5 minutes, 10 minutes of the game, the Full Flame team never showed a single instance of proper cooperative play. They were each killing their opponents in their own lines, and when multiple enemies approached, they would abandon their territory and run away without hesitation.

As the game reached the 15-minute mark, someone exclaimed, seeing Baek Yu-seol, whose presence had been overshadowed by Mayu-seong and other players.

"Whoa? What's that item?"

Even within Rios' game, there were trends and metas, meaning that only frequently used items were used, while abandoned items never appeared in the game. Although countless items existed, only certain ones were used.

That's why Baek Yu-seol's [Obsessive Determination Pendant] seemed quite unfamiliar. It had never been seen in the game before.

[Obsessive Determination Pendant]

*Required Magic Power: 2,700 MP

*Equip Effect: Attack Power +90, Attack Speed +7%

*Special Effect: After hitting an enemy with 10 "normal attacks," the final hit triggers "Obsessive Destruction" magic, dealing 274% of the user's attack power.

*Cooldown: 60 seconds

Just looking at the description was confusing. Unlike other items that consumed 2,700 MP, most of them boosted stats by 200. But this item only increased attack power by 90.

Plus, what was this special effect? It wasn't magic, and you had to hit 10 normal attacks?

"274% is definitely insane."

"No item has ever offered that kind of overwhelming attack count."

"But where will you have time to hit 10 normal attacks during a fight?"

"It's even a sword for Baek Yu-seol's normal attack. Not a long-range spell."

"The cooldown is too long. It's a whopping 60 seconds."

"But this item...?"

But this time, Baek Yu-seol's newly purchased item was also quite noticeable.

[Rhythmic Shoes]

*Required Magic Power: 2,700 MP

*Equip Effect: Movement Speed +125, Attack Speed +12%, Mana Recovery +70

*Special Effect: When an attack hits an enemy, the cooldown of 'Special Effect Items' decreases by 3 seconds.

This was also a never-before-seen item.

"It reduces the cooldown of special effect items with each hit...?"

Finally, the officials understood the intent.

"They're trying to continuously decrease the Pendant's cooldown with this item, stacking damage onto the enemy..."

The theory was clear, but whether it would actually work was still unknown.

Just then, the enemy Ascension and Alley laners appeared from the Alley, creating a 1 vs 2 situation.

Normally, running away would be the right move, but she had only used Blink a maximum of 3 consecutive times, making her vulnerable to being caught by the enemy's mobility.

But Baek Yu-seol did something strange. Instead of running away with all her might, she was hitting mini-monsters one by one and stealing the last hit while running.

No matter how much you cared about wasted mana, that seemed like excessive greed, especially since the enemy team was close behind.

"She's finished."

Just when the enemy team's charge spell was about to hit, Baek Yu-seol suddenly turned around and blinked towards the enemy's embrace.

"She's going to fight?"

You can't think of the 12-level AI the same way as regular players. They have an overwhelming growth rate, giving them much better items than regular players.

...However, Baek Yu-seol, completely ignoring that notion, used 2 consecutive Blinks to dash at the Alley laner pursuing from behind, instantly severing his neck.

Immediately, a white flash resembling a straight line appeared, leaving the enemy player staggering and collapsing to his knees.

Powerful stun effect!

"Wh-what?"

"No way!"

Baek Yu-seol had clearly only attacked once, but how could the special effect activate?

Baek Yu-seol didn't stop there. She performed a backflip and dropped a Flame Grenade on the ground. It created a powerful fire pit for 3 seconds, but due to its high mana consumption, it was rarely used. You needed to hit the entire 3 seconds, which wasn't easy.

But the enemy who had been hit by Obsessive Destruction was in a stun state, unable to move and caught in the flames, burning to death.

Baek Yu-seol continued to freely use Blink, dodging all of the remaining enemy spells, and swung her sword twenty times. It cut through both mini-monsters and players, and finally, another blinding white flash appeared.

And then, the second enemy fell.

Baek Yu-seol, having instantly defeated two enemies, used her Sticky Bomb item to destroy the enemy's tower. By the time the enemy player returned, she had already calmly returned to base.

"So... it wasn't about hitting the same enemy 10 times. It meant hitting mini-monsters 10 times and then hitting the enemy team."

"I-is that right?"

"To be able to manage the stacks like that..."

"It's amazing, but..."

When they thought about it, it did seem like a good item, but they were still unsure if it was truly good. It was better to simply increase your own spell power and aim for a decisive hit with a powerful spell instead of struggling to manage stacks with mini-monsters.

"She's amazing. I've never seen a player who can use consumable special items like that."

"And this is only her second day of training?"

"She's created her own item tree and build without even playing a few games..."

They finally understood how Baek Yu-seol fought, but they still weren't satisfied. It was a method that no one else could replicate.

The game had already surpassed the middle point and entered the late game. The Full Flame team still played individually, not connecting at all. Hae-won-ryang and Aezel stuck together, killing two or three enemies at once. Baek Yu-seol continued to solo-carry the Ascension line, using the same method as before. Mayu-seong, needless to say, pushed the central line all the way to the enemy's territory. Full Flame constantly circled the Alley line, ensuring she cleared all her own monsters and even went as far as killing the enemy's Alley player and stealing his resources, gradually closing the gap in resources with the 12-level AI.

And then, finally...

The 'Guardian' that appeared during the game would grant a tremendous buff to the team that killed it, swaying the tide of the match. The 'Chaos Guardian' would appear in the late game, usually leading to a final team fight.

The unavoidable fight. Even if they had avoided 5v5 fights so far, if they lost the Guardian buff, there would be no chance of victory.

'What are they going to do?'

They watched with bated breath. Baek Yu-seol was busy hitting the tower, as if she had spread honey on the Ascension line, not even thinking about coming out. Full Flame, sensing this opportunity, swept through the enemy's Alley line, stealing monsters.

Hae-won-ryang and Aezel seemed to be facing off over the Guardian, but they quickly lost interest and moved to another line together, doing something else.

"What are they... doing?"

The Chaos Guardian provided a near-invincible buff in the late game, so they absolutely needed to snatch it.

"They can't possibly not know that, can they?"

No way. Unlike a week ago when they were complete beginners, this game proved that they understood the meta. That meant...

"They don't need the Guardian buff to win...?"

Just as they thought that, Baek Yu-seol, who had almost pushed the Ascension line to its limit, suddenly used her 'Jump Gear' item. This item allowed you to travel to a pre-determined location by placing a target. If the enemy team found and erased the target, it would be useless, but if hidden well, it could provide a strategic advantage.

It was good that they had hidden the target well enough for the enemy team to not find it, but it was too risky to fight alone now.

"...A risky move."

"She's doomed."

The supervisors shook their heads. Baek Yu-seol's current action was a method that only appeared among beginners. When your team was losing, you'd launch a suicidal attack on the enemy team trying to capture the Guardian, pouring magic on them and dying.

This kind of gamble might work in matches between amateurs, but it never works against pros. They'd block the entrance and use perfect damage control to prevent the Guardian from dying to the enemy's attack.

But they had forgotten something crucial. Baek Yu-seol possessed special items that could deliver powerful damage instantly without any delay, and she also had Blink, which provided mobility exceeding Power Jump.

"Could it be...?"

The AI team, spotting Baek Yu-seol, reacted instantly, but she dashed into the enemy's embrace with consecutive Blinks like a ghost, swinging her sword.

She was wearing items that were not normally used, but only Baek Yu-seol, who mainly used "basic attacks," could utilize them. She swung her sword towards the Guardian, leaving a long flash mark, instantly killing it.

The enemy team immediately focused their attacks, instantly killing Baek Yu-seol, but Full Flame members rushed forward and surrounded them, wiping out the AI team.

They still had no synergy or coordination, but with the Guardian buff, their stats were similar to the 12-level AI, allowing them to crush their opponents with overwhelming physical abilities and spell casting speed. Their magic utilization had already surpassed that of the 12-level AI.

Even though they had only played three practice matches...

"...It's over."

The match ended with individual play and personal gambles with little practical value, ending with a resounding victory for the Full Flame team.

"They're incredible, but..."

"I don't know how to describe it..."

It was a parade of nonsensical strategies that would never appear in professional matches. Having never seen anything like it, the officials were speechless for a while, but they quickly regained their composure and began analyzing the match objectively.

"It's all just a facade."

If they had succeeded even once in a real match against a pro, they might have received applause. But their opponent was an AI.

"It's impressive that they managed to defeat the 12-level AI in a week. But that strategy will never work in a real match."

"Right. Stella's trainee players are already skilled enough to participate in amateur leagues. Would this nonsensical strategy and gambling play work against them?"

"It's amazing, but... there's a clear limit to their growth."

That was the conclusion reached by the experts.
