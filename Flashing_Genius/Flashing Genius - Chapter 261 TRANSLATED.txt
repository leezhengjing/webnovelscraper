# I Became a Genius at the Magic Academy 261

## 50. Noble Soul (11)

Soya struggled to understand Baek Yuseol's words with a bewildered expression.

"Who did you say to kill?"

It was definitely Cheolribeon. The black magician who challenged the Black Magic King, was defeated, and fled to save his worthless life. Now, he was known as a 'traitor' whose whereabouts were unknown.

"Cheolribeon? Did you say Cheolribeon?"

"Yes. Why? Are you scared?"

"Hah... You must be ignorant because you're human..."

She brushed her hair back behind her neck and spoke.

"Cheolribeon is the worst criminal even in the black magic society. If you offer his head to the Black Magic King, you can receive an enormous reward. Why do you think no one has hunted him down yet?"

Because Cheolribeon was strong enough to challenge the Black Magic King. And his whereabouts had been unknown for years.

"It's been years since he disappeared. I've looked for him a few times, but hunting Cheolribeon is impossible..."

"You're just wagging your tongue."

"...What?"

Since there was nothing to gain from prolonging the conversation, Baek Yuseol cut off her excuses and continued.

"Do you think I would propose this without considering such trivial matters? I know Cheolribeon's whereabouts. And I also know that you can't defeat him."

Soya's expression hardened. She couldn't defeat Cheolribeon. That was a clear fact. How many existing black magicians could defeat him? Probably no one except the Black Magic King...

So, Soya was about to reject the proposal. No matter how tempting Baek Yuseol's method of perfectly absorbing the heart of the spirit was, it wasn't worth risking her life.

Therefore, Baek Yuseol had to offer a condition that would entice her.

"You can't kill Cheolribeon in a direct fight."

"But there is a way to win."

"What? That's the same thing. Are you playing word games now?"

"It's different. It seems you don't understand."

Only then did Soya's mind light up as she belatedly understood Baek Yuseol's words. She couldn't kill him in a direct fight, but... there was a way to win.

"All you need to do is bring Cheolribeon's head. Why bother with a direct confrontation?"

"That means..."

"He has a very fatal weakness. I know what it is. So, do you want to make a deal?"

"...Cheolribeon has a weakness? Even if that's true, how can I believe it?"

How should he persuade her further? What evidence should he present? In fact, everything he said was a lie.

Soya was dangerous. Not only did she have a special ability to steal the heart of the spirit, but even in terms of pure physical ability, Baek Yuseol would be defeated before a proper fight could begin.

But he couldn't just leave this woman who threatened Yiphanel alone.

'Using one to control another.'

This woman couldn't defeat Cheolribeon. Even if the sky fell and the world restarted, that fact wouldn't change. In the original Aither World Online, there were several scenes of Soya and Cheolribeon's battles, and Cheolribeon always won overwhelmingly.

The reason was that Cheolribeon's abilities were a superior version of Soya's. In other words, sending her to Cheolribeon was a way to deal with her without getting his hands dirty.

'To entice her here, another lie...'

Just as Baek Yuseol was about to shake Soya's mind with another lie, he felt a strange sensation and narrowed his eyes. As he stared into her eyes, he felt something.

Fragments of various emotions were visible. This was undoubtedly the ability of Yeon Hongchun Samwol.

'...More positive than I thought?'

He thought she would be more suspicious, but she was already half convinced.

'In that case, rather than a clumsy lie...'

Clearing his throat, Baek Yuseol spoke in a nonchalant voice.

"You are very suspicious. The proposal is canceled. I made the offer believing in your reputation for being strong enough to steal the heart of the spirit, but now I see you're no different from Cheolribeon, a coward. I'll ask someone else."

As he said that and reached for his shoes, Soya's clone, who had approached without a sound, grabbed his wrist.

Smack!

He was very surprised as he hadn't felt her movement, but he pretended to know in advance and spoke calmly.

"So, have you changed your mind?"

"...I'll listen. What is that weakness? Can I really take his head? And can you help me absorb the heart?"

She was hooked. Baek Yuseol subtly raised the corners of his mouth and nodded.

"Alright, let's talk slowly."

* * *

"...Hoo!"

As the clone returned, numerous memories were transmitted to Soya's mind. Slowly opening her eyes, she shook her throbbing head and pondered Baek Yuseol's words.

"Cheolribeon's weakness... He really has been chasing Cheolribeon for a long time."

He knew more about Cheolribeon than any other black magician. The only contractor of Damgalt Oiwol in the world and the fugitive who survived after challenging the Black Magic King.

"I don't know why a magician, not a black magician, is chasing him... but Baek Yuseol was sincere enough to say he would help in the fight himself."

"Why?"

Baek Yuseol was full of mysteries. Was he really a magician? Was he even human?

There was nothing she could know. But it didn't seem to matter much. The fact that Baek Yuseol's goal and her goal aligned this time was all that mattered.

"Are you back now, Soya?"

Hearing a woman's voice from behind, Soya turned her head with a hardened expression. There stood a woman in a particularly revealing outfit, which was ironic considering it was supposed to be a robe that covered the whole body.

The woman elegantly walked over, her light green robe fluttering, and whispered to Soya.

"Toa sent me. Recently, it seems you've been up to something... He said he would kill you."

"...Did the Green Tower Master say that to me? Hmph, ridiculous."

Soya scoffed, but she couldn't easily dismiss his words. Toa Legron. A 9th-class magician and her master, the Green Tower Master, was none other than the 'King of Pureblood Witches.'

There were very few people in this world who inherited the bloodline of a 'pureblood witch.' Soya, too, was a half-witch, closer to a human or black magician.

"There are only a handful of witches left in this world, including you. No matter how much of a half-witch you are, he doesn't want to kill the few remaining witches with his own hands. So, why don't you stay quiet for a while?"

No matter how strong a witch was, they were almost exterminated by witch hunters and magicians. If she did anything noticeable, she would quickly become a target. Toa Legron's master didn't want that.

"Hah, a magician... so arrogant."

"Is that so?"

"Mind your own business and go your way. I might want to kill you."

"Oh my, how scary~"

The woman exaggeratedly pretended to be scared, waved her hand, and walked away.

"I was going to leave anyway~ There's a boy my master has taken an interest in recently. Was his name Baek Yuseol?"

"What?"

"Have you heard of him?"

Soya reacted for a moment to the woman's words but then shook her head.

"Hmm. Anyway, I'll be going now, so stay quiet! Goodbye~"

After she left, Soya licked her lips and organized her thoughts.

"That old hag is interested in him...?"

The fact that she, who had no interest in worldly matters except for witches, was interested in Baek Yuseol was already proof that he was not ordinary.

"He's definitely worth using."

Cheolribeon's head. And the heart of the spirit. Thinking that all those things might fall into her hands, her smile deepened.

* * *

Crack!

"Ugh...!"

Cheolribeon snapped the neck of a black magician with both arms. Of course, this wouldn't kill a black magician. Only by piercing and destroying the heart, the source of their black magic, could their life be completely extinguished.

Squelch!

Like swatting a mosquito with a fly swatter, Cheolribeon nonchalantly pulled out the heart of a black magician with his bare hands and sighed as if it was bothersome.

"Hoo~ I handled it quietly."

He tried to prevent the black magic from leaking out as much as possible. He realized this time that fighting without releasing his power was more difficult than he thought.

"Then, can I pass quietly this time?"

As he dusted off his hands, Cheolribeon muttered.

"Who said you could?"

A young man's voice echoed like a reverberation from the air. The voice was so familiar and annoying that Cheolribeon's expression twisted.

"...Who are you?"

Leisurely raising his head and looking up at the sky, he saw Aryumun approaching as if walking on transparent stairs in the air.

"It was hard to find you. If those bugs hadn't picked a fight with you, it might have been a bit more difficult..."

A languid and relaxed voice. The peculiar tone that made even the listener feel sleepy only irritated Cheolribeon.

"Hah... Can't you just let it go this time? Are you really going to fight here? It's not my place to say, but the World Tree will be completely destroyed, and there will be innocent casualties."

"I don't care."

This time, someone else answered. Quickly turning around, he saw a woman covered in a black robe elegantly walking towards him.

'Elf King.'

He could tell instantly. Such a special and vivid aura of the World Tree couldn't be possessed by just anyone. Even the World Tree itself wouldn't be purer than her.

"The World Tree won't be harmed."

"...This is troublesome. Why would the Elf King come here? To catch me?"

"Don't worry, it's not for such a trivial reason. You are just a minor task to be dealt with while I'm on a very important mission."

Ggotseorin genuinely looked displeased. Whatever her 'very important mission' was, the fact that it was more important than Cheolribeon, who had made a name for himself in legends, was quite shocking.

"I'm not someone to be treated like this..."

What should he do? Cheolribeon sensed the auras of the Elf King and the Association President blocking him from the front and back. One was a 9th-class magician. The other was a high elf blessed by the World Tree.

No matter how powerful Cheolribeon was, having challenged the Black Magic King, it seemed he wouldn't be able to avoid a tough battle.

'But... I can't avoid the fight.'

Thinking that far, he actually felt excited. Cheolribeon slowly raised the corners of his mouth into a bizarre smile. A smile filled with pure 'joy.'

"Alright... I was bored anyway. Both of you, come at me."

He cracked his wrists.

"But one of you should be prepared to lose your head."
