## Chapter 177 – Party Time – Concerns about Room 104, Exploring the 2nd Floor (4)

**Date:** Day 89
**Current Location:** Floor 1, Corridor
**Sage's Advice:** 0

Han Gain was bewildered by the sage's advice, which was both familiar and unfamiliar. Those around her started asking questions. "What did it say?" "..." "Another one of the Owl's cryptic riddles, I guess." "It said, 'The wisest creates a game where everyone benefits.'"  

Silence fell over the table for a moment. Eun Sol broke the silence first. "It feels vaguely familiar. I'll explain it briefly as I know it. When businesspeople plan their strategies, creating a situation that only benefits them is considered amateur. If you're the only one benefiting, the other party will naturally react violently, and the whole structure will crumble."

"So, you're saying that a stable structure is created when everyone benefits?"

"Exactly. That way, everyone is satisfied, the structure doesn't collapse, and everyone gets rich together. This is a bit like game theory, have you heard of it? Nash equilibrium?"

Nash equilibrium refers to a situation in game theory where players have made the best possible choices and have no incentive to change their strategies. In simpler terms, it means that 'no one wants to break a situation where everyone benefits.'

"I understand the meaning in a similar way, but I have so many doubts. First, who exactly is 'the wisest'? Thinking simply, based on the word 'wisdom,' it seems like the Owl is advising me to play a wise game."

"The wisest? I thought of the Owl, the Patron of Wisdom."

Ari shook her head immediately. "The Owl isn't the subject. You have to consider the rest of the sentence too. 'The being that creates the game' is the subject, right? In this hotel, the Patrons can't be the ones creating the game. I think it's referring to 'the Lord.'  A being beyond mortals, like a god, so 'the wisest' would be a fitting epithet."

Ari's point was valid. In this place, the hotel, the Patrons are distant figures and couldn't be the ones 'creating the game.' However, if the subject is the 'Lord,' then why use the word 'wisdom'? In the hotel, 'wisdom' is the name of my blessing. The Owl, who puts meaning in every single word, wouldn't use that word without intention.

I remembered what the senior member in Room 201 had said. The Owl enjoys giving riddle-like answers not to mock or torment me. He uses expressions with multiple interpretations to pack as much meaning as possible into short sentences. The mystery that had plagued us throughout Room 201, 'Geonji Mangwol.' What was the finger, and what was the essence?  At first, we thought the cube was the finger and the HQ was the essence. Then we thought it was about Beatrix, who sent a clone and had her brain elsewhere. In the end, it seems 'Beatrix' itself was the finger, and the ultimate meaning was to focus on the 'prisoner' as the essence. Maybe all these interpretations were conveyed in those four characters? From that perspective, the Owl's words shouldn't be interpreted as having one correct answer.  The very purpose is to convey multiple interpretations at once.

"I think both are correct. The subject could be Han Gain or the 'Lord.' So, maybe the Owl's advice means something like this." I wrote my interpretation on the whiteboard.

1. The 'Lord' has already created a game where everyone benefits.
2. If you want to break that game, you must also create another game where everyone benefits.

Ari, after tilting her head for a moment, muttered. "I don't think we can draw a conclusion with just that..."

You're right. It was clearer than the initial advice, but it was still abstract. It wasn't easy to understand. It seemed like we'd need more advice before drawing further conclusions. The problem was the hotel's cold. Starting tomorrow, I wouldn't be able to use advice with the sole purpose of resolving my curiosity about Room 104.

Suddenly, Ari looked slightly tired. "Wasn't the story about Room 104 mentioned before?"

"It was."

"Don't you think you're getting too obsessed with figuring out Room 104? I don't understand why we have to go there at all. The hotel isn't structured in a way where you have to solve every room, is it?"

"..."

"You regret missing the legacy of Room 104? But you already received compensation from Room 104, separate from the legacy."

You're right. I already received the powerful reward of 'Descent' from Room 104. Eun Sol, my sister, slightly took my side. "I understand Gain's thinking.  It's natural to think that the first floor is easier than the second. It can be unsettling to leave a reward on a supposedly easier floor while you're progressing to a more difficult one."

"That makes sense, but Room 104 is strange. There are so many strange aspects. You could call it a 'rotten room' because of its strangeness."

"That... That's true. It's a strange room.  There's a creepy vibe to it."

I understand what she means. It's a thought I often have. I've cleared all the rooms on the first floor, even the room with the most difficult challenge, but that one place, Room 104, remains unknown.  Strangely, I received the reward of 'Descent' from Room 104 without even solving it.  Oddly, the prisoner in Room 104 distorted even the hotel's notification and said, 'You haven't failed.' Strangely, I need to use three pieces of advice to ask a question related to Room 104. In the hotel, strangeness means misfortune and fear.  All these strange changes are making my companions fear Room 104.

...I felt an eerie sensation.  A vision of a cunning spider looking down at us from a very high place appeared. Those caught in its sticky web couldn't easily break free, even if they wanted to. What kind of game is 'the Lord' planning?

Just as silence settled, someone walked over from afar. "I'm here!"

"Huh? Seung Yeop?" It hadn't even been 30 minutes since he left the Sanctuary of Blessings? The reason was quickly revealed. He chose to save his contribution points, just like I used to do, and then get a strong boost all at once. 

"Oh, and the Patron said something about the cold."  The grandfather, who had been struggling with green tea ice cubes, opened his eyes wide and exclaimed. "What? Did that little rascal give you a decent hint?"

"...He said to prepare for the cold diligently?"  You gave that kind of nonsense as advice? Are you the Owl? Everyone was momentarily speechless, wondering what the hell that was about.

With Seung Yeop's return, the conversation naturally shifted from Room 104 to preparations for the cold. Eun Sol started talking. "Let's start with the obvious. We need to prepare for the cold like it's the winter solstice. I've already ordered everything we need from the market. Just in case, I also ordered tents."

The grandfather immediately replied. "Start gathering hotel supplies from today.  Can't we bring any supplies from the underground facilities? There were a lot of high-performance cold-weather gear in the 'Mountain Climbing Room.'"

"It's probably difficult. Those items disappear when you take them out of the room."

"Then, turn that parrot into a chicken and pluck its feathers."

— Beep!

"Beep you little sh*t!  Even if you collected as many feathers as the hair I pulled out of your head, it wouldn't be enough for a single hat!"

Fero? Did you really pluck that much hair off the grandfather's head? 

"Come on, come on, everyone quiet down. We've been through this, right? Everyone figure out your own way to find stuff in the hotel that you can use to prepare for the cold."

What could I possibly bring? It's unfortunate that we can't bring anything from the underground facilities, which have everything, so we have to search the first floor. I noticed the curtains and tablecloths we used to make makeshift cold-weather gear.

Ari asked, "Speaking of finding stuff, can we use 'Greedy Hands'?  Maybe we can find some suitable supplies for the cold weather."

"I was thinking the same thing, but it's still unavailable after getting the eyeball last time. It seems like a skill with a very long cooldown."

"It's a skill that gives you supernatural equipment every time you use it, so that's understandable. It's a shame we can't use it now."

While everyone was discussing how to survive the hotel's growing cold, I was preoccupied with a different concern. Simply enduring the cold wasn't enough. Eventually, we'd have to end the hotel's sudden ice age, and the answer to that problem would inevitably lie on the second floor. I needed to go to the second floor and see what was happening.

"Shouldn't we go to the second floor before the cold gets even worse?"  Everyone nodded, agreeing with my thought. Jin Cheol, the older brother, responded enthusiastically. "Good idea. It's what I was going to say anyway. Let's go to the second floor. Who wants to join me?"

He was suggesting it to everyone, but in truth, his eyes were on one person. Even I could see that the number of people suitable for the exploration and the appropriate members were clear.  Apart from Jin Cheol, who could resist the cold with the power of 'courage,' only the protective suit could withstand the harsh cold of the second floor and allow for exploration.  So, aside from Jin Cheol, only one person could participate in the exploration. Among us, there's also only one person who can see through the blizzard and survey the surroundings.

Eun Sol sighed heavily. "Ugh, I knew this would happen, which is why I didn't mention the second floor. Well, there's work to be done. Jin Cheol and I will go."

"Very well. I'll break the ice and open the way, and you can use your eyes to look around. We'll be fine no matter what we encounter."

The two of them seemed to have overlooked one fact.

"I'm sorry, but we need one more person."

"What? Did you forget that we only have one protective suit?"

"The other person doesn't have to participate in the exploration.  They can stay huddled in a corner with a blanket or whatever.  But we need one more person regardless.  Grandpa?"

The second floor is impossible to communicate on normally due to the blizzard.  We definitely need the support of the communication window. The grandfather grabbed the back of his neck. "Goodness! I thought I was old and could skip the hard stuff, but that young punk is dragging me into danger."

"..."

"Go, go!  Don't let the grass grow under your feet, right? Let's go!"

"Excuse me? The chef too?"

"..."

"..."

"Seung Yeop, you must be tired. Why don't you rest a little longer?"  Ari's kind words instantly brightened Seung Yeop's face. "Take Fero too!  I've been going back and forth to Room 201, and it seems Fero is pretty good at handling the cold."

— Beep! Beep!

"Aaargh! Don't bite! It hurts!"

For a brief moment, the heartwarming scene of a very angry parrot biting Song Yi's hair unfolded.
