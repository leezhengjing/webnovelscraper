## Chapter 145 - Rest and Reorganization (1)

**Date:** 74th Day

**Current Location:** Underground Layers, Ski Resort

**Sage's Advice:** 3]

— Amidst the swirling snow, my body hurtled down the ski resort slope. I focused my entire mind on a single point, keeping my gaze fixed on the front. Within the fleeting landscape around me, I saw people looking at me with worried expressions. Now is the time. The feather tattoo on my shoulder tingled slightly, and as if an invisible hand grabbed my collar and hurled me, I felt my entire body stretch and shift. … When I regained consciousness, I found myself suspended in the air.

“Aaaaaaaaaaack!” — Bang! From a distance, I heard the sound of the snow-covered ground exploding, and a giant who seemed to be almost 2 meters tall soared into the air, snatching me. — Boom! Thump! Thanks to the sturdy Form taking the brunt of the impact upon hitting the ground, I landed without too much injury.

“Ah, why is this so difficult? Jincheol Hyung, thank you. If it wasn't for you, this practice-” I stopped mid-sentence, finding something a little off and turned to look at Hyung. He seemed lost in thought.

“Hyung?”

“Ah, nothing much. Anyway, it seems this ‘teleportation’ is pretty difficult, isn't it? I've seen you do it about 7-8 times since two days ago, but it seems to be moving to weird places almost 50% of the time.”

“I'm sorry.”

“It's practice we're doing by mutual agreement, no need to apologize. But do you really have to do it while skiing?”

“After trying it a few times, I realized that using it while standing still is easy, but using it while moving is difficult, and using it while moving fast is even harder.”

“Is that so? Well, I suppose there's no harm in making practice intentionally difficult.”

Shish-shish-shish! With the sound of gliding down the slope, Ari arrived with graceful movements. Soon, Songi and Elena also arrived. As soon as she arrived, Ari pointed out with a playful expression.

“Every time you make a mistake, it seems like the directions are generally accurate, but you keep moving upwards?”

“That's true.”

“My guess is that when you focus on teleporting, you're afraid of going into the ground, so you instinctively keep focusing upwards.”

“Hmm….”

“It's like this. When you determine the direction you want to move from your initial position, you instinctively slightly raise the direction, as if you were afraid of going into the ground. You may not feel it, but even though you slightly raise it, you move over 10 meters in that twisted direction, so from the arrival point, the error is huge.”

“That's a convincing analysis.”

Even though it was nothing new, Ari, who has more experience with this kind of ‘superpower use’ than me, presented a plausible theory. While I was pondering, I felt a hand brush my hair and clothes, which were covered in snow after I fell and rolled on the ground. It felt soft, so I turned my head back, and there was Elena, naturally brushing my hair. … As our eyes met, we both simultaneously blushed and took a step back. It seems like Elena didn't do it intentionally either.

“Oh, there was too much snow, so I didn't realize….”

“Th, thank you.”

“…”

“…”

Awkward atmosphere. Thankfully, Ari broke the silence and continued speaking.

“It seems pretty risky to practice teleporting with your own body every time. You can't always have Jincheol there to save you. How about using Pero's body? Even if you move to the sky, you can just flap your wings and descend.”

Hearing that, Songi opened her mouth wide and whispered something to Pero. — Beep!

“Aaack! Aaack! Songi~ take this one away!”

Soon, a very angry parrot started pecking at Ari's hair, and the rest of us started laughing and leaving the ski resort.  Besides being funny, it was a pointless suggestion. The source of the teleportation ability is the tattoo engraved on my body. I can't use it while possessed. I already confirmed this yesterday before Ari suggested it.

After passing through the gate's room and being granted a week of rest, we simply relaxed, as there were no more places to explore on the first floor. Ari's blessing confirmed that there were no more places to explore on the first floor, so we simply relaxed. At first, we didn't understand why the second floor wasn't opened right away and instead opened a week later. But as time went on, we naturally understood. If they had opened the second floor right away, we would have spent our time exploring it instead of resting. That's why the hotel intentionally didn't open the second floor and gave us time to rest.

Everyone went to the facilities they wanted to enjoy. Songi, who learned about the darkness hidden in Elena's heart from ‘Perfect Life’, actively led us to the ski resort, and we all spent the first day there. Of course, not everyone enjoyed skiing. About half of us left for other facilities the next day. In this way, everyone took a break in the place they wanted, preparing for the second floor.

However, this place is ultimately a hotel. A place where countless trials await us. We couldn't relax completely. There are several important tasks that we need to solve during this period.

* “Achoo!”

“Jincheol Oppa? Are you okay?”

“Ah, I'm fine. I've been rolling around in the snow while trying to save some guy, so I'm coughing.”

I felt a pang of guilt.

“...I'm sorry.”

“It's fine! Let's just eat. By the way, this ski resort is really unusual. It feels like the clouds are surrounding the whole mountain?”

Songi looked around with an intrigued expression, turning her head from side to side.

“What's beyond the clouds?”

“It could be nothing, like the ‘Hiking Room’. That place also returned to the starting point if you went beyond a certain distance from the mountain. Maybe it's similar.”

After that conversation, we started eating simple sausages, hot dogs, and fish cakes prepared at the ski resort. After a while, the conversation naturally began. The topic we most often bring up since the start of our break: ‘sealing’. Jincheol Hyung was the first to speak.

“Anyway, I'm worried. This little guy, Gain, if he's not here, it'll be incredibly difficult to proceed.”

Ari also replied with a worried expression.

“Right. I feel bad for other abilities, but the biggest problem is understanding the scenario. Can we proceed without that ability…? ”

Seeing everyone worried about ‘my absence’, I felt a strange sense of joy. But in the end, I couldn't hide my own worry. What if everyone fails while I'm gone?  Wouldn't I just die without being able to do anything?

“Everyone, cheer up. If you think about it, didn’t we clear all the cursed rooms without understanding the scenario?”

Jincheol Hyung sighed even louder at those words.

“We just foolishly died while clearing them. We’ll have to do it that way again, huh?”

Our conversation with the others was based on one fact. It's almost certain that I will be sealed in the first room of the second floor. I'm the owner of the legacy and, even excluding it, I have gained various superpowers and tools, like descending, the pen, and teleportation. I even reinforced blessings multiple times to gain the powerful ability of ‘understanding the scenario’. It's not comparable to someone who gained two or three legacies like Ari's first-run hotel party, but even now, I'm in an over-grown state compared to others.

Ari spoke again.

“We can't just worry and leave it at that. Others, excluding Gain, need to find their own way to grow.”

Songi replied worriedly.

“That makes sense, but how? The second floor opens in five days from now.”

“There's still one cursed room left on the first floor.”

The last cursed room remaining on the first floor. Room 104, ‘Hotelgo, a prestigious school for college entrance exams’. Everyone shut their mouths when the story of that room came up.

Why are we avoiding Hotelgo? It was the most difficult to avoid when there were multiple cursed rooms left, but at this point, the difficulty of the room itself is no longer a problem. We've already cleared the gate's room, which is a higher stage than Hotelgo, and gained countless rewards. We can easily handle the threat of Hotelgo, which has already been revealed. The cult members from the old school building? Jincheol Hyung can wipe them out with his stars alone. I can also kill most of them using the possession of the grimoire, albeit it may take some time.

The problem is the ‘Master’. More precisely, the ‘Descending’ he left me. I decided to be honest about the part everyone secretly worried about.

“Isn't everyone worried that something might happen to me because of ‘Descending’?”

Ari immediately acknowledged it.

“Right. We really don't know what might happen. In the worst case, you might be taken over by the ‘Son of Heaven’ and betray us altogether.”

“…”

“If we had any red pills left, I would have given it to you and suggested we re-enter Hotelgo…. Of course, that's meaningless now that Pero already ate it.”

Songi weakly argued.

“Pero ate it and was very active in the gate's room.”

It was true, so no one refuted it.

Elena replied with a worried tone.

“Can we really be sure that something like that will happen?”

“I was just talking about the worst possibility. The problem is, this hotel is a place where the most terrible and ominous possibilities tend to become reality. Can you ask the advice for anything?”

“I already asked yesterday. I got a meaningless answer. It said I should think carefully and decide.”

“Your patron, the owl, is sometimes less helpful than Pero.”

Ari said it as if it were a mere guess based on an unfounded feeling. … But I understood that Ari wasn't just saying it out of a feeling. He just didn't want to explain the uncertain story in detail, so he spoke that way. I came to a similar conclusion through deduction. The true nature of Descending. The inhuman personality of the Son of Heaven I have already experienced. And the advice the owl gave me while I was clearing the gate's room, going so far as to take a reckless gamble. There's a high possibility that I will become ‘someone else’ if I enter Hotelgo.

How is it that he could attempt something the other prisoners, who also had different ‘Masters’, couldn't do? There's a secret about him.

I shook my head lightly, pushing away the unsolvable problem into the back of my mind. Thinking it was a similarly unsolvable conversation, Jincheol Hyung changed the topic.

“Haven't we already discussed this topic several times? And we always gave up. Like Ari said, if the problem is the possibility of Gain betraying us because of that ‘Master’, then we can't enter with Gain being the strongest among us. Let's find another way.”

Ultimately, we returned to the basics. It's almost certain that I will be sealed in the first room of the second floor. Is there any way for the others, excluding me, to grow during the break? The first option, entering Hotelgo, was rejected again. That's because the possibility of me being betrayed because of that ‘Master’ came up, and it’s a room where I am the strongest. We can't be sure if it's true until we try it, but if it is, it's scarier than the second floor where I'll be sealed.

So, what's the second option? The idea that Mookseong Grandpa came up with last night came to mind. Elena, who had the same thought, opened her mouth.

“I think it's better to use Eunsol Unni's Monkey Hand again. It wouldn't be too difficult if it's about the level of the Nightmare Butterfly event from before.”

Ari pointed out.

“Elena, it's not Monkey Hand, it's ‘Hand of Greed’.”

“Oops!”

‘Hand of Greed’, an ability that gives no penalty to its owner and only brings rewards. Eunsol unni herself was hesitant to use it because of its selfish characteristic, but everyone agrees that it's far more useful than it seems.

Growth options in the hotel are more limited than we think. It's not like those games that encourage grinding, where you can endlessly grow by hunting endlessly in hunting grounds. The places where you can farm are practically just the cursed rooms, and the cursed rooms disappear as soon as they are cleared. In this way, ‘Hand of Greed’ is essentially an ability that creates a ‘mini hunting ground’ periodically in a place where growth options themselves are limited.

The brief meeting at the ski resort ended there.

*

— Gain

I left the ski resort and returned to the first floor of the hotel. It was evening, so the others who were resting in different places started gathering in Room 105. We exchanged light greetings, and as soon as we entered Room 105, everyone was speechless. A giant hazmat suit placed near the entrance. What are we supposed to do with that thing?

It's been three days since we got the hazmat suit. For three days, the hazmat suit has turned us into blind men. It's almost the size of a person, and it's like it's saying, ‘Do something about me’, but everyone just passed by, as if they couldn't see it.  Everyone flinched if someone accidentally touched it.

We need to address the issue of the hazmat suit.  Sword-proof, fire-proof! It's not just a simple escape tool, it's a very useful armor. We can't avoid it forever.  That's why we placed it at the entrance of the room so we wouldn't forget about it.

“Wait! Attention!”

Three days since we got the hazmat suit. Finally, Ari took the lead and spoke.
