## Chapter 153 – Room 201, The Cursed Room – ‘□ □□’ (2)

I conveyed my deduction through the chat window while heading toward the third house. The space beyond the doors existing in the house was distorted, and it seemed to be constantly changing. It seems like the number of houses is not one.  

I decided to shorten my speech since it's time to save some characters in the chat window, and then entered the third house. This time, we entered through the back door. The appearance of the house was no different from its previous form. We couldn't move carelessly after witnessing the catastrophe Oliver had experienced on the carpet. 

Eventually, Elizabeth began to give instructions. “Don't scatter around carelessly. Let's check the rooms starting from the reception room one by one. Be careful as much as possible, and be ready to react immediately in case the monster attacks. Let's go!” The house wasn't that big, so the search didn't take long. There was no problem with the carpet in the third house. Soon, we passed the reception room and headed towards the living room, and Cha Jincheol was the first to discover something peculiar. 

“Cha Jincheol? Did you find something strange?” “Come over here everyone! The TV is strange.” As soon as we approached, we understood what he meant. The TV began to flicker and blink strangely. Was it the carpet in the second house and the TV in the third? Everyone picked up their guns with a sense of tension, thinking that the monster might appear – and then, the TV turned on. – “Click! Click! Bam!” “What? Oh! It suddenly turned on!” “What’s going on? Did someone touch the remote?” 

Suddenly, the music of the Pledge to the National Flag, which I had heard since elementary school, began to play. 

/”Doo— Doo — Doo Doo Doo! Doo— Doo — Doo Doo Doo!”  “In a moment, the pledge will begin.  All you toys, please wait in a proper position.”/

 Toys? As soon as the voice came out of the TV, an inexplicable force stopped all of our movements. 
 
 /
 ”Pledge. I am a slave. I have eyes, yet cannot see the truth, thus I am unworthy of opening my eyes. 
 I have ears, yet cannot hear the distant sounds, thus I am unworthy of hearing. 
 I shall offer everything to the Great One. 
 I swear, please carve my limbs beautifully, fry them half with soy sauce and half with fried chicken, and enjoy them deliciously! 
 / 
 
 After the pledge with absurd content was broadcast, our mouths were forced to move and follow the content. 
 
 /”Everyone has sworn.  
 Shall we fry the half-and-half chicken according to the pledge? 
 Ding-dong!”/ 
 
 With crazy sounds, a boiling oil cauldron appeared on the TV screen! 
 
 Suddenly, a black hand stretched out from the display and grabbed Elena, pulling her toward the TV. 
 — “Wooosh!” A star appeared in front of Jincheol. We couldn't move, but could he summon stars? But this is a mistake! Jincheol himself can't move.  
 
 Naturally, the star, which didn't have any guiding function, couldn't move either, and stayed in front of Jincheol, and the distance between the star and us was closer than the distance between the star and the TV. 
 
 Before the TV changed, Songyi's skin next to me was about to turn inside out, and I started feeling a terrible sensation of my hair turning into flesh. 
 
 Jincheol, realizing the situation belatedly, immediately recalled the star. In the end, the arm that emerged from the TV started pulling the immobile Elena “inside the display”!  
 
 The giant cauldron inside the TV was full of boiling oil, bubbling fiercely.  
 
 Everyone's faces turned white because it was so clear what was going to happen. — “Bang! Bang!” With the sound of gunshots, the display exploded.  
 
 Immediately, our bodies, which had been bound, were released, and Elena, who had been pulled in with her entire upper body, bounced back. I turned my gaze, and I saw Mookseong's hand floating in the air.  He could operate the remote-controlled gloves even while his body was stopped! Elizabeth exclaimed. 
 
 “Mookseong! Good job! It was about to be a terrible event.” I was really about to have a heart attack. If Mookseong hadn't controlled the gloves to shoot the TV, we wouldn't have been able to move, and Elena, who had been dragged inside the TV… Let's just stop imagining. I felt sick just thinking about it. 
 
 Jincheol apologized to Songyi in a panic, looking at her skin that had turned a colorful hue, and Songyi said it was unavoidable because the situation was urgent.  My hair is mixed with tentacles now. Well, the hotel will take care of it once we get out. I ran to Elena in a hurry. “Are you okay? Elena?” Elena, who had been dragged inside the TV and bounced back, was speechless. “Elena?” Elena looked back at me with a blank expression.  The people around her finally gathered. 
 
 “Elena? Are you okay?” “Elena Unnie?” Elena's lips opened. “I saw… I saw…” “What do you mean you saw?” “Eyes inside the TV.” “Eyes? What are you talking about all of a sudden?” 
 
 “Eyes.” “Elena? Are you okay?” 
 
 “Eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes. See the eyes flashing from the cracks. See the eyes looking down from outside. Did you feel like someone was watching you from behind while you were walking down a dark road? Did you feel someone else's gaze while you were typing on your keyboard alone in your room? Little children can't sleep because they think that the rolling dolls are looking at them. In the sky at dawn, there is a gaze that scorns those who go to work early. On the land at noon, there is an eye that gazes silently at the world full of vitality. Ah! The whole world is eyes. I saw 3,000 gazes covering the horizon. The greatest eye captured everything from the abyss to the sky, so naturally, we are also within it.” ??? 
 
 Elena suddenly stopped talking and looked up at the ceiling with her eyes wide open. “You're here too. No, you're all over this place. Goodbye everyone!” — “Bang!” Suddenly, Elena shot herself, and everyone shouted, “Oh, oh, oh!” at her bizarre words spoken like a crazy person. 
 
 We were stunned, unable to accept the sudden change in the situation. 
 
 * The second shocking accident that happened in an instant, Elena's suicide driven by madness. Since entering the hotel, it's not uncommon for colleagues to die.  Someone dies, and we go out and meet again several times.  Songyi and Seungyeop, who used to seem fragile, had long since adapted to their colleagues dying.  But… This death is one of the most “bizarre” among the deaths of colleagues we've witnessed in the hotel. Seungyeop's mental state started to crumble. “Isn't it true that we chose the room through luck? Then, a safe room should come out! Why - ” 
 
 Seungyeop, bringing up the story of blessings in front of Elizabeth!  I was taken aback, but fortunately, she seemed preoccupied with checking around the shattered TV.  I thought Seungyeop was about to cry, so I quickly went over and patted his head. “Get a grip. It's natural that things don't go well sometimes. You didn't use the active skill in the first place, and now, I'll call it 'Heavenly Luck' from now on. 
 
 You didn't use Heavenly Luck anyway, you just picked it randomly.” I tried to comfort him in a low voice. Seungyeop was still trembling. Jincheol came over and added. “It's not your fault, Seungyeop.  Would it have been safe if someone else had chosen it?” Eunsol came over. “Everyone, stay alert! More than that, I think I know what's going on. When you move through a door, a new house appears. The new house has the same elements, but only one thing is different. There's a monster in that one different thing. Right?” 
 
 “And it seems like they give us a little time before the monster attacks. It's never attacked right away.” Songyi, who was listening, replied. “Is it a kind of ‘spot the difference’? Find the wrong picture within the time limit?” Mookseong muttered regretfully. 
 
 “This time, we did find the wrong picture. The only mistake was that we didn't shoot the TV as soon as we found it. Didn't the monster disappear immediately when we just blasted the display with a pistol?”  “Let's shoot the wrong part immediately next time.” Songyi made a radical suggestion. “Instead of looking one by one, how about we just enter the house and destroy everything around it with a rifle?” Mookseong immediately countered. 
 
 “Songyi, you're holding a rifle, not a missile. It takes a lot longer than you think to shoot and destroy every object in the house one by one, and, crucially, we don't have enough bullets. But the idea of destroying everything in sight is good. I've had this uncomfortable feeling all along that we're playing by the enemy's rules.”  
 
 He agrees with the idea of destroying the house, but wants to use a different method than a rifle. Elizabeth has been wandering somewhere since the beginning.  Cha Jincheol, noticing this, rushed over. “Let's destroy everything in sight with the star. Knock that woman out or something.” 
 
 “It's fine to just leave her be. Doesn't she seem to not be pushing us after seeing Mookseong using the remote control? She seems to think we’re supernatural beings. More importantly, isn't there a time limit on the star?” 
 
 “Time limit? Ah, it's true that I can't handle it for too long. But I think this house will collapse before my body does.” Songyi replied, looking uneasy. “Isn't it true that there isn't just one house? What if there is a house even after we leave?” Mookseong replied as if he had been waiting for this.  
 
 “If you move through the paths prepared in the house, such as the front door, the back door, and the underground door, another house will appear. But if we destroy the house with the star and ‘create a door’ to get out, will another house appear then? I don't think so. I think we can get out of this stage that the enemies prepared.” 
 
 It seems Mookseong and Jincheol agree on the idea of destroying the house with the star.  I understood the logic. Moving through the paths prepared within the house itself is an act of playing into the enemy's hands, so let's destroy the house and move outside of their intentions. However, they are overlooking one fact. “There's an opponent in the cursed room.  Normally, we have to fight and eliminate that being.  Right now, that opponent hasn't appeared yet.  If the opponent hasn't appeared yet, and after Jincheol uses the star, which has a time limit, for a long time to destroy things, and then the opponent appears, we might be wiped out helplessly.” Eunsol also joined in. 
 
 “Agreed. Don't forget that Gain, who has the Reinforcement, has disappeared.  The star and Jincheol are 90% of our fighting force.  It's dangerous to waste all our strength on destruction. And this is just my thought.” Eunsol briefly turned her head to check Elizabeth's location and spoke.  “If we could destroy the house with the star and solve the problem, they would have sealed Jincheol in the first place, not Gain.  The fact that Jincheol wasn't sealed itself proves that we can't solve this problem by just destroying everything, right?”  
 
 Silence fell for a moment.  There are those who want to destroy the house with the star, and those who think it's not a good idea. Cha Jincheol, who almost always agrees with Eunsol's opinion, changed his opinion.  “Let’s do it as Noona said.  However, let’s talk about it again after we somehow escape.” Cha Jincheol didn't seem genuinely convinced.  It seems like he doesn't want to directly oppose Eunsol's opinion right now because she has a strong voice among us in this dangerous place. He strongly expressed his opinion of talking about it again after we leave.  Anyway...  Elizabeth has been acting strangely since the beginning.  Songyi was also puzzled. “What’s she been doing all this time? It's like she's giving us time to talk comfortably, as if she's caring for us.”  I had a different thought. What if this woman is not taking care of us, but has her own plans?  From Elizabeth's point of view, we are the ones who are taking care of her by talking amongst ourselves.  My head is getting more and more complicated.  There are many factors to consider.  I suddenly missed that clumsy guy. 

**To be continued.**
