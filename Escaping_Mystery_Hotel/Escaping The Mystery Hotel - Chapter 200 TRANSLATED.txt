## Chapter 199 – Party Time – Ninth Companion (1)

**Date:** 95th Day

**Current Location:** 2nd Floor, Snow Globe Snowy Plain

**Sage's Advice:** X

— While reminiscing about his experience in the Labyrinth of Han Gain, Yan Jianyue checked his status window and discovered that his location was listed as "Snow Globe Snowy Plain." The snowy region didn't have a specific name yesterday, but now it does? What does this mean? He shook off his thoughts and returned to his worries about the Labyrinth.

"Sister."

"Yes. Done with your worries?"

"Thinking back, the 'Labyrinth' we've seen so far can actually be categorized into three types. Type 1: Regressed Infant Labyrinth. Type 2: Middle School Labyrinth. Type 3: Adult Labyrinth."

"The descriptions are a bit strange, but you're right when you divide them that way. Type 1 is the Labyrinth who went insane after making Ari, Type 2 is the childhood Labyrinth who was in the Labyrinth's Hell, and Type 3 is the Labyrinth who entered the hotel after spending a long time at the Bureau. Something like that?"

"Type 1 doesn't require any consideration since everyone opposes his revival. Even Ari said she won't revive him until she finds a way to restore his sanity. Having a low intelligence level like a child is dangerous, even more so than a villain. It means he's an unpredictable kind of person."

"That's right. Even if he was a villain, at least if he was somewhat calculating, cooperation for the common goal of escaping the hotel would be possible. But a child is hopeless."

"Type 2 is probably a Labyrinth we won't meet again. Ultimately, we need to decide about Type 3, but no one has actually met Type 3."

"That's true."

"Let me tell you about Type 2 I've met. Honestly, I didn't think he was a villain at all."

"Don't tell me you think that way because he was pretty?"

He flinched momentarily. It would be a lie to say he didn't get influenced by looks when evaluating people.

"It's absolutely not the case."

"How can 'maybe' and 'absolutely' exist in the same sentence?"

"It's not a joke. I didn't feel any viciousness or extreme selfishness. It might sound strange, but excluding the fact that he has a strange supernatural ability, he seemed like a normal girl in her age group with a playful nature."

"Then wouldn't he still not be an extreme villain even after becoming an adult?"

"That's unknown. However…"

"However?"

"Let's consider the circumstances. When Labyrinth regained consciousness temporarily, he asked why he had received the 'Justice' blessing."

"Blessings are somewhat related to our own personalities…"

"A psychopath can't receive 'Justice'. Moreover, the Labyrinth who was in the Bureau seems to have been a high-ranking official."

"It's hard for someone who's insane or wicked to the point of crossing the line to become a high-ranking official of an organization that protects the world. Okay. I understand your opinion. But, this doesn't seem to be a reason to change our original order."

"The first revival is the doctor?"

"Yes. Of course, we have many questions about the doctor, Kim Sang-hyun. We don't know if he's a good person or someone who will cooperate. In a way, we know even less about him than Labyrinth."

"But unlike Labyrinth, he has a big advantage."

"He's not someone who's hard to control. Since he's not from the 'Bureau,' he doesn't pose a risk of splitting our party. Ari and Grandpa Muksung might be lenient towards Labyrinth, but not the doctor. In the worst case, we can just kill him and consider the ticket wasted. However, what if he has hidden strength?"

The idea of killing him if necessary came up naturally in the conversation… It's strange, but we're not ordinary people anymore.

"Speaking of which…"

"What?"

"Don't we know little about the doctor's abilities? We assume he has healing powers, but we don't know how it works or if he has any legacies."

"That's right."

"Why don't we just ask the Guide?"

"…"

"I realized this just now, but the knowledge we have about the adult Labyrinth, such as his three legacies and being a former Justice holder, was all told by the Guide."

"I asked him. I forgot. Because this hotel keeps hiding things, we've developed the bad habit of worrying about things even when we could just ask. You two go and ask him."

* Fortunately, the Party Time wasn't over yet, so the portal leading to Hanbing Hell was still accessible. Yan Jianyue, his brother, and Ari who naturally joined them, opened the faintly hidden portal in one corner of Christmas Hall and entered Hanbing Hell again.

"It looked like you two were talking in the snowy plain. Have you decided who to revive?"

"We'll ultimately decide through a meeting."

"If you two decide, I doubt anyone else will object. The candidates are either the doctor or Labyrinth, and I haven't even met them. You're the only one who has met both of them."

"I don't really consider it meeting the doctor. It was just his voice echoing in my head."

As he spoke, something came to mind.

"Come to think of it, Ari, you've been treated by the doctor, haven't you?"

"Yes, it was when I received a gun from a merchant in exchange for my arms and legs."

"Did the doctor give you any message?"

"No."

"Hmm… I suspected you might know the doctor."

"Why use the word 'suspect'? And I don't know him. I've never even seen his face."

"If the doctor knew you, wouldn't he have said something? Or, didn't the doctor exist in your first party?"

After a moment of contemplation, Ari answered.

"I vaguely remember someone 'being' there who was unusual. It was a passing comment, and I didn't ask more."

"An unusual person?"

"He was said to be from a special forces unit and also a medical school graduate."

"Amazing."

"He was also a candidate for an astronaut."

"Is he human? Not a manga character?"

"Surprisingly, he's human. The problem is that I've never met him."

He's never met him. Hearing that, he remembered something Ari said before. She said her first party disbanded due to internal conflict before they reached the 2nd Floor, and two people died. Since Ari was born on the 2nd Floor, she would have never met those who died before reaching it.

"I heard that the people in your first party were high-spec, but they're really incredible."

"It must be someone else from the doctor. The person I remember was named Johnny? He doesn't seem to be Asian. At the very least, it wasn't Kim Sang-hyun."

"It must be a different person. After all, if he was from special forces and an astronaut candidate, wouldn't he have mentioned that when asking me for revival?"

Hearing that, Ari suddenly tilted her head. Jincheol coughed lightly to change the mood.

"Do you remember what I said during the meeting?"

"Brother said we should just save the tickets."

"What do you think now? I still think we should just save them for ourselves."

"I considered that possibility, but given the hotel's nature, isn't it either annihilation or survival for all in the cursed rooms? It's hard for a situation to arise where only one of us dies and we revive them."

"The danger isn't limited to the cursed rooms."

"But, the cursed rooms are over 90% of the danger."

"…"

"Besides, we need to consider the opportunity cost. Saving the ticket isn't risk-free. It means giving up the power boost from a new companion. That opportunity cost is a kind of risk. Wouldn't a higher risk of annihilation in the cursed room due to weaker power be a bigger danger?"

Jincheol nodded, then didn't bring up the topic again. 

We were now a little more familiar with Hanbing Hell, and as we waited, listening to the faint screams as a welcoming greeting, a drone descended from the sky.

"Participants! Have you decided where to use your tickets?"

"Before that, I have a question."

"Ask away."

"Can I ask about Kim Sang-hyun? I'm talking about the 'doctor' who appears when you're injured in the hotel."

"What do you want to know about former participant Kim Sang-hyun?"

"Firstly, Kim Sang-hyun is a former participant, but also a hidden NPC of the hotel. If we revive him, what happens to the hidden NPC? Even if we have a healer among us, we still need medical support from the hotel. Kim Sang-hyun himself could get hurt."

"There's no need to worry about that. After Kim Sang-hyun's revival, another person will be assigned as the hotel's direct doctor."

"Kim Sang-hyun's… What kind of healing power does he have? Can we know about it?"

"Are you curious about his blessing?"

"Is his healing power a blessing? Then, what about his legacies?"

"He is a participant who hasn't obtained any legacies."

Jincheol muttered as if he were disappointed.

"No legacies. It's a bit of a shame, isn't it?"

"Let's hear more. We expected he wouldn't be a strong fighter from the beginning."

Ari chuckled.

"Labyrinth is a problem because he's strong. If he was too strong, it would be a problem, so not having legacies is a good thing in a way."

"Explain about the blessing."

"Former participant Kim Sang-hyun. His blessing during his survival was 'Diligence'. Currently, there is no owner of 'Diligence', so he will regain 'Diligence' after revival."

"Diligence? What kind of blessing is it?"

"Rixin Yourixin (日新又日新)! It is the duty of a person to constantly hone themselves and become a more valuable being every day. However, unfortunately, it is also a reality that high achievements cannot be achieved through effort alone."

??? Yan Jianyue and his brother were both stunned. What's with this sudden tone? It's not the Guide's tone.

"No matter how diligent a being is, if they lack the aptitude, it is difficult to achieve great things. Blessing, 'Diligence', is the power that allows one to overcome that limitation! Those who constantly hone themselves to cultivate will also gain corresponding aptitude. "

They listened dumbfounded and quickly replied.

"So, it's a blessing that makes people geniuses?"

"Child. You only understand half the meaning of my blessing. It's not a power that simply turns the owner into a genius. If you constantly strive to cultivate, pulverizing your bones and shattering your body with a commitment to diligence every day, you will surely achieve great things. That is the essence of my blessing. Rewards for those who strive. Understand?"

The being who was using the Guide's speaker was, unbelievably, the Patron of 'Diligence'!

"It was you, Patron. I understand. Can I ask one more question?"

"Ask away."

"What kind of person is Kim Sang-hyun?"

Suddenly, the Guide fell silent for a moment before speaking.

"… I thought you'd ask about the blessing, but you suddenly asked about the participant. Are you being clever? You strangely resemble the Owl."

"I apologize if I offended you."

"He was a very diligent person, one of the most diligent mortals I know. Also, he was not a villain, at least."

With those words, the Patron stopped using the Guide's speaker.
