## Chapter 179 – Party Time – The Most Ominous One (6)

**Date:** Day 90
**Current Location:** Floor 1, Room 105 – Room of Rest
**Sage’s Advice:** 3

Elena hurried away to the Safari, and shortly after, Ari appeared. “What are you thinking about?”

“Oh, Elena just told me something very significant.”

“Hmm. She told me something weird too.”

“You met her already?”

“A while ago. She said the Patron said something strange.”

“What did he say?”

“He said something like the cold-related problem is not Elena’s concern. And… he also heard other things about you. He even asked me about them.”

Ari finished her sentence, staring at me with a smirk. “What do you mean?”

“Nothing.”

“How can it be nothing? You definitely have something to say.”

“It really is nothing.”

I feel like I’m being teased!  For some reason, I felt like headbutting her again, so I got into position.  Ari looked at me with a dumbfounded expression. Luckily, before I could act, the others came towards the dining table.

“Good morning!”

“Did you sleep well?”

Breakfast started with light greetings.

The first topic of conversation was naturally Elena. My sister asked curiously, “So, Elena told you something meaningful this morning and then left for the Safari?”

“Yes. She seems to be creating something ‘evil yet capable of communication.’ I’m not sure what kind of monster she’s making.”

Ari seemed unconcerned. “She’ll figure it out. It’s the Safari anyway. Even Pero can’t enter the Safari, so won’t the monsters Elena creates be the same? I don’t think we need to worry about that.”

“What do you mean?”

“I mean that even if Elena creates strange, failed monsters in the Safari, those failed creations won’t be able to leave the Safari. The Safari’s exterior and interior are separated like different worlds.  It’s like only our hotel participants can come and go.”

Song Yi looked puzzled. “Then, even if she creates a successful one, she won’t be able to bring it out?”

“Hmm… Elena probably considered that. Maybe she has her own method.”

I have a slight idea about it. “Perhaps, once she creates a successful one, she can create another with the same feel outside?”

Now that I say it, I’m curious.  Even Beatrice, who was skilled in her ability, couldn’t keep creating successful ones.  Of course, the ability itself seems to be subtly changed by the hotel, and the users are different, so we can’t assume that the logic applied to Beatrice also applies to Elena.

The talk about Elena’s ability development ended.  The topic shifted to everyone’s top concern – the hotel getting colder.  My sister summarized the information she found out yesterday.

“Apparently, after Party Time ends, we have to go to a place called ‘Hanbing Hell,’ which doesn’t seem ordinary. We have to do something there to fix things.”

“That’s right.  Should we use the advice for Hell?”

“Let’s talk about it some more amongst ourselves. I thought about it all night, and the notification we saw yesterday was not ordinary.”

My sister stood up for a moment and wrote the notification on the whiteboard.

/Would you like to open the door to Hanbing Hell?  Party Time will end as soon as the door opens./

“Yesterday, we only focused on the first word, ‘Hanbing Hell.’ But thinking about it, the last part, ‘Party Time will end,’ also seems unusual.  What do you think it means?”

“It still says Party Time is ongoing.”

“Yes. We’re already freezing to death, and the second floor is already a hell that surpasses the Arctic, but the hotel is saying ‘Party Time is still ongoing.’  In other words…”

Hearing this far, Grandpa said with a lament, “It means they’ll start seriously messing with us after Party Time ends.  For the hotel, this is just like a warm-up!”

“Let’s all stay calm. Party Time hasn’t ended yet, right?  At least on the first floor, it’s just a bit unpleasant. Like this.”

With the words ‘like this,’ she picked up the mysterious pork cutlet with only the inside frozen.

Ari said with a slightly worried expression, “A terrible scenario popped into my head. It’s because of a past experience.”

“Experience?”

“Right now, only the second floor is a hopeless hell, and the first floor is mostly intact. If the hotel really wants to torture us, wouldn’t they turn the first floor into a freezer?”

Seungyeop answered with a gloomy tone, “Why would they want to torture us in the first place?”

“That’s a good point. I’ll make sure to ask Owl about that later when I grab him by the collar. Any other questions?”

“Of course, we have to ask about that damn ‘Hanbing Hell.’”

In a short amount of time, questions piled up. We decided to ask right away.

First question:  ‘Will the first floor become strange after Party Time ends?’

We already had a hunch about the answer, so we asked to confirm.  Owl answered with a clear response, unlike his usual cryptic nature.  However, the content made me curse immediately.

“Damn it, it’s true!”

“What’s true?”

“The hotel system is mostly going to shut down.  Obviously, Room 105 is going to go kaput too.”

“This is really -”

A barrage of curses followed for a while.  Even though I secretly guessed it, knowing for sure made me angry.  Aside from being angry, I had an idea when I heard the phrase ‘there are benefits too.’

“Alright, alright, listen to me for a moment. It says there are benefits for us when the hotel system stops. I think this is also a very clear meaning.”

My sister reacted immediately. “The Cursed Room also stops?”

“That’s it. Of the hotel systems that stop, the Cursed Room is obviously the one that benefits us.”

“What the hell is it trying to do by stopping the Cursed Room?”

“I’ll ask the second question.”

Second question:  ‘Tell me about Hanbing Hell.’

Instead of an answer, a notification popped up.

“…It seems there are other cases where we use all 3 of the advice slots besides questions about Room 104.”

“What?  We have to use all three? Then it won’t answer now?”

“That’s right.  I guess this is another kind of ‘crossing the line’ judgment. Let’s all think about other questions until lunchtime.  We have to use the remaining two before the day ends.”

Everyone felt a little disheartened and ended the morning meeting.  All we learned from the morning meeting was the ominous warning that the first floor will also go kaput after Party Time ends.

**Elena**

Woosh!  An enormous roar echoes from a distance, vibrating the entire ground.  What kind of creature is making this sound?  Has a creature like this ever existed on Earth? According to the notification that popped up as soon as I entered the Safari, it’s now 330 million years ago, possibly the Permian or Carboniferous period.

Buzz! Shiriririk!  I turn my head around in a daze, and a huge dragonfly-like insect, as big as my head, flies by. If it were me before experiencing the hotel, I wouldn’t have stopped screaming at the sight of a bug that big.  But the hotel has long turned me into a completely different person.  It’s been a few months since I started seeing corpses and monsters every day like it’s nothing.  To be honest, now, even next to some monsters, I can swallow my food without a problem.  It’s past time to be screaming at a big ‘mere’ dragonfly -

“AAAAAH!!!”

Oh, crap! A cockroach the size of a puppy is crossing the line!  Technically, it’s an ancestor of a cockroach, but still!  I was so startled that I ran 30 meters before calming down.

While leaning against a tree or whatever it is, catching my breath, I felt ‘something’ brush against my back.  I simply rubbed myself against the tree to shake it off.  I decided not to check what it was.  

Should I say I’m lucky?  Aside from the giant, roaring creature in the distance, most of the creatures are just large insects.  It’s still very creepy, but it’s just an insect, and even at its biggest, it’s just puppy-sized.  I haven’t seen anything that could eat me.

After walking for about 10 minutes, I finally saw a lake.  This is the place I was looking for.

“Will it work?  What do you think, Gain?”

Of course, there’s no one here to answer me.  The lake isn’t very clean.  Strange creatures float around everywhere.  In the past, wouldn’t I have hated even looking at them?

I take off my coat, take off my shoes, and lower my skirt….  Wearing only a light negligee, I submerge half my body in the lake.

“This is the beginning.”

The jar tilts.  The ominous aura that filled my soul spreads outwards like wildfire. In an instant, silence falls over the world.  The water bugs in the lake, the dragonflies in the sky, the centipedes crawling on the ground – all of them scramble away from me in a panic.

**Splash!**

What is the power called ‘ominous imagination’? Gain explained, based on the memory of the chief researcher, that it’s the power to make the anxieties we feel during our daily lives into reality.  The Patron also warned that if you use this power properly, you’re likely to go crazy.  Leaving aside this superficial information, what exactly is ‘ominous imagination’? 

I feel the power boiling inside me like a volcano and think.  This power is simply the power to bring trauma into reality!  Beatrice’s ability evolved in a way that strangely mutated nearby objects or created monstrously enhanced versions of real animals because she awakened her power as a child.  Do you remember the childhood she spent trembling in fear every night?  When you turn off the lights and lie in bed, you feel like the doll is staring at you strangely, and whenever the wind makes the windows rattle, you feel like someone is going to attack you from outside.  All of these ominous imaginations became the source of Beatrice’s power.

But I’m different from her childhood.  My trauma is different from Beatrice’s, which was created by a vague fear of all things in the world.  My trauma… is based on ‘real experiences.’  

Aha! Now I understand the Patron’s warning. I feel it deep in my bones – why ominous imagination is inherently a power like insanity.  

I feel the presence of a man in a black suit behind me, relentlessly chasing after me. I hear the sound of the old woman who sold radishes this morning snitching on me and my family. The moment I get out of bed and go into the living room, I see a vision of my father with blood coming out of his mouth.  

Just as the hell I created myself fills my mind and I’m about to go insane, the embodiment of all the ominous things rises from the depths. 

The presence resembled the man in a suit who chased after my family in my childhood.  The presence resembles the kind-looking old lady in the market who snitched on us.  The presence resembles the familiar maid who poisoned my father’s teacup.  

Beyond all these nightmares – the presence resembles a girl who laughed at me like it was a joke even when I fought with all my might, crushing her body and splitting her head open. 

“Hello?”

**Whoosh!**

The hand that rose from the water pierced my stomach in a single instant.  I couldn’t even scream from the unbearable pain. As my body cooled, the monster’s body began to disintegrate.  The monster made strange noises, not understanding why it was disintegrating. 

Just recklessly killing someone in front of me?  … You’re a failure. You’re a bad kid. It’s okay…. It’s okay…. It’s nothing. I’ll remake you.  I’ll make you over and over again, over and over.  Until you become a good kid who listens to me.
