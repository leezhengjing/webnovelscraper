## Chapter 150 – Rest and Reorganization (6) – Eunsol

“Habitual Secret Making Syndrome?…. Are you worried I’ll hide the meeting from you like my sister?”

Aeri was upset because I planned to have a meeting without her. This was the kind of thing that shouldn’t be known. I had nothing to say to her, so I mixed her a cocktail and handed it to her.

“Here, drink this.”

After taking a sip, Aeri’s expression softened slightly.

“When I first saw the ticket, it was hard to bear. It felt like the realization of a long-held dream was approaching. If I had held this meeting on the first day of our vacation, I wouldn’t have acted as extreme as you all expected. I thought about it for a few days.”

“Did your thoughts change after thinking about it alone?”

“A realistic reason came to mind. Whether Miro can actually avoid causing trouble.”

Miro doesn’t even trust her daughter, Aeri. Revival is a little…

“Just asking, but the person who you said was the one who monopolized the inheritance -”

“One of them is Miro. You all already know, right?”

“…”

“But I’ll defend that part a little. It’s not just Miro, but a story that applies to all the party members back then. They weren’t evil people from the start when they were in society. They were also exposed to the harsh environment of the hotel, and once one or two people started acting selfishly, their unity collapsed and they fell apart.”

“A sane Miro wouldn’t act selfishly if he joined our party now?”

“Yes. Of course, it’s just my belief. After all, I’ve never met a sane Miro.”

Aeri’s words felt emptier than ever. As I listened, I started to wonder.

“Since we’re talking about inheritance, if Miro were to revive, would he revive with all the inheritance he had in life?”

“I wonder about that too. Actually, it’s a story that applies to other revival targets besides Miro. How much of their power from their lives will be maintained after their revival? Will their blessings be the same as before? If we revive Estavio, will he revive with his bracelet? Will the Doctor revive with the healing power he had as an NPC?”

“It’s hard to say whether their abilities, which are our judgment criteria, will be maintained after their revival. It’s something we can’t know at this point.”

“There are many secrets to revival. A significant portion of the secrets will be revealed when we finally get to the Revival Chamber. We’ll have to discuss it again then.”

“Let’s go back to Miro. I heard his mental state isn’t normal now.”

“That’s right. That’s why he’s not suitable as the first revival target. We need to find another way.”

“Another way?”

A fire was rekindled within the empty Aeri. Her tone changed.

“Miro went crazy while creating me and became a child. The place where I was born. My starting point. That place. There must be a way to restore Miro there.  Reviving Miro won’t have any meaning until we find that method.”

“The place where you were born. You don’t know where it is?”

“I don’t. The only person who could explain it was a child when I was born. What kind of room, what kind of power, was it that allowed Miro to create me alone?”

…That seems to be Aeri’s plan. Reviving Miro, who has lost his intelligence due to some unknown event, would be quite burdensome for his daughter, Aeri. As Aeri said, if she’s not by Miro’s side 24 hours a day, she can’t stop him from doing strange things. So, her plan is to revive him only after finding a way to restore his intelligence. Now I understand why Aeri backed down so easily before.

And another question arose.

How in the world did Miro create Aeri all by himself? A secret room with an unknown purpose? Mysterious superpowers? I don’t know. It’s shocking, but this hotel has too many hidden secrets.

After offering another cocktail, I moved on to the next topic.

“What do you think of my eyes now?”

“Tell me honestly?”

“Yes.”

“Honestly, they’re a bit scary.”

“Honestly, they’re ugly. Well, it’s okay that they’ve become ugly in appearance. I wasn’t unprepared for that. What I’m worried about is recovering after leaving the hotel. Honestly, I didn’t know such a big change would occur. It feels like I’ve ground my bones and implanted a giant eyeball. Can the Administration even treat this?”

Aeri tilted her head in confusion for a moment, then slapped her knee.

“Aha! I think you misunderstood a little?”

“Just talk casually. You keep changing your tone, making things even more confusing. Misunderstood?”

“Normal people don’t realize that human eyeballs are bigger than they think. The visible eye size isn’t the size of the entire eyeball, but only a part around the pupil. Giant eyeball? Are you thinking that your new eyes are about 1.5 times bigger than your original eyes?”

“It wasn’t 1.5 times, but I thought they were 1.3 times bigger.”

“Think about it easily. There’s no room inside the human skull to fit extra parts. If a specific part of the body suddenly grows by 30%, there’s no space for it. To fit it, you’d have to do surgery on the level of body modification.”

“Are you saying the eyeballs themselves haven’t gotten bigger?”

“It seems like they’ve gotten slightly bigger. I can’t be sure until I take them out. But they haven’t grown by 30% or anything. The reason why your eyes look bigger now is a different problem than the size change of the eyeball itself.”

“Are you saying more of them are exposed?”

“That’s right.  You are, metaphorically speaking, in a state similar to someone who has undergone excessive double eyelid surgery.  Normally, even with double eyelid surgery, people’s eyes look about 10-20% bigger.  It’s not that the size of your right eyeball itself has increased by 30%, but that the exposed part of the eyeball has increased by about 30%.  So, you can get it fixed when you go outside.”

I’m glad they didn’t grind my skull. But the fact that it’s fundamentally ugly hasn’t changed.

“What about the things outside, but can’t we at least make them less ugly for now? Of course, the Merchant said the hotel can’t recover the losses caused by the eyes, but -”

“That means you can’t recover the real eyes. You want them to be less ugly, so I think you can recover them. But -”

“But?”

“Why did the Doctor do such an ugly procedure in the first place?”

“…”

“Don’t close your eyes. Stay still.”

With those words, Aeri grabbed my face with both hands and approached me. Her mysterious pupils, as if lit with burning flames, stared into my eyes. In response, my eyes pierced through Aeri’s, observing each blood vessel on the surface of the eyeball.

“Your eyes are amazing. They’re really amazing.  What kind of telescope structure is it? There are three small lenses, like dots, surrounding the pupil.”

“My eyes are pretty unique.”

Aeri moved away again and continued.

“The Doctor wouldn’t have increased the exposure of your eyeballs for fun or to torment you. He did it because he needed to.  It seems like he needed to expose all three lenses around the pupil to the outside.”

“So, there’s nothing I can do?”

“That’s all I can say. But I understand you wanting to make them less ugly.  If we revive the Doctor someday, you can ask him directly if he can improve the surgery.”

The eye consultation is over.  It’s strange, but the idea of reviving the Doctor is getting stronger.  If he’s the one who performed the procedure on my eyes, wouldn’t it be possible for him to change them to be less ugly?  Until then, I should try to live my daily life with an eye patch.  Another day has come to an end.


## – Han Gain

Can she succeed? Last night, after finishing the discussion, I used the advice I received and got a useful attack method! I understood the theory, but I couldn’t guarantee anything before actually trying it.  Who should I ask to try it on?

While thinking and wandering around, Aeri approached from afar.

“What are you doing? You’re spinning around like a kid.”

Is this fate? This is perfect.

“Actually, I’ve been diligently asking about teleportation using advice for the past few days.”

“It seems you’ve gotten a good answer. You seem pretty happy.”

“Yes. I got quite a few detailed advice. Some of them were about new attack methods.”

“New attack methods?”

Heh heh. Look at that expectant expression on Aeri’s face! She must be wanting to see this too.  The thought of testing it out already made me happy.

“Watch carefully! I’m going to show you.  Be careful.”

“You’re not going to -”

– Woosh!  Thud!

The feeling of my whole body being pulled back.  It felt like someone was grabbing me with a giant hand, a rather unpleasant feeling. Then, my position instantly shifted.

– Crash!

Aeri was instantly bounced off the wall!

“How is it? Isn’t it amazing? This technique came from a simple idea – what if my coordinates and the opponent’s coordinates overlap during teleportation?  Owl provided more details. If the positions overlap, the one with less mass will be bounced back. Just looking at it like this -”

While I was explaining, Aeri got up.

“That’s an amazing technique. I’ll show you my new technique too.”

Aeri suddenly floated up into the air, flew towards me, and hit my body, sending me flying.

– Whiz! Bang!

The impact of hitting the wall so strongly made it hard to breathe for a while.

“…”

“This is my new technique. I have the power to hit people with my fists and send them flying.”

Silence fell upon the room for a while.  Aeri sighed and opened her mouth.

“So, what’s the principle? If the coordinates overlap, the lighter one will be bounced back?”

“That’s the basic principle.  But, it was something I didn’t know, but after teleportation, my mass is judged to be much heavier than usual. To be exact, the principle of teleportation -”

“Forget it! What’s the point of explaining the principles of a power only you can use?  You’re a know-it-all! The point is that you can blow away almost anyone with that ‘overlapping teleportation’.”

Aeri seemed a bit angry.

“Right.”

“Did you ask about revival?”

“I asked once, but they said they couldn’t tell me anymore. They told me ‘Don’t get ahead of yourself.’  I think telling me that tickets can also be obtained on the second floor was the limit of what they could tell me.”

“Advice has its limits. They wouldn’t answer questions like ‘Tell me about the origin of the hotel.’”

“Our week of vacation is almost over.  It’s a shame that tomorrow is the end.”

Aeri counted something on her fingers for a moment before answering.

“You’ve gained quite a bit of skill in teleportation, and you’ve decided how to handle the protective suit, you’ve used the Hand of Greed, and you’ve talked about revival. It seems like you’ve done everything you needed to do. Will the second floor open at midnight tomorrow? Or tomorrow morning?  Let’s go up as soon as it opens.”

“It’s a shame that the Sanctuary of Blessings isn’t open.  I feel like there were people who could have strengthened their blessings with the contribution points they earned in the Gatekeeper’s Room.”

“Well, the Sanctuary of Blessings is only open during ‘Party Time’.”

“Can we return to the first floor after the second floor opens?  I doubt we can’t use the Sanctuary of Blessings after entering the second floor.”

“I was able to return to the first floor in my time. But the hotel is always changing. There are many parts that are different from my memories now.”

“Eunsol unni seems to be ordering various things.”

“You need to start preparing for the second floor.  Mentally or whatever.”

There were no other major events during the rest of our vacation.  The next morning, after our seven-day vacation was over, a notification appeared on the hotel’s display. 

/Dear valued guests, greetings! The second floor of Hotel Pioneer is finally open! Congratulations to all of you who have overcome various trials and reached the second stage. New challenges and new treasures await you. Please proceed to the elevator. + Note: The second floor is poorly heated. Please be aware that it may be a little cold./
