## Chapter 159 – Room 201, The Cursed Room – ‘The Cube’ (8)

**Date:** Day 82
**Current Location:** Floor 1, Room 105, The Rest Room
**Sage’s Advice:** 1]

– Gained had spent a long time brainstorming ways to safely enter the ‘Research Lab Route.’ Eunsol suggested becoming transparent using the badge’s power and checking it out. Jinchul wanted to close his eyes and run like crazy. Other suggestions included Song-i’s belief that the bracelet’s mental protection would work, Ari’s willingness to endure a large blood expenditure, and more. Some unusual ideas included wearing white coats like the researchers or, even more drastically, removing eyeballs from the inside.  Despite the diverse ideas, we reached one conclusion: there was no way to know if it would work until we actually tried it. Since we didn't know what the source of the madness was, there was no other option. 

As the conversation flowed, Eunsol offered a different perspective.
"Let's split the party."
"What? What do you mean?"
"We discussed this before. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. When facing something extremely dangerous with potential death as the consequence of failure, diversification is key. What if we all enter the TV, and all the methods we've thought of don’t work? That would be a massacre."

The logic in her statement was undeniable. It was unnecessary for everyone to enter a route where ‘death on failure’ was practically guaranteed.
"So, some will go through the TV's research lab route, and the others will continue with the original plan?" Song-i asked with a dazed expression.
"Did we have an original plan?"
"We didn’t explicitly decide, but securing an escape route is usually our plan. Based on what I’ve heard, here’s the gist. We progress through various rooms within the cube. If we find a room with an escape route, we stop. We wait in that room, and eventually, a ‘Move!’ notification appears on a mirror somewhere. That mirror leads to the escape route, and it’s also the location where the demon girl waits."
Grandpa Mookseong reached a conclusion.
"Let's conserve as much energy as possible to reach that location and face the demon. One of us will escape while we fight."

Jinchul seemed uneasy.
"To secure the escape route, we have to fight the demon, right? If we have to fight, isn't it unsafe to split our forces, with some going to the research lab route?"

Eunsol replied with a slightly bitter tone.
"Well, people with lower combat strength can go to the lab route. Honestly, will I be of much help against the demon girl who appears from the mirror? Nabi probably wouldn’t be of much use either.  Honestly, her weapons have clear weaknesses."

Song-i became curious.
"Nabi has weaknesses? I was impressed by her one-shot knockdown of the gorilla."

Eunsol chuckled and summoned Nabi by opening her brooch.
"Whooooosh!" Nabi couldn’t maintain her balance, as if caught in a typhoon when Eunsol blew air from her mouth.
"See? It's just an insect in the end. It can’t even get close with just a breath of air. Back then, the gorilla, for some reason, had a surge of sensitivity and stretched its hand slowly, so it got hit."

Grandpa Mookseong said something similar.
"I agree. Since she handles guns like BB pellets, I’m not much use against that girl either."

The four of them, Jinchul who possesses a star, Ari who utilizes ancient blood, Song-i with her bracelet, and Elena with her righteousness, seemed capable of facing the demon. Seungyeop seemed unable to participate in combat, but he would be ideal for securing the escape route while the four of them fought.

We divided the party into the ‘Research Lab Party’ (Eunsol, Mookseong), who enter the TV halfway, and the ‘Escape Party’ (Ari, Seungyeop, Elena, Song-i, Jinchul), who continue deeper into the cube, fight the demon girl, and secure the escape. 

A sense of inadequacy crept in regarding the party going to the lab side, which is related to my seal being undone.  Their absence of Song-i, Ari, etc., who have resistance to madness, was also a point of regret.  But there was no other choice. Since it was a matter of life and death, the team placed a much higher priority on securing the escape. I understood their feelings.

Ultimately, the discussion regarding how to proceed with the second attempt came to an end.
"Anyone else want to say anything?"

…Actually, yes. Since yesterday, I’ve been listening to the team’s progress from a third-person perspective. Maybe it’s because I was listening from a distance, but there were points that made me think, ‘This is not right.’ Even though it’s due to the hotel's seal, I’m unable to actively participate, and it feels uncomfortable to criticize those who’ve been fighting their hearts out while I’m sitting here. So, I simply passed yesterday. But this is a matter of life and death, isn’t it? I ultimately felt the need to speak up. However, I should consider the advice Ari gave me before. 
"I have something to say. Before that… Seungyeop?"
"Yes?"
"Sorry, can you step outside for a bit? I want to talk about something related to your blessing."

It’s best if Seungyeop remains unaware of the story regarding luck. Seungyeop knew this, so he left without a second word.

Everyone’s curious gazes gathered on me.
"You probably didn’t notice it since you were participating, but I wasn’t involved at all and heard your reports, and I noticed some issues."

Eunsol seemed to already enjoy this.
"This feels good. Usually, you have to take a step back to see certain issues."
"Thank you. Don’t you think everyone relies too heavily on ‘luck’ in their progress? For example, the rooms we’ve identified so far are ‘Mimicry Room’, ‘꽝’, and ‘Escape Room’. What’s the method to distinguish these rooms? There definitely is one."
"There definitely is one. Because Elizabeth tricked us into the ‘꽝’ room."
"But, instead of searching for a method to differentiate rooms, it seems like you just told Seungyeop to guess. So, you were easily caught by Elizabeth’s bait."

Jinchul replied defensively.
"Well, we didn’t have much time to look around because after waiting in the room for a while, the ‘Move!’ notification appeared, urging us to move."

Ari also spoke.
"I took a moment to look. But I couldn’t see any differences. However, as you said, there must be a way to distinguish them. There has to be, because Elizabeth could trick us."

I offered a more proactive opinion.
"There are many other suspicious points. For example, is it true that rooms with an escape route and rooms without an escape route are clearly divided? Didn’t the word ‘Move!’ appear in the first room? Perhaps there was an escape route behind the mirror even in the first room, but we could’ve destroyed it. Yet, why do everyone take it for granted that there are limited rooms with an escape route?"

"Because Seungyeop guided us for a long time and then collapsed."

"That’s right. Seungyeop collapsed at the sixth or seventh room, and we even believed that collapse was a kind of choice, and Ari examined the mirror and found the escape route. However, isn’t this interpretation a bit too results-oriented? Maybe there was an escape route behind the mirror from the first room."

Everyone seemed to contemplate for a while. I spoke further.
"The interpretation about luck is too results-oriented. If even the collapse was a lucky choice, then wasn’t Seungyeop’s decision to choose the room faster before Elizabeth randomly chose it also a choice? But no one considers that a lucky choice."

Ari, who had been listening, replied.
"I get what you mean. You’re saying that we’re labeling all the events with good outcomes as ‘lucky choices’ and interpreting events with bad outcomes as ‘choices unrelated to luck’."
"Exactly. Because we interpret all the good outcomes as being part of a lucky design, we treat luck as an almost omnipotent ability, and our reliance on it grows stronger."

Grandpa Mookseong, who had been listening for a while, nodded.
"As I was listening, something came to mind. We only learned about the research lab behind the TV after escaping. If luck was truly an omnipotent ability, shouldn’t Seungyeop have acted in a way that hinted at something being inside the TV when choosing where to go next?"

Song-i replied with a pained expression.
"But when Seungyeop chose, he was actually avoiding the ‘꽝’ room with the absurd monster like the gorilla, right?"

"Of course, luck definitely played a role in that part. I’m not saying that luck is meaningless."

"Please explain it more simply."

"Let me put it this way. If you roll a die, the probability of rolling a 6 is usually 1/6. But Seungyeop boasted to us that he rolled a 6 almost 7 times out of 10 rolls. This is undoubtedly a supernatural phenomenon, a remarkable ability. However, it’s not 100%. Other numbers appeared more than 3 times."

"So, luck isn’t something to blindly trust, because it sometimes malfunctions?"
"It could be a malfunction, or it could be that it wasn’t working at all."

Ari let out a big sigh and summarized.
"I thought about this within the cube, but interpreting luck is tiring. From one perspective, it’s a powerful reality manipulation ability with an uncertain limit, and for someone like you who is skeptical, it’s a broken machine that malfunctions frequently."

"…"

"It’s a different topic, but now I understand why luck wasn’t given to you, Gain… It’s an ability that doesn’t suit an analytical person at all. Don’t tell Seungyeop about the content of this meeting. Analyzing from someone like you is harmful to Seungyeop, even if it’s just being conveyed."
"Am I some kind of radioactive substance?"

Unlike Ari, who seemed to subtly disagree with me, Eunsol took my side.
"Gain, your point is valid. For the second attempt, let’s not rely solely on Seungyeop’s guessing for the next room and find a way to distinguish them.  I think if we thoroughly beat Elizabeth, something will come out. At least she seemed to be able to differentiate rooms."

Eunsol’s simple conclusion regarding the lengthy meeting about luck was, ‘Let's beat Elizabeth properly.’ She seems to have been deeply traumatized by the gorilla, and her anger towards Elizabeth, who led everyone to the gorilla room, is also great.

After the morning meeting, Eunsol organized the plan on the whiteboard.

1.  Enter the cube and interrogate Elizabeth to obtain information.
2.  Proceed until we find the TV room. The Research Lab Party will enter the TV and explore the research lab.
3.  The Escape Party will proceed to the escape room. Seungyeop will escape from the escape room, and the rest will fight the demon girl.

"Anything else?"

I pondered what to ask as today’s final piece of advice. How to distinguish ‘꽝’ rooms inside the cube? Tips for breaking my seal? There are so many things I want to know, making it hard to choose.  Unlike me, who has many questions, my teammates clearly have something they’re curious about.
"Gain."
"Ah, Elena?"
"You have a remaining piece of advice, right? Ask for tips on how to deal with the demon."

Everyone nodded and looked at me. It’s strange, but there’s a definite difference between those who have experienced it directly and those who have only heard about it. Since yesterday, I’ve felt fear and suspicion towards the gorilla and demon girl in my teammates’ attitudes. I had naively assumed that since it was a human form, Elena could handle it with her righteousness.  Could it be that they’re thinking there’s a possibility she might lose even if she uses righteousness?
"Of course."

‘Please give me advice on how to deal with the demon girl behind the mirror.’

"…"

"What’s wrong?"

"You’re mentioning that proverb again. ‘견지망월’."

"Don’t focus on parts, but on the essence?"
"Something like that, yes."

We discussed various things regarding the final piece of advice and once again set off towards Room 201.  Seeing everyone tense, I feel tense myself. Will everything be okay? It’s my first time only supporting like this.  With a strange, parental feeling of sending my children to the college entrance exam, I mentally wished them well and the second attempt began.
