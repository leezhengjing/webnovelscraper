## Chapter 148 – Rest and Reorganization (4) – Lee Eunsol

*Ring, Ring, Ring*... *Thud!*  It was morning. I rubbed my sleepy eyes and got up to wash up.  As I cleansed my face and washed my hair, a few strands fell out. The scene of three strands of hair slowly spinning in a spiral, swaying in the atmospheric vortex and falling to the bathroom floor was imprinted on my mind like slow motion.  

When I applied lotion to my face at the sink, this time it was the pores embedded in my skin absorbing the lotion –  “Ah!  Just a little moderation. Do I have to see even this?”  There's no point in saying anything. It's not like someone is forcing me to see it. My upgraded eyes are simply showing me the true nature of the world I was unaware of. I looked in the mirror one last time.  The ordinary left eye that had served me my whole life.  The right eye, which was a stark contrast to it, looked at least 30% bigger. The pupil constantly twitched, and three dots embedded above, below left, and below right, like tiny lenses, were constantly changing focus, greedily absorbing information about the world.

While showering, the steam filling the bathroom condensed into a single drop of water, slowly coming into focus on the mirror. I watched the swaying of the falling water droplet before stepping out of the bathroom. It's been five days since we started our break.  It's been two days since I got these eyes from the merchant.  At first, I was so happy that we were given a seven-day break, but now I wish it was a few days longer.

As I stepped out of my room, I saw some of my colleagues already there.  "Eunsol, did you sleep well?"  "Good morning!" I greeted them casually and turned my head. I could feel Seungyeop flinching as he looked at my face.  I didn't feel particularly upset or anything.  Even I still get startled when I see my eyes in the mirror, so it's the same for my colleagues, isn't it? It takes time to adapt.  After all, my eye is 30% larger than a normal one.  A normal person's skull doesn't have room for an eye like this.  Therefore, the morning after I got my eye, I learned that a doctor (probably) at the hotel had performed a massive operation on my head.

As mealtime approached, the other colleagues gradually gathered near the dining table in Room 105.  Everyone flinched for a moment, but soon smiled brightly and greeted each other. I saw thread-like mm-sized scratches on Gain's cheek, who was smiling brightly.  Did she get scratched on something?  I could see every single pore on Song's face as she tugged at Pero's beak.  You washed with too hot water this morning, huh.  I could feel that Elena kept acting as if there was a transparent wall between her and Gain, anticipating the meal. It's been like that ever since we came out of the Gatekeeper's Room.  They must have had something fun together. I saw a scale fall from the mysterious right arm of Grandfather Muksung, who was yawning beside me.  And then there was Jincheol's peculiar behavior, which I had noticed yesterday.  ... I've seen too much.  My head was starting to ache.  My right eye has superhuman capabilities, but my brain is that of a normal human.  A human brain can't endlessly interpret this much visual information.

Eventually, I covered my eye with an eyepatch and leaned against the wall, thinking.  Not bad. It came at a great cost. I lost my real eye, my appearance is somewhat hideous, and I have chronic headaches. But, I have gained superhuman vision. An indescribable sense of accomplishment filled my heart. * – Lee Eunsol

After the meal, everyone went their separate ways, as they have been doing lately.  I stopped Jincheol, who seemed to be heading back to that damned safari.  "Jincheol."  "Huh?  Nu-nim?  Is there something you want to talk about?"  "Come with me for a moment.  I have something to ask you."  

A little while later, I prepared some light drinks at the cocktail bar.  Jincheol was sitting at the table across from me, and he started acting strangely again. His eyes were focused on something in mid-air.  His eyeballs were following something that only he could see.  He was sweating profusely as if he felt fear.  These are changes I hadn't noticed until recently.  

Jincheol isn't the type to whine about what's happening to him, so he just seemed to be hiding it. But, this naive attitude...  It's not a manly act to hide the changes that have happened to him in this place, but a foolish one.  "What are you looking at so intently?  Is there a ghost floating around?"  

"Ah... you noticed?"

"I noticed after I got my new eyes."

Jincheol took a deep breath and started drinking his cocktail.  I have a hunch about what it is.  The problem that arose in the Gatekeeper's Room, during the witch's disposal process.  Gain had warned us. She said that she had dealt with the witch using some of her own methods, but as long as Cha Jincheol was alive, the witch would never fully disappear. We had told Jincheol about this.  

After a moment of silence, Jincheol finally spoke.  "I first noticed it when we came out of the Gatekeeper's Room. There was something flying around, whether it was a ghost or a shadow, I didn't know.  Something was wrong with the hotel.  But, this strange being was only visible to me."

"It seems that way.  I can't see anything with my eyes now."

"Maybe it's the witch's soul?"

"I don't think so. According to the hotel's description, my eyes can see even invisible beings.  Even if it was a ghost, I'd be able to see it vaguely. But, the fact that my eyes can't detect anything at all means that it's not even a ghost, but simply an illusion that Jincheol, you, are seeing."

"It doesn't matter. The important thing is that the illusion is becoming clearer."

"Clearer?"

"Yes.  I noticed it two days ago, on the ski slope. I tried to snatch Gain as she was practicing teleportation, and I took a big leap into the air.  But as I was coming down, I saw something that looked like a human face.  Before that, it looked like a swaying shadow."

"What about now?"

"It's similar. It's slowly starting to look like a human figure. I can't recognize anyone yet."

"Is it the witch's remnant that's left behind as an illusion...?"

"Do you have any idea what to do?"

"I'm sorry.  I don't know much about this kind of supernatural stuff.  Why don't you ask the management team?"

"I already asked.  Grandpa isn't much help when it comes to this kind of thing. He said he doesn't know what to do either."

"..."

"I'll just wait and see. As it gradually becomes more defined, there might come a time when I can talk to it. When that time comes, I'll ask it what it wants."

It's not a real being, it's not a ghost, it's just a faint illusion that only Cha Jincheol can see, left behind in Cha Jincheol's brain.  I don't know what to do.  Like Jincheol said, I can't think of any other response than to wait. 

"If Gain comes by later, ask her for some advice."

"I don't have high hopes. From what I've felt so far, that advice feels like a mere pretense of helping once we're out of the Curse's Room."

"Didn't Gain say that the Owl doesn't want to help us?  She's only interested in Han Gain.  That's why if Gain asks for advice 'for us,' she can only give a lukewarm response."

"That's right."

"There's no way to help right now, but if anything unusual happens in the future, be sure to tell me. You might not have met her, but the witch...  I still remember vividly. She was a being filled with madness beyond imagination."

"Understood."

"Anyway, let's start calling the others.  Our vacation is almost over, and it's time to talk about 'that subject', isn't it?"

"I'll get them."

Jincheol got up from the bar and was about to turn around, but he asked one question.

"No need to call the kids?"

I responded with a slight smile. As expected, this guy isn't stupid.  He immediately understood why I chose the cocktail bar as the location.  * – Han Gain

Upon hearing that I was being called, I arrived at the cocktail bar.  Everyone except Seungyeop and Ari was there.  Maybe it's because it's awkward to jump right into a heavy conversation, Nu-nim made various kinds of cocktails and gave us each one.  

The cocktail in the glass that was handed to me was made with Kahlua, rum, and cola, apparently. ... I still don't know much about the taste of alcohol. I shared my honest opinion.

"Nu-nim."

"Yes?  Is it good?"

"Instead of making a makeshift cola cocktail by mixing various things into cola, wouldn't it be better to just drink cola? It tastes like a fake cola - "

*Thwack!*  I got slapped.  Nu-nim said she wouldn't make any more cocktails for me, then left. But honestly, I think plain cola is better than cola mixed with some messy alcohol.  

Anyway, seeing the members gathered, we immediately understood what the topic of today's conversation was.  It's a matter we have to address.  It's time to discuss 'revival'.

Nu-nim started the conversation, as if she thought the atmosphere was relaxed enough.  "As you can tell, I gathered everyone here to talk about who we should revive. I'm not going to decide today.  We can't revive someone with just the ticket, can we? We need to find the Revival Room.  We'll discuss it again after we find the place.  But, I gathered everyone to get everyone's thoughts in order."

Elena asked.  "The reason we're meeting without Ari is because Ari's answer is already decided, right?"

"That's right. To be more precise, I excluded people who wouldn't make this discussion rational.  Ari can't be rational because it's related to her mother, and Seungyeop is young, but he'd try to side with Ari."

I sighed as I listened.  Seungyeop...

"First, let's list the revival candidates we've gathered so far.  1. Miro, Ari's mother.  2. Kim Sanghyun, the doctor who treated Gain.  3. Estavio, the alien who helped Song.  4. Cha Seungjin, the special forces soldier who helped Seungyeop in the Gatekeeper's Room."

"We've met quite a few people so far, but there aren't that many people who qualify as revival candidates."

"Not yet. But we might meet more in the future, and there might have been other revival candidates among the people we've already met.  I've just chosen the obvious ones."

Jincheol-hyung spoke up.  "I'll share my opinion. I think it's strange to even assume that we should use this single ticket for someone else. If one of us dies permanently, we can still use it, right?"

"That's right."

"So, I don't want to use it for any of the candidates Nu-nim mentioned.  I'm sorry Ari, but the people I'm with at the hotel now are more important to me."

"That's fine.  Let's consider that as an important opinion, and save it for when one of us dies.  I understand.  " 

Nu-nim wrote Jincheol-hyung's opinion on the whiteboard and looked around at the others.  "What do you guys think?"

I started to gather my thoughts.  If I were to use the ticket for someone, who should I revive? What factors should I consider when choosing a revival candidate?
