## Chapter 193 – Party Time – Secret of the Second Floor (2)

**Date:** Day 94
**Current Location:** Hanbing Hell – Revival Room
**Sage's Advice:** 0

Despite Han Gain’s impressive first step, it didn’t take long for us to return to the first floor. The second floor of the hotel, where the ceiling was ripped open and a massive blizzard raged, was actually somewhat protected by the remaining walls. However, the blizzard outside, with no walls whatsoever, was different from the second floor. The severity of the cold was comparable, but the issue was the harsh wind.  It was impossible to take even a single step, I heard.  Of course, I, wearing my protective suit, couldn't really feel it. 

There was also a suggestion to take Pero out, but Pero was always in Song Yi’s room, and Song Yi, despite being called through the chat window, didn’t respond.  It seemed everyone except Jin Cheol had passed out due to the excessive exhaustion caused by the incense of peace.

But delaying exploration until tomorrow wasn’t a good idea, either. After the hotel repairs, there was no guarantee we could get out.  Who knows, they might even reinforce the outer walls to prevent us from breaking through after repairs?  It was clear that Owl’s urgency in giving us advice "today" had its reasons.

In the end, we tore down the hotel curtains again, just like before, to make a strong rope and tied all four of us together.  This completed exploration formation looked like this: In the front was me, wearing a protective suit and boasting a weight of 200 kg or more; behind me were Ari and Grandpa, both fully equipped with winter clothes; and lastly, at the rear, was Jin Cheol, the only one among us who could withstand the harshness of the cold without any protective gear.

We began exploration once more.

*Whiiiing!*  The wind blew, lifting my entire body slightly before bringing it down.  Considering my current weight exceeds 200 kg, this isn’t a normal wind at all.

One step. One step.  The accumulated snow caused my feet to sink to my knees every now and then, making it very difficult to walk.

Han Gain: Are you okay?
Kim Ari: *No energy to reply*
Cha Jin Cheol: Slowly. Even slower than a child’s pace now.

We started moving at a child’s crawling speed due to the constant urging to slow down.  The others were struggling even to stand, so there wasn’t much choice.

The more I looked around, the more I realized how bizarre this place was.  Firstly, nothing other than the "mountain" was visible. The blizzard blocked our view, but even with obstructed vision, at least some faint outlines should be visible.  The shape of the mountain we were walking on was clear as soon as we stepped outside the hotel's second floor.  But there was no other scenery, no other terrain.  It was as if…  there was no terrain at all except the mountain.  

I decided to keep this possibility in mind.  Since we realized that the outside of the second floor was different from the first floor, we shouldn't hold on to preconceived notions. This might not be Earth, it could be a special space like the hotel's basement. For instance, the hotel basement has a peculiar place called "Mountaineering Room," which literally only has a mountain for mountaineering, and no other terrain.

After about 30 minutes, we realized we had hit a snag.  We circled around the outside of the hotel’s second floor, and every direction was a cliff. It seemed the hotel was situated between extremely steep terrain.  In reality, building a hotel in a place like this would be absurd.  How would customers find the hotel if there’s no path? This kind of location is only suitable for a hotel that abducts customers at will.

Han Gain: Cliffs in every direction. It’s like a floating island.
Cha Jin Cheol: There is no way out of the mountain. This terrain is truly unusual. Could such terrain form naturally?

Finally, after gathering opinions, we came up with a solution.  I, with my weight exceeding 200 kg, would act as an anchor at the top of the steep terrain, and the rest of us would descend by holding onto a sheet. Jin Cheol, who was the only one who could break the ice on the wall, would create small niches where everyone could rest and regain strength. Finally, I just collided with the terrain and descended.

I’m not sure if I should say I descended or fell, but even with the protective suit, the impact on my entire body was significant, making it hard to move properly for a while.

Through this kind of exploration in extreme conditions, we finally found a gigantic tree, large enough to be out of sight, and gathered under it.

“It’s at least a little calmer here.”
“Yeah, the branches are so thick and sturdy, they seem to block some of the wind.”
“What have you all been thinking about?  Isn’t the landscape incredibly strange? Look over there.”

I pointed to the direction where a pure white world could be seen.  Literally pure white. Even in a blizzard, some dark shapes should be visible, but...  Ari nodded.

“It seems there’s nothing in this space except the mountain. There’s something even weirder.  Has anyone seen any living creatures while walking so far?”

Grandpa immediately reacted.

“I felt it too.  Even on a snowy mountain, at least a rabbit, a fox, should be normal, right?  How come there’s not even a single mouse on this gigantic mountain?  There’s not even any grass on the ground. The only living things are us.”

“Well, technically there is this tree.”  Jin Cheol’s surprised voice came through.  “What the heck is this tree? Come, everyone, come here!”

Hearing his words, we all approached the tree trunk and understood what he meant.

“This isn’t a real tree?”

It was a place where things weren't clearly visible, so it took us a while to notice. Surprisingly, the tree we relied on for shelter wasn’t real.  It looked like it was made of plastic, maybe mixed with metal, but one thing was certain, it wasn’t real.  It was a model.

It’s getting more and more incomprehensible.  Even this tree is not alive, and the only living things in this space are truly just us.

...I felt a little chill. The fact that there was no life whatsoever in this vast wilderness, which should be teeming with life, sent a chill through our hearts.

“Let’s go now that we’ve caught our breath.  By the way, it’s probably way past dinner time now.”

“Don’t worry.  I’ve left a note on the table saying we went out for exploration, so people coming out for dinner will understand. The real concern is something else.”

“How are we supposed to go back?”
“Exactly what I was thinking.  We’ve risked it all to come down to the bottom of the steep terrain near the hotel, but how are we going to climb back up?”

Ari replied as if wondering what the fuss was about.

“If there’s no other way, Gain can just descend and move us!”

Jin Cheol chuckled. 

“Honestly, I was thinking the same thing while coming down. You’ll move us, right?”

“...If there’s no other way, that’s what we’ll have to do.”

It was an obvious fact, but ‘descent’ was always our last resort.  No matter how difficult and unsolvable the problem, a descent would solve it. And in reality, I, having descended, was capable of solving almost every problem we faced at the hotel.  What kind of entity is this ‘Master’ who gave us this absurd power? 

Jin Cheol added in a reassuring tone.

“We didn’t come down relying solely on your descent, I have my own idea as well. It’s called the "make your own way" plan, you could say.”

“You mean, you’re going to use stars to dig a mole tunnel upwards on the cliff. Is that it?”

“Does that seem like it’ll work?”

Surprisingly, it sounded like it would work, and even I felt a bit reassured.

“Let’s go!”

Dismissing the thoughts of going back to room 104 for a moment, I stepped forward again, towards the white hell.

*

We walked, walked, and walked again on the pure white field. It felt like 4 or 5 hours had passed. But in this situation, it’s difficult to say for sure since time can pass unusually fast.  Anyway, the status window still showed that the date hasn’t changed yet.  Since we descended below the steep terrain near the hotel, there was no change in terrain whatsoever, just endless plains. We walked without exchanging a word.  And then something appeared.

*Thud!*

“What the heck is this?  Ah, you can hear me now?”

“Yes.  The wind is calmer here. This is... some kind of wall?”

I saw Grandpa tilting his head and punching the wall.

“Wall? It looks more like a crystal. Do you want to break it?”

“Let’s think about it a little more.”

Finally, we reached the end of the snowfield where the second floor of the hotel was located.  At the end stood a sheer, opaque barrier, so high that its height was impossible to see.

Then I realized the answer to some of the strange feelings I had been having all this time.  Why didn’t I see even the slightest dark shape, only a white expanse, no matter where I looked, even with the snow and wind? Because there was truly no terrain other than the mountain, and the entire space was blocked off by the opaque barrier. 

At this point, I was more curious than concerned about what kind of reward might await us at the end of this exploration.  Where in the world is this place?  How can a space so incomprehensible exist? I was baffled, wondering what this was all about, when Ari, who had been quiet for a long time, murmured.

“This place… I think I know where it is.”

Everyone’s eyes turned to her.  Jin Cheol asked, curious.

“Where?”

“... ”

“Tell us. Where is it?”

“How. How can there be a hotel in ‘this place’?  How? No, am I wrong? Everyone, turn around and look at the scenery, then look at this barrier again. Isn’t this a very familiar landscape? A scene you’ve all seen at least once in your life!”

Strange. Ari’s reaction was as if this bizarre landscape was a familiar place to us as well.  I turned around, looking at the surroundings, recalling the features I’d found so far.

First, there’s snow and wind everywhere.
Second, the only meaningful terrain or building is the mountain in the center and the hotel on the mountainside.
Third, there are no living creatures, not even a single mouse or a blade of grass.  There is only one giant tree model.
Fourth, if you walk from the mountain and across the flatlands, a sheer, opaque barrier appears that reaches towards the sky.

...Then I realized what this place was.

We are inside a giant snow globe.
