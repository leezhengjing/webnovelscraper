## Chapter 169 – Room 201, The Cursed Room – ‘The Cube’ (18) – Han Gain

*Clang!* A loud sound jolted me awake. Now, it was time for the protagonist to make his move! … What’s with the atmosphere? Before I could even grasp the situation, a piercing headache stabbed at my mind, and I hurriedly activated my status window! What in the world is going on? I couldn’t see anyone else, only Song-i was in front of me.

“Song-i? What the -” 

“Don’t raise your head. Even with your status window, it’ll be tough to endure. This is my last help.” 

With those words, a brilliant flash erupted from Song-i’s bracelet, brighter than any time before. A powerful protection, drawing on all of Song-i’s remaining vitality, enveloped me. I had already confirmed Song-i’s ‘Death Buff’. A part of the restriction placed on Song-i’s legacy, ‘Diverse Perspectives’, was embedded within the legacy itself. However, a far greater restriction came from Song-i’s own body, burdened by the use of the legacy. In other words, by giving up her life, Song-i could wield power far beyond her usual limits. 

Unbearably massive amounts of information bombarded me. The immeasurable knowledge about the world's secrets that the Chief Researcher had painstakingly gathered! I endured the splitting headache and thought. Why was ‘I’ the target of this room’s seal? Where is Beatrice’s main body? What method did the Chief Researcher use to control Beatrice? 

All these questions led to one conclusion. Beatrice’s main body is located in the place where the Zeroth Dimension's Eye is sealed. And, I am the only one who can access that location. Even Beatrice herself could never approach her main body, as she would be consumed by madness the moment her consciousness transferred. I was the only one who could withstand the pressure of the Zeroth Dimension's Eye and enter the sealed area, thanks to Song-i’s mental protection through her bracelet and my resistance through the status window. While something similar is possible for Ari with Song-i’s help, unlike the status window, Ari’s physical limitations exist due to the blood she consumes. 

More memories flooded in. As I started feeling dizzy, I finally understood the ‘real solution’ to this room.

“What in the world! Is this Chief Researcher actually human?”

‘Unfortunately, I’m definitely a Homo Sapiens.’

“… I never knew this kind of thing was possible. Did your personality get reassembled?”

‘It's one of my many skills. Be careful in other rooms too.’

“…”

From just a short conversation, I realized something. He knows that this place is a hotel. Is it a trait unique to the Chief Researcher, or is it common for all the characters awakened during the seal's release? I can’t say for sure.

‘Have you understood the reality now? Are you ready?’

My head is throbbing. I… definitely can’t do it like the Chief Researcher.

‘No need to worry. Don’t you know? You have complete control. Just do it your way and leave it to me only when you’re truly helpless.’

… Whatever the reason, I need to solve this room and get out. Let’s proceed. Even if the status window doesn’t have a time limit, Song-i’s mental protection does.

In the center of the broken, irregular polyhedron, which Jin-cheol had destroyed, something resembling a white vortex appeared. It was already heavily damaged, but I managed to slightly expand the ‘passage’ by messing with the remaining wreckage, the remnants of the facility. Then, Beatrice appeared. She smirked and glanced upwards. I saw a vast eye, already large enough to obscure the horizon, looking down at the world like the sun.

“Come closer.”

“You!”

“You’re not bad. To be able to handle this level of pressure and still hold a conversation. You’re not able to withstand this vortex, are you?”

‘Give me a chance.’

Do as you wish. The passage needs time to expand anyway. 

Moments later, my mouth began moving on its own.

“Beatrice. My dear daughter. Didn’t I tell you to only engage in things you can handle?”

“Father! You…. If you hadn’t… I could have gone outside long ago!”

“You’re causing all this chaos just for some fresh air?”

“…”

“No, no. Actually, it was Patrick who let you go. Patrick, that child, had his own resolve. You should be grateful to me. If it wasn’t for me, you would have spent endless nights in fear of the monsters you create yourself.”

“I’m still grateful for that. But father, you’ve taught me enough. Wouldn’t it be a noble father’s role to die properly and bequeath your legacy? If you had only left me with the irregular polyhedron, I would have torn you apart long ago!”

“Oh, please! The irregular polyhedron is not something you can give to anyone. And besides, who raised you to be such a degenerate brat?”

“Sorry. I killed my mother with my own hands when I was young.”

“That’s why you grew up to be such a degenerate. It’s my fault for not being a good father.”

As I listened to their incredibly close father-daughter banter, the passage finally expanded enough for me to pass.

“Unfortunately, father is leaving for a faraway place. Take care.”

Beatrice, completely losing her confident demeanor from earlier, trembled.

“Father… Please, just one more time -”

The vortex swallowed me.

* – Han Gain

The vortex’s interior was a truly bizarre space. Countless books opened and closed, floating haphazardly, while countless displays appeared and disappeared repeatedly.

‘Have you understood what the Zeroth Dimension’s Eye is?’

“I don’t know.”

‘It’s a higher-dimensional being that came down from above. It treats all things as creations, and it desires to endlessly carve cruel records. One cannot deny that it is a false creator.’

“It feels like touching an elephant blindfolded. Can you really understand such a magnificent being?”

‘Believe me. This information originated from a reliable source.’

“A reliable source?”

‘It injects a fraction of its confusing knowledge into mortals who come into contact with it. Through this, mortals believe they are insignificant specks and crumble in despair.’

…‘Of course, that's not all. It's common for a mortal's spirit to drift like a water lily when they come into contact with a Great One. This is what is called vibration.’

“Vibration?”

‘A human may simply walk, but the vibrations from each step overturn the world of tiny beings, and countless insects are crushed and die with every step.’

“After seeing your memories and hearing your words, one thought came to mind.”

‘Speak.’

“Your words are like saying a blind man touched an elephant and understood it all. How can you possibly understand such a strange being? A false creator?”

‘I want to talk about one belief, one piece of evidence.’

“One belief, one piece of evidence?”

‘If there is truly a creator in this universe, it would never desire only suffering in the world. Therefore, I believe that such a being, who carves cruel records, cannot be the true creator.’

“On the contrary, after learning how the ‘real you’ outside the hotel used this method to save the world, it seems like the creator is indeed a deranged being.”

‘It’s merely the result of my own shortcomings… Can you think of a better method?’

…‘Patrick betrayed me for the same reason, and yet he gave up again and entrusted me with everything when you all invaded. He didn’t agree with my method, but he couldn’t find another. In fact, Patrick was using the same method to maintain the seal during my absence.’

“Okay, belief is one thing, but what about the evidence?”

‘The evidence is very simple and clear. Aren’t we all trapped in the hotel right now?’

???

‘Why would an all-powerful creator who came down from a higher dimension be trapped in a hotel room? It’s because he wasn’t that kind of being in the first place.’

I was convinced by his words. 

… This is dangerous. Regardless of the settings of Room 201, I’m starting to understand the ‘sealing’ system more and more. As the seal breaks, the main characters of the scenario awaken within me. That’s fine, it can even be considered a benefit of breaking the seal, as it gives you powerful advisors. The control is completely in the hands of the hotel participants. The problem is when you’re persuaded by the scenario characters' way of thinking, like now! Just now, I was convinced by the logic the Chief Researcher laid out. At the same time, I realized that I and he are somewhat intertwined. 

The second floor and the first floor are truly different. There’s something… it feels like the purpose of the room itself is different.

* ‘Long time no see! You’ve been in the tank for too long, haven’t you? It was fun without you.’

* As I pushed through the endless sea of books and displays, a piercing voice echoed. Time is running out. The status window might not have a time limit, but Song-i’s protection does.

“It’s alright. We’re almost to the place where Beatrice’s main body is. Now, it’s time for that child to fulfill its destiny.”

…“By the way… since you understand the situation to a certain extent, don’t you find the term ‘seal’ quite ironic? Humans sealing such a being! It would be easier to put the sun in your house’s refrigerator.”

…“All I did was provide the cruel ‘theater’ that being desired. There was some sacrifice, but humanity gained peace. If it wasn’t for me, the Zeroth Dimension’s Eye would have used the entire star as its theater.”

‘Is that what you call a theater, feeding humans to a devil’s mouth?’

“It was a tiring task. For a long time, we had to bring people to the cube we created inside the irregular polyhedron and kill them. It was quite a difficult task to do everything manually. There was a more serious problem.”

‘…’

“All stimulation becomes boring eventually. Even a cruel god eventually feels bored. Something… another ‘actor’ was needed. Something that guarantees unending entertainment.”

‘Was it Beatrice?’

“Yes, yes. She’s right there. Isn’t she truly a gift to humanity?”

Who am I? At what point does my voice become mine and when does it become the Chief Researcher’s? As I’m convinced by his words, I feel the distinction between us becoming meaningless.

Finally, Beatrice’s main body appeared.

… Before me stood a cloudy test tube… and a human brain floating inside it.

“Don’t think of it as cruel. It doesn’t have sensory organs, and its consciousness is elsewhere, so it can survive even here. This child has quite the resilience, but it can’t compare to us.”

A multi-faceted object, glowing ominously, emerged from the Chief Researcher’s hand.

“Do you think destroying this floating brain is the solution? It might be. But in the end, the hotel always wanted to solve the ‘source of the curse’. You need to kill the opponent, you need to deal with the prisoner. Aren’t all these things just hypotheses you created based on your assumptions?”

‘What do you mean?’

“I’m saying, what’s the point of destroying Beatrice’s brain? The Zeroth Dimension’s Eye will be swallowing the world in real time. In the end, you have to make a decision. Of course… I told you before, right? I have no intention of forcing you. I can’t even if I wanted to. You always have the control.”

The Chief Researcher asked me if I had a better way to save the world. I couldn’t think of the answer.

“You’re very conflicted. What’s causing you so much trouble? After all, Room 201 is all just a fake world created by the hotel. What’s the big deal about feeding NPCs to the devil? It's not so different from what you’ve done countless times for the sake of necessity, isn’t it?”

Why is it? As the Chief Researcher said, we’ve already been killing people inside the room as needed. But why is my mind in such turmoil now?

… I know the answer. Only after the Chief Researcher’s memories awakened within me did I accept it. Only today, I truly realized that what happened in Room 201 also happened in reality. I realized that humanity, and ‘I’ before, had lived based on such sacrifices…

I don’t know. Honestly, I don’t know what the better way is. What was I outside? I was just a student studying for the college entrance exam. Now, the problem given to me in Room 201 is like a test where the passing grade is 30 out of 100. It’s not hard to pass. Just score over 30 and you can leave the room and take the legacy. However…

‘The examiner’ seems to want something far more advanced. Maybe even an answer the examiner himself doesn’t know. 

When I gave up finding a better answer, I could no longer move my body. An ominous glow emanated from the multi-faceted object in my hand. A song of evil offerings echoed from my lips.

“I offer it! I offer it! To the Great Eye, I offer the theater where I sing of suffering for an eternity. Here is an immortal goat for you. Here is the eternally regenerating Sehrimnir!”

I feel that giant gaze on me again. Somewhere far away, in a realm inaccessible by foot, ‘The Cube’ has appeared once again. Beatrice’s brain was moved to the center of the cube. Beatrice, screaming in fear and pain, once again began filling the cube with monsters. Now, this theater will never close. Beatrice will eternally create monsters like the pig in Norse mythology who endlessly regenerated and became a source of food, and the Bureau will endlessly pour humans into it. So that the cruel god will never turn his gaze back to Earth.

I hear cries. The screams of the sacrificial offerings, whose sacrifice prevented the suffering of the star, pierced my ears like needles. I hear the cruel god’s laughter from all directions. And, the ‘finger’ came down.
