## Chapter 191 – A Prayer for the Maze (10) Fin

**Date:** Day 94
**Current Location:** Hanbing Hell – Room of Resurrection
**Sage's Advice:** 3

When Han Gained regained consciousness, she found herself standing in the midst of the frigid snowfield, a scene she was still unable to get used to despite experiencing it several times. Although the former participant's hell differed from the Room of Curse, it was similar in that it collapsed after completion, releasing its occupants back outside. The first thing they found upon emerging was Jincheol, kneeling in the field. 

“Hyung! Did you wait – No, why are you in such a state?” It was the first time she’d seen Jincheol looking so ‘thin’ since entering the hotel!  She knew the people praying outside weren’t having an easy time, but Hyung looked as if he’d lost more than 10 kg in weight. It was hard to even imagine what he’d gone through. 

“Finally! You’re finally out! If you had been even a little later, I would have collapsed too.”

“What happened here? Where did everyone else go?”

“They’re all resting in Room 105.”

“What? Room 105? Didn’t the first floor become unusable when we left for Hanbing Hell?”

Jincheol chuckled bitterly, and the Grandfather opened his mouth.

“He used the Reward, Resting Ticket from Room 106.”

“It couldn’t be helped. Everyone was extremely exhausted and exposed to the severe cold for too long. I was afraid they would all freeze to death.”

“Well done. Aren’t they consumables anyway? It was created to be used in times of crisis, and they used it.”

Following Jincheol’s explanation, everyone understood the situation.

“I didn’t know the Scented Herb of Rest was so dangerous.”

“This damned hotel, how can even a herb be deadly?”

“Did you carry everyone to Room 105 after using the Resting Ticket?”

Jincheol smiled lightly.

“I carried Seungyeop, Songi, and Elena. 누님 probably went on her own. And... honestly, I'm struggling too.”

As soon as he finished, the Grandfather replied,

“I’ve been wondering what was going on, seeing your body since earlier.  Why don’t you go to Room 105 too? We’ve finished most of our business here. Guide! Do we have anything else to do?”

The Guide, who had been floating in the air since earlier, immediately answered.

“No. You only need to listen to the instructions.”

“Go and rest for a bit. We can hear the instructions and relay them to you.”

“Then I’ll take my leave. And, Gain?”

“Yes?”

“What’s that on your waist? It wasn’t there when you entered.  I just wanted to tell you in case you didn’t notice.”

With those words, Jincheol turned and left.

“Waist? No, what is this?” Ari chuckled.

“Merry Christmas~! Looks like the Serial Killer Santa really liked Gain.  He even gave her a gift at the last moment!”

The Grandfather sighed.

“Just throw it away. That crazy monster.”

The object attached to her waist was a stuffed doll that looked remarkably like ‘her’. Honestly, it made her feel uneasy, but she couldn’t tell whether it was because the doll itself was creepy or because the person who gave it to her was creepy. 

After Jincheol disappeared, only those who had been through the Maze’s hell remained in Hanbing Hell, where the bitter cold and the wind like blades continued to rage.

“I’m sure the scenario said something about ‘the resentment of the dead trapped in hell being the source of the cold.’ ”

“That’s correct.”

“Why is it still so cold?  Shouldn’t the cold have dissipated?”

“Good question. I will explain that right now. Participants! You have worked hard. You have succeeded in stopping the suffering of one of the dead trapped in hell!”

Once this confirmation was received, everyone turned their attention to the statue that had imprisoned the Maze.  The Maze was still asleep within the ice, but he no longer moaned in pain like the other statues of the dead. He simply had a peaceful expression, as if he were dreaming a good dream.

Ari didn’t react much, but her expression alone revealed her immense relief.  Suddenly, she felt happy that she had achieved a decent outcome.

“Thanks to your good deeds, the dead have gained hope and the cold of hell can no longer threaten the hotel. The first floor has already escaped the extreme cold. The second floor will be repaired tomorrow.”

“You only mentioned the first and second floors. Does that mean Hanbing Hell, or is it the Room of Resurrection?  Anyway, this place is still cold, right?”

“The first and second floors became cold because the cold of hell had destroyed the hotel, not because they were inherently cold places. Hanbing Hell is different. It’s a place that’s naturally cold, regardless of the hotel’s repairs.”

The Room of Resurrection would remain cold, but it wasn’t a major problem. After all, it wasn’t a place they would enter routinely.

Finally, the hotel’s ice age, which had been causing headaches for a long time, was over!  Feeling proud, they exchanged smiles.

“I explained about prayer and resurrection a few days ago. Let me reiterate: prayer and resurrection are separate. Prayer is just a procedure to end the suffering of former participants and restore warmth to the hotel. If you wish for resurrection, you must use a Ticket. Will you use it?”

Silence descended.  Han Gain and the Grandfather looked at Ari awkwardly, and she chuckled.

“What are you looking at? Resurrection through the Ticket is something we need to agree on.  We had talked about trying to revive the doctor, remember?”

“We also said we would discuss it again after finding the Room of Resurrection. I didn’t think we would find it so quickly.”

“Anyway, I don’t intend to use it now. We haven’t found a way to restore the Maze to his senses, have we?  We’ve got a pretty good idea where we might find a way, but we still need to go there.”

Thank goodness. The Ticket was too precious for the three of them to decide on their own, and they couldn’t make a decision about the ‘new teammate’ by themselves. It was definitely something they needed to discuss with everyone resting in Room 105.

Speaking of which, how to restore the Maze’s mind… Considering the earlier meaningful conversation, the answer to the problem related to the Maze might lie in the ‘Room of Mirrors’, right? Of course, they would have to go there to know for sure.

The Guide continued speaking.

“For your information, the Room of Resurrection is also one of the ‘secret rooms’ within the hotel. In other words, it’s not a room you can enter anytime.  You can only enter again when Party Time arrives.”

Ari replied casually,

“Well, we already used the 3-day Resting Ticket. I think it includes today, so we’ll have Party Time for the next two days.”

“If you plan to use the Ticket, let’s discuss it with the others and enter again tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.”

In the end, the 3-day Resting Ticket seemed to have been used appropriately. They had gained time for rest and a meeting to finalize their decision on who to resurrect. 

With that, the Hanbing Hell business was finished.

* * *

Feeling relieved that everything was over and having used the Resting Ticket, they decided to relax and started leaving Hanbing Hell. Then, an anomaly occurred.

“What? Wait, everyone stop!”

“What is it? Gain, is something wrong?”

“T-the Advice just activated.”

“What did you ask?”

“I didn’t ask anything!  Just like in the Room of Gates, the remaining uses disappeared suddenly and only the answer appeared!”

The Grandfather sighed deeply.

“Looks like something else has happened.  Well, what does it say?”

“‘Why are the repair times of the first and second floors different?’ ”

“What does tha -”

— Woo-woo-wooong! 

As Han Gain explained the content of the Advice to her companions, a strange sound came from the drone watching them from the opposite side.  The propellers that were keeping the drone aloft vibrated rapidly, and its body shook.  Then, a voice with a different tone from the one they had heard before came through.

“Haha! ‘Wisdom’. That’s a bit much. The participants were completely clueless, and yet you directly told them. Isn’t that crossing the line?”

If they still hadn’t noticed what was happening, it meant their time spent in the hotel so far was all in vain. It was time to start ‘thinking fast’. There was a ‘hint’ somewhere in the information they had just received from the drone, and the Owl had decided to give them advice, albeit a bit forcefully, because they were about to leave without noticing it!

Immediately, the three stopped and began thinking about the content of the advice, the topic of ‘repair times of the first and second floors’.  Ari muttered as if she had realized something.

“Now that I think about it, it is peculiar. Why would the two floors have different repair times?”

The Grandfather replied.

“I didn’t find it strange. After all, the source of the cold is Hanbing Hell, and isn’t Hanbing Hell on the second floor?  It’s closer to the source of the cold, so it makes sense that the repairs would take longer...”

Hearing that, Han Gain realized the dissonance.

“Isn’t this place different from a real building where ‘common sense’ applies? This isn’t a place where workers come and repair things with hammers.  It’s not strange if an invisible fairy-like being fixes it in a second with a flick of its finger, right?”

“Why would the repair times need to be different?”

“That’s right.  Thinking about it, we’ve destroyed the hotel many times, but there’s never been a situation where one part was repaired and another remained broken.”

Hotel Pioneer.  In this bizarre place, once a ‘special event’ was over, any damaged facilities should be repaired immediately. Why was the first floor repaired immediately, but the second floor left unrepaired?  Why would they bother doing that?

They couldn’t easily find an answer to this question, and everyone stood still when the drone intervened.

“Looks like it will take quite a while for you to figure it out on your own.”

“...I’ve been feeling it for a while now, but your tone is different from before.”

If the Guide had simply been an AI drone until now, it felt like it was now relaying the voice of ‘someone’ directly.

“Let’s just say it’s the administrator of this place. In fact, I was considering erasing your memories about the Owl’s advice a while ago.”

“... ”

“However... Yes. While it was a bit of a line-crossing for the Owl to intervene when you were completely unaware, it also means that the Owl felt you were worth investing in.  Proving your potential to your patron and gaining favor is also part of your ability, wouldn’t you say?”

The Owl likes me? That’s an incredible story!  ...  Somehow, the time she had spent blaming the Owl came to mind.  She began to wonder if she should suddenly kneel and apologize.

“Stop pondering here and go to the second floor.  Look around and think about what the meaning of the second floor being repaired late could be.”
