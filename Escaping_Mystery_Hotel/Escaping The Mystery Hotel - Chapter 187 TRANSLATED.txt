## Chapter 186 – Prayer for the Labyrinth (5)

**Date:** 92nd Day

**Current Location:** Labyrinth of Hell

**Sage’s Advice:** 2]

– Han Gain 
“Labyrinth, Labyrinth. Come over here! Quickly!” 
“Huh? Why suddenly? What -”

— Rustle! Clank!

As the bushes rustled and ‘something’ jumped out, the extreme tension instantly dissipated. What had jumped out from the bushes was neither a monster nor a demon. It was just a rather handsome reindeer.

“Ah.” 

“Ehehe! Gain is afraid of deer too? There are so many of these kids around school!”

Labyrinth walked confidently towards the reindeer, startling Han Gain. Although it wasn’t a monster as initially expected, a reindeer is still a dangerous creature for a middle school girl.

“Labyrinth be careful! That’s not a small deer, it’s a reindeer! It’s dangerous.”

“Haha, child. Don’t worry.” 

Surprised by the gentle voice suddenly coming from behind, Han Gain turned around. Behind her was a grandfather with a burly physique and a very familiar outfit. 

“Who are you?”

“Oh my! You haven’t even heard of Santa Claus?”

“I know who he is, but you just suddenly appeared.”

“Suddenly? Child! Can’t you hear that music?” 

We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy New Year!

The cheerful carol had been playing non-stop since they arrived at this place.

“I can hear it.” 

“So the word ‘suddenly’ is not accurate. You know tomorrow is Christmas, right?”

“I didn’t realize. I haven’t been paying attention to the date.”

“Oh dear. Disappointing! However, seeing how you’re worried about that child, you seem to be a good kid. I’ll forgive you.”

“…Yes.”

While Han Gain was having a conversation with the self-proclaimed ‘Santa Claus’, Labyrinth was happily playing with the reindeer.

“Wow! What a beautiful scene. A beautiful sight. Such a child like a snow fairy. Little one, do you perhaps like that child?”

“I really don’t.”

“You’re not being honest! You made me want to scold you just now. But today is Christmas Eve, so I’ll let it slide.”

What nonsense? He doesn't really like her! Listening to the ridiculous words about making assumptions and forgiving him made Han Gain dumbfounded.

“Your eyes can’t seem to leave that child. Are you still scared of the reindeer? Don’t worry. That child is called Comet, and while not as sturdy as Donner, he is still a kind child.”

“…That’s good. It’s getting late, but can we go eat dinner?”

“Oh! I like that statement. That’s right. Children should eat on time. Take your girlfriend with you.”

Han Gain felt no need to refute the old man's whimsical assumptions. Ignoring the old man, she took Labyrinth to the school cafeteria.

Han Gain: ‘Santa’ appears. Suspicious. Summoned by the school?

Kim Mookseong: Wait. … Kim Mookseong: He called? He called? Then is that old man just someone called by the school?

Out of curiosity, he looked out the window, but the Santa who had made him nervous earlier had already vanished. He also checked the scenario, but there was no change. It was exactly as the message said, ‘Wait for the night.’ Was Santa really just someone called by the school?

During dinner, Ari appeared and immediately asked:

“You said earlier that you found some traces of a ritual with the old man?”

“I didn’t find much, but I’ll tell you. The ritual itself was carried out a very long time ago. It has Christian traces and is a kind of magic at least 50 years old.”

“A magic ritual over 50 years old is causing problems now?”

“It might sound strange to someone who doesn’t know, but this kind of thing is common. Think about it logically. There’s no Wikipedia for evil magicians, nor is there a school for them, right?”

“I understand what you mean. There are no groups dedicated to preserving and transmitting knowledge, and organizations like the Management Bureau actually hinder the transmission of that knowledge.”

“Right. The more evil the knowledge, the harder it is to be passed down in its complete form. Even if you happen to obtain such knowledge, it’s usually incomplete. That’s why there are far more strange rituals in this world than you think, but only a very small percentage of them succeed as intended. The rest fail, leaving only traces behind.”

“Those traces are sometimes failed rituals that suddenly come to fruition decades later when certain conditions happen ‘by chance’.”

“Yes, roughly that’s the feeling. Is the scenario changing?”

“No. It still just says wait for tonight.” 

Ari looked out the window and muttered.

“Let’s go on patrol together.”

Until dinner, they walked around the outside of the building, and Han Gain also took a look at the ritual that the old man and Ari had discovered. She found no information. The ritual just looked like a pile of unidentified garbage to her, and there was no one outside the building.  The boarding school was located in a very rural area even within Indiana, USA, not a place where outsiders could easily enter.

“It's frustrating. And what’s with Santa? Isn’t this a high school? Santa events are only for elementary schools!”

“If you think like the 21st century you lived in, you’ll get into trouble. There are no smartphones during this period.”

“What does that have to do with anything?”

“This American rural school is filled with kids who will go crazy from boredom. So the school periodically holds events. The kids all know Santa is just someone the school pays. They even took requests for gifts a few days ago. Of course, I have no idea how we were dealt with.”

The night approached without any particular success.

– Labyrinth

Ha-aa-a-m! She yawned widely and looked around. Everyone was tired but awake. When will Santa come?

Gain, who was next to her, seemed more nervous than sleepy. 

“Gain, what did you write you want for a gift?”

“I don’t know.”

What a stupid answer. 

“Why are everyone waiting for Santa in the first place?”

“Gain, don’t you know that? They say he used to come into the dorm and put presents in socks next to beds. But many parents of the girls didn’t like Santa entering the dorms. So they all gather on the first floor to receive them.”

“…That’s a very realistic reason.”

“When will Santa come?” 

Gain thought for a moment and then answered. 

“The chat window, no, the old man said he’ll arrive around 2 am. If you’re sleepy, just go to sleep early.”

What nonsense is this?

“2 am? It’s midnight now.”

“Huh?”

“He’s here now. He’s outside.”

As soon as she finished her words, Gain’s face turned pale. Why is she doing this again? She was panicking alone when she saw the deer earlier. She’s more scared than she looks.

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

The cheerful carol resounded. Wouldn’t this be the most fun time of the year during the boring winter? 

— Bang!

Santa entered. The children all rejoiced.

“Woo-hoo! Santa Claus!”

“Did you bring my gift?”

“Grandpa~! Did you bring a skateboard~?”

“Oh! Cute babies. Of course, I brought presents. But…”

“Yes?”

“Are you a good kid?”

The boy in front, Thomas, answered with a bored expression. 

“Of course I’m super good. So just give me my skateboard. I -”

“You lied to me…”

“Huh?”

“You bad boy!”

— Crack!

Thomas’s head burst like a soft tomato dropped on the floor.

Christmas has begun.

*

“Aaaah!”

“Kyaaah!” 

Han Gain’s ears felt like they were going to fall off. All the children ran and ran, screaming wildly.

Dashing through the snow~! (Through the snow we dash!

As the cheerful carol played, snow suddenly began to fall from the sky, making everything slippery. Even though they were indoors! The children were slipping on the sudden snow, and a horrible sound came from behind every time they slipped.

Run, run, run, and run again. She didn’t want to think about what was happening behind her. Scared. Scared. Scared. Scared. Scared. Scared. Scared. Scared. Scared. Scared. Scared. Scared. Scared. Scared. Scared. Scared. 

Her heart was going to explode! What is happening? What is happening? 

The teachers appeared. At the front was the PE teacher who came a few days ago, Mookseong grandpa. Grandpa took off his gloves, and strange arms like monster’s arms appeared. Grandpa’s punch sent Santa Claus flying backward.

Seeing this, the teachers cheered and started firing their guns. Is it over now? She’s so sick of these strange events. 

Santa got up as if nothing had happened. 

A sleighing song tonight! (Tonight, we sing a sleighing song!)

Suddenly, the teachers froze like stone and dropped their guns, starting to sing. 

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way! (Jingle bells, jingle bells, all the way we jingle!)

As the teachers sang, their heads swayed side to side, and suddenly countless tomatoes appeared. The entire floor was covered in thick tomato soup. If you mix mushrooms and sprinkle pepper, it would be the perfect soup for breakfast! It’s a shame there are no eggs. 

Now she understands. She must have fallen asleep while waiting for Santa Claus. Could the abundance of tomatoes be because she’s hungry? If it’s morning now -

“Labyrinth, don’t think, just run.”

“Huh?”

Gain took her hand and started running. 

“Gain? You can’t run like this in school! The teacher always -”

“Just don’t think.”

In a one-horse open sleigh! (On a one-horse open sleigh!) 

Another verse of the carol was heard. The reindeer carriage she had seen earlier broke through the first-floor wall and entered! Comet, the gentle reindeer, had a red face and was eating the tomatoes all around. Comet, who was eating the tomatoes on the floor, slowly approached Han Gain. Would she become a tomato now? 

— Bang! Boom!

Suddenly, Gain vanished beside her, reappeared where Comet was, and the man-eating reindeer flew away! 

“G, g, g, Gain, what is this???” 

Gain chuckled and mumbled. 

“That Santa is a real piece of work. Now he’s summoning a monster carriage? He can do anything!”

With those words, Gain grabbed her hand again. While being dragged, Han Gain thought. Now she vaguely understands. This girl is completely different from ‘ordinary people’ like her. 

As they ran frantically towards the back door on the first floor, a car drove into the school, ‘smashing through the back door’! 

Before Han Gain could even open her mouth in shock, the girl inside the car window called out to Gain. 

“I’ll stop even if I have to crash! Take this! The number is written on the key.”

“Huh? Huh? I don’t have my license yet -”

— Vroom!

Who is this girl? A scary sound came from behind.

“Are you a good kid?”

“Shut up, you idiot!”

— Vroom! Bang!

She felt like she was going crazy. She just ran and ran, blindly pulled by the force that was pulling her. Gain, who dragged her into the red Cadillac driver’s seat, took a deep sigh. 

“Ah… I really have to learn how to drive a manual transmission later.”

“…”

“It’s not the right time to say this, but are you okay?”

“I have no idea what’s going on… It feels like I’ve suddenly entered a James Bond movie.” 

“I’m sorry.”

“What are you talking about?”

“This time, it seems like it’s going to be tough. It seems like I have to do something before that guy appears…”

“Since earlier, what are you -”

In a one-horse open sleigh! (On a one-horse open sleigh!) 

“He’s already here. He’s fast.”

“…”

Gain, who was about to leave, suddenly turned around. 

“Do you think you’re a good kid?”

“…I’ve never done anything bad.”

“Really? I don’t think you’re a very good kid.”

“Are you picking a fight right now?”

“However, you’re not the kind of evil person who would be killed endlessly by those monsters. Let’s try this one more time. We can do more while the incense is burning.”

“I have no idea what you’ve been saying since earlier!”

Right before leaving, the boy smiled at Han Gain. 

“See you later! Everything will be fine. May magic be imbued in these words!”

…Her consciousness fades.

When she realizes that the nightmare is going back to the beginning again, she forgets everything again. 

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
Oh! what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh.
