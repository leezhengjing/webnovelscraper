## Chapter 178 – Party Time – Floor 2 Exploration (5) – Cha Jincheol

*Whiiiing!* *Thud!* “Ugh, what the hell is this?!” A finger-sized ice shard flew through the blizzard, striking my face. Is this really Earth? It’s impossible to even take a single step with a human body.

Eeunsol: What?

Cha Jincheol: Talking to myself.

Kim Muksung: Please hurry up, I’m going to die.

…If it were normal, I’d tell him that he’s exaggerating again! But not now. The old man isn’t wearing a protective suit like the sister, nor does he have the blessing that makes me physically stronger. We could actually freeze to death if we stay in this place for too long. At least the grotesque, despite his grumpy attitude, was able to walk around okay.

The state of the second floor was even worse. If the state when we visited room 201 every day was like the Northern Hemisphere’s winter, then now it’s not even the level of the Antarctic or the Arctic. Considering I, who am benefiting from 용기 (Yonggi)‘s assistance, am feeling this cold, wouldn’t it mean the actual temperature has gone beyond even the coldest winters on Earth?

Purely because of the wind pressure, it was difficult to take even a single step. The sister, whose combined weight with her protective suit was heavier than mine, was walking much more easily. It felt like I was blind. The blizzard was so bad that anything over 5 meters away was just white, there was no way to distinguish any terrain or structures. Among this white hell, the only one who could see and move properly was the sister.

Eeunsol: This way.

Following the signal, I moved in front of the sister, and I saw a massive ice chunk blocking our path. “Hwaaaab! Achha!” The grotesque pecked at the ice with its beak, and I cleared the broken pieces. It seemed like we were making progress as we quickly cleared a path, but then snow started piling up again. Obviously, we’ll have to clear it again next time.

Cha Jincheol: Do you see anything?

Eeunsol: Nothing special. It seems like another dead end.

At least we were glad that someone was able to see and explore.

Kim Muksung: I’m going to die.

Cha Jincheol: Please wait a little longer.

Eeunsol: Grandfather, we’ll just go to one more place. Just one.

Just one place? Did the sister find somewhere she had her eye on amidst all this chaos? As expected, the sister beckoned me with a gesture, then moved quickly in a straight line without turning once.

Eeunsol: Here.

After pushing through the snow for a few steps, we saw a space that definitely deserved to be called a ‘room’. Unfortunately, due to the incomplete construction situation on the second floor, instead of proper doors or walls, there were just ice chunks, but it was undeniably a room-like structure.

Cha Jincheol: When it’s finished, will it be the Room of Curses?

Eeunsol: I don’t know.

I tried my hardest, but moving it as a whole was impossible. We had to break it up and move it piece by piece. “Pero, you little bastard, come here and peck at it with your beak.” … “Come here! I know you can hear me!” Unlike the sister, this bird, who obviously had extraordinary hearing, would try to slack off whenever Song Yi wasn’t around. It was admirable how it still followed us with a grumbling attitude, though? The grotesque approached, not hiding its dissatisfied expression—now I understand how this bird looks.

*Bang!* *Bang!* The grotesque continued to break the ice with its sharp beak, and I continued to move the broken pieces. As we opened the way, something opaque was visible on the floor inside the room.

“What is this?”

Eeunsol: I can’t hear you.

Cha Jincheol: What is that on the floor?

The sister tilted her head at my words, entered the room, and approached the opaque floor— “Euhhuuu! No way, why is that there?!” She rushed forward in panic, grabbed the sister by her protective suit, and pulled her back! “Ugh! Is that an ice pit?”

“Yes. Be careful. The sister is super heavy with her protective suit, it would be hard to pull her out if she falls in.”

“Why is there a pit all of a sudden? Is it a trap?”

“Watch your feet— huh? I can hear you clearly now?”  We hadn’t spoken a single word to each other in our own voices yet, what kind of magic is this?

“The sound of the blizzard stopped.”

“…Is this another strange space, then?”

Something inexplicable happened. It was obvious that the blizzard was still raging outside, threatening to tear the world apart, but we couldn’t hear it much inside the room. We had finally found a ‘quiet space’ since arriving on the second floor.

“What is it?”

“I don’t know… I don’t know the reason, but next time, let’s move the grandfather to this place for exploration. It seems the cold is much milder here.”

“Let’s do that. Anyway, what is that?”

At first, I thought it was another ice chunk. Then, realizing the temperature inside this room wasn’t enough to create such large ice, I thought it was something else, and upon closer inspection, I realized it was a different object. It was a huge door.

“… ”

“…It looks like it’s inviting us in?”

“Isn’t it a bit ominous?”

“Even so, if it’s a door, we have to open it….”

The moment I reached out and grabbed the doorknob, a notification popped up. /Would you like to open the door of the Hanbingjihok (Frozen Hell)? Opening the door will immediately end the Party Time./ I immediately let go of the doorknob. I turned my head, and saw the sister looking up with wide eyes, her expression slightly excited. It seems the notification was sent to both of us.

We had searched the frozen second floor for half a day, and finally found something.

— Cha Jincheol

As soon as I returned to the first floor, my companions greeted me. “Welcome back!” “Hyung, you worked hard!” “Okay, okay, everyone, step aside for a bit.” I immediately took the grandfather to the tea table. Thankfully, this time, warm drinks were waiting for us, without any pranks. While the grandfather was thawing his lips, which had turned blue, by drinking hot tea, the sister and I started discussing what we had found.

“Oppa, did you find something?”

“Yeah. I found something. Going from the entrance, roughly to the right, and then straight forward?”

“It’s closer to a diagonal than a straight line. I know the location.”

“Anyway, if you go straight in that direction, you’ll find a strange ‘Hanbingjihok (Frozen Hell) Door’. When I grabbed the doorknob, a notification said the Party Time would end as soon as the door opened. Naturally, I let go and came down.”

“The name ‘Hanbingjihok’ is very scary.”

“What do you think is behind the door?”

Everyone fell silent. The name of the door itself was blatantly the ‘Door of Hell’, wasn’t it? It’s hard to even imagine how horrific the things waiting behind it might be. 

The grandfather, whose body had thawed somewhat, opened his mouth. “It’s obvious. We have something to do beyond that door. But there’s no need to end the Party Time prematurely. We have to prepare somehow. Starting tomorrow, Gained will also be writing advice.  But ‘hell’…”

“Is there any word that comes to mind?”

“It’s a story we all know. Gained already heard it from the ‘Star Cloud Dragon’ and the Administration also knows. “

“Just tell us the gist.”

“Hey, you little punk, so rude. You know, ‘Buddha’… You all heard of it, right?”

…The word we had long forgotten struck everyone’s minds. The entity of unknown identity, ‘Buddha’. Even the ‘Star Cloud Dragon’, who was a prisoner in Room 102, had treated this incomprehensible transcendent being with extreme reverence and caution.

“If it’s Buddha, it’s Buddhism, and Buddhism is famous for hell, isn’t it?”

“Famous for hell… That’s a bit rough.”

“Eeunsol, just understand it vaguely. Anyway, in this hotel where Buddha exists, hell doesn’t sound ordinary. It doesn’t seem like they would have used the word hell just because it was dangerous and difficult.”

“Then why do you think they used it?”

“Well, I don’t know. Maybe it’s a place where even sinners are judged?”

Silence descended once again.

“Cough! Cough!”

“Ah, grandfather, maybe you should rest in your room for now.”

“It’s fine. It’s not a big deal— “

“Old man! Just stop being stubborn and lie down. We should rest too.”

The first day of Party Time ended like this.

The next morning, Elena woke up.

*

**Date: Day 90**

**Current Location: Floor 1, Room 105 – Room of Rest**

**Sage’s Advice: 3] **

— Han Gain

On the second morning of Party Time, when I arrived in Room 105 for breakfast, I immediately spotted Elena. Sitting alone at one end of the table, she rushed towards me the moment she saw me.

— *Tada-dak!*

The golden waves rippling like water, her eyes filled with the vitality of the green meadows, fixed on me. It was as if I had turned to stone, unable to move.

“…Elena?”

“… ”

“Do you have something you want to say?”

Elena stared at me intently and mumbled. “Is it right? No, it’s not? I don’t usually know this…”

“Yes?”

“I’m sorry. I was just checking something I heard from the sponsor.”

“What did you hear?”

Elena chuckled and replied. “Ah, regarding the use of my new ability, ‘Unfortunate Imagination’, I was told to have a discussion with you, Gain.”

“Ah! I was also thinking that we need to have a conversation. As expected, the sponsor knows everything.”

I recounted the knowledge about the use of ‘Unfortunate Imagination’ that I had discussed with the others last night, when Elena was out.

“…Do you understand? To summarize, first, don’t be afraid of your own power and have confidence. If you can possibly transfer your consciousness to the monster you’ve created, that would be great. Getting stronger yourself is a good way to gain confidence. Second, rather than holding back your power, it’s better to focus it all in one, creating a very powerful monster, then try to persuade it.”

“Hmm… Now I understand why the sponsor told me to talk to you. I feel like I’ve gained a clear understanding of the reason why I can’t control ‘Unfortunate Imagination’ in my daily life.”

“Is that so?”

“The jar analogy. It’s perfect. In fact, I’ve always tried to not spill even a single drop of the overflowing power inside me, but inevitably, a few drops would splash out, creating monsters with a peculiar feeling.”

“It’s probably knowledge that the chief learned during the research process.”

“Transferring my consciousness to the monster. I honestly have no idea about that. I don’t want to do it either.”

“Is that so…”

“But the second method is something that resonated with me as soon as I heard it.”

“Oh! As long as one works, it’s fine.”

“A being worth pouring all the power of ‘Unfortunate Imagination’ into. A being with endless wickedness and misfortune, but at the same time, one who can communicate with humans. In fact, there are many clear beings that come to mind. I’ll go right ahead.”

With those words, Elena immediately left to test her ability at the Safari. Did she think of something? In the end, it’s not me who uses the ability, but Elena. I can only advise, the actual solution has to be found by her. Seeing her leave with a confident expression, I felt slightly relieved. Once Party Time ends, we have to head to the incomprehensible place called ‘Frozen Hell’. Before that, if Elena can control her own power, it’s a blessing to be able to remove one of our worries before facing a great ordeal.

But… what is it? ‘A being with endless wickedness and misfortune, but at the same time, one who can communicate with humans.’ What kind of being did Elena think of, that she left for the Safari with such a confident expression?

**To be continued…**
