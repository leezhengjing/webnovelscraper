## Chapter 154 – Room 201, The Cursed Room – ‘□ □□’ (3) – Kim Ari

In the midst of the chaotic atmosphere, Seungyeop spoke with an unsure tone. 

“Should I choose the next path again? I got it wrong once. Should I use my active skill? It’s ready to be used.”

“From now on, let's call that active skill ‘Cheonun’. Don’t use Cheonun. Its cooldown is incredibly long.” 

Mookseong shared the same opinion.

“Cheonun? Your naming sense is…well, anyway, Seungyeop, your Cheonun is just a fancy name for an active skill. It's an automatically activated skill, isn't it? It activates automatically in crucial moments. It activated on its own during the strange family event, and during the Hotelgo, you got a notification saying whether or not you should use it. Just wait. It'll activate itself if needed.”

Upon closer thought, it truly was that way. The active skill of luck, now nicknamed ‘Cheonun,’ wasn’t actually an active skill. It activated automatically during crises, and even suggested its use to its owner when deemed necessary. Even its cooldown was arbitrary. It was definitely very long, but Seungyeop himself didn’t know the exact duration. To me, it seemed to change each time. 

It was no surprise, but luck is the most difficult blessing to understand among all blessings.

In the end, Seungyeop chose the next path once again. This time, it was the back door. He called Elizabeth and they moved together towards the back door. They departed towards the fourth mansion.

While walking through the underground passage, Songyi sighed and said. 

“It's a bit late, but where could Pero be?”

Mookseong, walking beside her, tapped her lightly, signifying to use the chat window. Songyi shut her mouth only then.

…To be honest, I don’t care. If that woman, Elizabeth, isn’t an idiot, she must have realized by now that we’re hiding something and that we have a means of communication only between ourselves. Just by looking at the power of the party revealed in the short time, there’s Mookseong’s gauntlet and Jinchul’s star. From the outside, it must seem weird that we act as if we’re in sync, even if we’re not exchanging any words. But even so, Elizabeth didn’t investigate it once.

…Should I shoot her from behind? Just like us, she’s wearing a full-body bulletproof suit and a helmet, so I can’t instantly kill her. She’s a combatant, so she would resist. However, we have Cha Jinchul. To be honest, I thought about whether or not it was a good idea to kill that woman right now. I slightly moved my gun barrel towards Elizabeth.

**Lee Eunsol**: Ari, stop.

**Kim Ari**: Suspicious.

**Lee Eunsol**: What do you mean?

**Kim Mookseong**: Calm down! Let’s observe a little longer. The cursed room is basically structured to be cleared through multiple attempts, right? Instead of immediately eliminating her because she looks dangerous, it’s also necessary to observe her and find out what the secret is.

I also had another worry. Since we are all ‘set up’ to have diverse superpowers, is that woman truly a normal human?  We can’t let our guard down regarding that woman’s combat strength, as she’s a Management Bureau agent. 

I relaxed my tension a little. The topic Songyi mentioned earlier began to be discussed in the chat window.

**Kim Mookseong**: Pero x from the beginning.

**Yoo Songyi**: This is a first.

**Park Seungyeop**: Is it like Gained-hyung, a different place?

**Kim Ari**: Is the location itself a red herring? 

— Thump!

Elizabeth, leading the way, opened the door of the fourth mansion. Tension returned, and the chat window stopped.

Where is Pero now? 

*After experiencing the first three mansions, we formed a hypothesis about this trial. It’s a kind of ‘spot the difference’ game in progress. The repeating mansions each have one difference. There is always a monster hidden in the difference. It attacks after a certain amount of time. Thus, as soon as we entered the fourth mansion through the front door, we searched meticulously with our eyes blazing. The first three times, we were clueless and powerless against it, but this time, we had a counter strategy, so the situation changed. Eunsol, the possessor of powerful eyes, instantly spotted the difference.*

**Lee Eunsol**: Over there! The tree in the living room! Its species is different.

We couldn’t repeat the same mistake as when we lost Elena. Immediately, Mookseong and Jinchul shot at the tree. 

— Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! 

Four or five shots hit in succession. An unusual phenomenon occurred. The tree, as if it were an animal, bled. Then, the tree sank into the floor and disappeared. 

…After that, no further special phenomena occurred in the fourth mansion. We finally learned one correct response method. After catching our breath, Eunsol instructed through the chat window.

**Lee Eunsol**: Seungyeop. Next room.

**Park Seungyeop**: A monster appears every time I choose a room. Can someone else choose instead of me?

**Lee Eunsol**: Saving characters. Nobody will blame you. Just choose. Really.

In this situation, nobody would blame Seungyeop if a monster appeared in the room he chose. After all, since we have no way of knowing how to choose, we have to rely on luck. Would it be any better if someone else chose? 

However, after monsters continuously appeared in the rooms he chose, Seungyeop seemed to be mentally shaken.

“Alright! Everyone, over here!”

A thick voice, unexpected from a woman like Elizabeth, could be heard. Everyone was startled and turned their heads. Elizabeth was opening the back door. A bewildered Cha Jinchul approached her and tried to persuade her.

“Team Leader, please wait a moment. Let's discuss where to go -”

“Discuss? Have you ever discussed anything? It’s just that little kid who keeps choosing, and a monster appears in every room he goes into.”

Everyone was speechless for a moment. We only exchanged opinions in the chat window, but from Elizabeth's perspective, it must have looked like a strange sight - everyone standing silently, then following the little kid who’s choosing the direction to go.

If Elizabeth was someone we could trust, and the situation was peaceful, we would have listened to her words. Honestly, we don’t have that luxury right now.

**Kim Ari**: Feels creepy. Let’s kill Elizabeth here.

**Cha Jinchul**: Suddenly?

**Kim Mookseong**: An impulsive judgment, unlike you.

**Lee Eunsol**: Why are you acting this way from earlier?

**Yoo Songyi**: Calm down. Everyone's against it. Songyi, you can’t even use English properly!

A sigh escaped me. I understand why everyone is against it. The reason why I find that woman suspicious is that she constantly acts alone and doesn’t react much to our superpowers. As for acting alone, it could be seen as her own way of searching. And as for not reacting to our superpowers, that’s not really unusual considering she’s a Management Bureau agent. 

Thinking rationally, it's natural for them to find me strange for suddenly wanting to kill Elizabeth just because she offered a different opinion.

The reason I keep suspecting Elizabeth…it’s my intuition! I’ve seen more of these demonic events than you all combined! An experienced police officer can sense something suspicious just by looking at the behavior of a passerby. In the same way, my instinct has been warning me of that woman’s suspiciousness since earlier.

Coincidentally, Elizabeth seemed to sense the awkward atmosphere between us and offered a compromise.

“Anyone who thinks a different route is suitable, speak up. Let’s have a proper discussion. Let’s not keep having this little kid choose willy-nilly.”

Nobody answered. To begin with, we weren’t really choosing a path based on logical deduction. No persuasive words came to mind either. Also, it’s true that a monster appeared in the rooms Seungyeop chose consecutively. Everyone seems to be thinking of finding a different method.

Something feels off. Even if he didn’t use Cheonun, isn’t Seungyeop the one who boasts about rolling sixes every time he rolls the dice? Of course, he didn’t roll sixes every time back then. It’s a matter of probability after all. But, he’s definitely lucky, so it was a bit suspicious to get two wrong answers in a row.

Thinking simply, it’s possible that he’s mentally overwhelmed, so his blessing is not working properly. But, let’s think from another perspective. What if Seungyeop is actually choosing the correct answer? What if the thought that a monster exists in every room he chooses is itself wrong?

My head got tangled again.

We walked through the familiar underground passage, now through the back door, towards the next mansion. As always, there was a door leading to the next mansion at the end of the passage. Elizabeth opened the door –

“You dumb bastards.”

Immediately, Elizabeth turned transparent and disappeared somewhere!

“Whoa! What’s going on?”

“What do you mean? I said I wanted to kill her!”

There was no time to swear any more. Instead of the mansion we had seen before, there was a huge white space, and in the center, there was a gigantic gorilla. 

— Graaaarrrrrrr!

A roar that shook the earth! This room was a ‘bomb’. Seungyeop had avoided ‘bombs’ until now! The gorilla charged towards us at incredible speed.

— Bang! Tataatatatatat!

Everyone scattered in all directions and pulled the trigger at the same time. Flames erupted from the gun barrels, and flashes of light burst from the bracelets.

An appalling thing happened. Bullets bounced off.

“Stop! Stop shooting! The bullets are ricocheting, we’ll be in danger!”

Within a short time, more than a dozen bullets were fired, but they didn’t even penetrate the monster’s skin.  The bracelets were the only effective ones. The gorilla, unable to locate our positions, floundered for a moment – then, it began to flail wildly in all directions!

Less than three seconds later, the gorilla’s fist swung towards Songyi.

— Bang!

Seungyeop threw himself in front of the fist and was embedded into the wall! Is he okay? He’s wearing protective armor, so he must be alive. I’ll hug him when we get out!

In the midst of the chaos, Songyi was horrified.

“Seung, Seungyeop! What do we do? That gorilla is intelligent. It’s just randomly -”

— Boom!

Cha Jinchul charged towards the gorilla from behind. He slammed his feet onto the floor so hard that the vibrations reached me. At the same time, a violent wave erupted in front of Jinchul, as if someone was pressing down on my skin. 

Even though it was a monster that deflected bullets, would it be able to withstand the star?

— Kaaaarrr!

A completely different reaction! In an instant, the star began to twist the gorilla’s back skin. Ore emerged from the monster’s back, and its flesh began to tear!

Seeing that, Mookseong and I fired simultaneously. Different! The skin was twisted, losing its characteristic strong defense. The bullets penetrated the body, and the gorilla let out a painful groan. 

— Bang!

“Aaargh!” 

The next moment, a bullet flew from the invisible air, and Songyi fell down with a scream.

“Elizabeth!”

Elizabeth, transparent and hidden somewhere, attacked Songyi! It seems she didn’t die thanks to her full-body bulletproof suit, but even with the bulletproof suit, the bullet’s impact couldn’t be completely nullified. There must have been a hammer-like impact.

Songyi writhed on the floor in pain, and the gorilla, free from the bracelet’s control, immediately changed direction and lunged at Cha Jinchul.

— Bang! Bang!

“Kraaaak! What the hell is this King Kong -”

Two seconds? Three seconds? The gorilla’s punch was faster than the speed at which the star killed it. It was just one exchange, but it was clear. That monster’s physical power far exceeded even Cha Jinchul’s. It was no joke. It truly reminded me of the gorilla in the movie that was wrestling with a dinosaur.

The gorilla was even smart. After knocking Jinchul away, it immediately jumped into the air –  how can it jump like that with that size? Is it the Hulk? I couldn’t bring myself to look anymore.

With a deafening roar that shook the heavens, Cha Jinchul became ‘what used to be Cha Jinchul’. It wasn’t entirely without effect. While the gorilla slammed Jinchul with its huge fist, Jinchul couldn’t even properly counterattack. But the star already summoned was steadily releasing the otherworldly wave until Jinchul’s death. It was a fleeting moment in time, mere seconds. But during that time, more than half of the gorilla’s sturdy skin was ripped into ragged flesh.

In the midst of this chaos, I… honestly, there’s nothing I can do. What can I do? Old blood has various abilities, but none of them work on such a brute. Approach him and hypnotize him? I’m sure the gorilla would turn me into jelly faster than I could hypnotize him. 

Fortunately, after the gorilla regained its senses, Elizabeth’s presence vanished completely. It seems the gorilla didn’t show any mercy to Elizabeth either.

Just as the room filled with terror, a butterfly appeared in the air.  …Truly, it was a being that didn’t fit in this horrifying space where flesh and bone were flying everywhere, a beautiful blue butterfly.  The butterfly flapped its wings slowly, as if playing, and moved towards the gorilla. The gorilla paused for a moment, as if it had just been made a fool of, then lightly waved its palm towards the butterfly –

As soon as the butterfly touched the gorilla’s palm, it sank in! Eunsol is hidden somewhere! Just like Elizabeth! From the moment the battle started, it was the first time the gorilla faltered. At the same time, the chat window rang.

**Kim Mookseong**: Ari! Now!

I immediately grabbed my gun and ran towards the gorilla’s torn skin.

**To be continued**
