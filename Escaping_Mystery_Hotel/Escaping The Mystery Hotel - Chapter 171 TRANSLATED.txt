## Chapter 170 – Room 201, The Cursed Room – ‘The Cube’ (19) Fin – Han Gain

The moment the finger descended from the vast, boundless sky like a shooting star, everything stopped. Beatrix’s song, filled with pain from a distant dimension, ceased. The noise from the books and displays fluttering in the strange space died down. The cruel god who had filled the whole world with his insane laughter fell silent. 

In the frozen space-time, the finger from the heavens pierced me, leaving me unable to even consider escaping. 

… When I came to, I realized I had returned to being the complete ‘Han Gain’.

“What in the world -” 

“Are you conscious?” A man with an intellectual appearance, looking to be in his late fifties, turned around, his face full of surprise.

“You are!”

“You’re the head researcher?  Isn’t it a bit cliché, this kind of story again?”

“... What in the world is going on here? What’s that finger?”

“It’s a kindness offered because this is the first room on the second floor.”

“What?”

“Did you fully understand the ‘sealing’ system before entering this room?”

“I heard a little from Ari, but honestly, I didn't know much. Ari herself didn't know much either.”

“You started Room 201 without fully understanding the sealing system. It’s not your fault. There’s no instruction manual for this hotel, you can’t know before experiencing it. The issue of personality distortion when you’re caught up in the characters’ ways of thinking – could you have foreseen that?” 

“...” 

“That’s why there’s this kind of consideration in the first room on the second floor.  It’s like they forcibly separated you and me. Congratulations. You’ve regained your complete self.”

“Well, that’s something to be grateful for.”

“Isn’t it funny?  This place, the hotel, is like a place that has gathered every kind of injustice in the world. And yet, this kind of subtle consideration is hidden within it.”

The head researcher pulled out a cigarette from his upper garment and slowly lit it. He exhaled a cloud of smoke that seemed to crumble from his lips. He opened his mouth again. 

“Would you like one?”

“I’ve never smoked.”

“How about trying it this time?”

“...” 

“Oh, what a boring junior.”

“I’m not your junior.” 

“Really?” 

“... It's amusing to look at your eyes. You have so much you want to say, but you don't know what to say. Isn't that right?”

“Was this really the only way?  Did you have to sacrifice Beatrix and humans?”

“You seem to dislike my methods very much.”

“You…. While I was merging with you, I thought. You treated everyone but yourself like tools.”

“One of the chronic diseases of those in high places. And you have one misconception.”

“Misconception?”

“Treating everyone but myself like tools? What nonsense. I’m the most useful tool of all.”

“...” 

“Why do you think I’m here?”

“You wouldn’t have come here on your own, to gain something…”

“Stop there. You’re not going to meet me again in your life, so why ask personal questions about me? It’s meaningless beyond satisfying your curiosity. You need to ask questions about your future instead.”

With those words, the head researcher pointed to my ‘status window’.

**Date: Day 87**

**Current Location: Floor 2, The Cursed Room – 201, ‘The Cube’**

**Sage’s Advice: 3]**

… It was the first time someone other than myself had seen my status window. The ‘Sage’s Advice’ blinked.

“This is…”

“Use advice to ask me questions. As much as I want to just tell you, I can’t anymore. You wouldn’t happen to not know how to use it, would you?”

“You’re not an owl, so why would you ask me to use advice… What in the world -”

“I told you not to ask questions just for satisfying your curiosity.  Ask necessary questions.”

“...”

“If you can’t figure out what to ask, I’ll choose for you.  The first question…  Yes, this is good.”

**‘Regarding the system of the second floor.’**

… A dry laugh escaped my lips. The head researcher, this man who seemed to have been the owner of wisdom long ago, started using my status window as if it were his own. Now he had even begun the bizarre act of asking questions and answering them himself.  But it was also true that I had a lot of questions for him. And the question was ‘the system of the second floor’.  It’s the kind of thing that would make you crazy just hearing it, isn’t it?  I decided to listen in silence.

The head researcher’s first question-and-answer session began.

“The second floor, similar to the first, has a scenario for each room. The sealing is at the center of it. The sealing is also a sealing of one of you, but it’s also a sealing of a character who plays an important role in resolving the scenario. The moment the seal is released, that character's spirit will awaken.”

“... Is it necessary to release the seal to solve the room? Not really. But it’s usually best to aim for releasing the seal. Your colleagues in Room 201 seemed to be obsessed with releasing the seal, though they didn’t know exactly why. But it was the right answer in the end. I guess they’ve all developed a kind of intuition while surviving in this hotel.”

“... The moment you break the seal, the room is basically solved. Because a being who knows the answer to the room, like the ‘head researcher’ of Room 201, awakens.”

“... However, there’s one problem – Oops. This answer exceeds the limit of one Sage’s Advice.  I need another Sage’s Advice to explain more. Do you have any other questions?”

“Just use one more and finish explaining.”

“Good idea. Let’s make the second question this.”

**‘The problems with the answer the character knows.’**

“After releasing the seal, the character who wakes up with your colleague will know the answer to that room. The problem is, that answer isn’t a very good answer.”

“Yes?”

“What do you mean, ‘yes’? You’ve been complaining to me since before. You’re asking if this was the only way.”

“...” 

“It’s the same in other rooms. The moment you release the seal, you’ll learn the answer to the room. And you’ll learn that it’s full of problems. Most of the time, you’ll be too busy to think about a better answer, like you are now. But…  if you have the time.”

“If you have the time?”

“Think about whether there’s a better answer. By the way, I believe there’s a reward for finding a better answer.”

My head became muddled. I focused all my attention on organizing what I had just heard.  The second floor, just like the first, has scenarios for each room. One of us is sealed. If you release the seal, your colleague will be released and the character who knows the answer to the room will be released as well. Therefore, releasing the seal greatly increases the chances of solving the room.  However, the answer the character knows is incomplete. If we find a better answer, we can get additional rewards. Is that about right?  While I was wondering if I had missed anything, my status window blinked again.

**‘Regarding the limits of Sage’s Advice.’**

“What’s with the silence -”

“I’m sorry. I’m running out of time.”

As he said, the frozen world began to move again.  With the cursed room solved, all spaces began to crumble slowly.

“The last answer is nothing special. You have a lot of complaints about the owl, if you recall.”

“...”

“From someone who once owed him a lot, it’s better to clear up misunderstandings. The owl doesn’t give you answers that sound like a joke just to try to get you. He has his own limitations and had no choice but to choose that way.”

“Choice?”

“Answers that are easy to understand and clear, but convey only one meaning.  And answers that sound like riddles, vague but can be interpreted in multiple ways. He simply chose the latter. It’s a way to pack more information into one answer.”

“...”

The space around us began to collapse.  The solution was coming. The end of the long, long Room 201 was approaching. As the platform where I and the head researcher stood was about to collapse, I couldn’t hold back and opened my mouth.

“I don’t want to become like you, Senior.”

“Good idea, Junior. I’m rooting for you.”

/You have succeeded! The Cube.  A strange and unknown place where people abducted from who knows where are endlessly killed by monsters.  This horrible place was created for the sake of humanity’s salvation. The root of evil that was impossible to handle, a being that couldn’t be dealt with by power or wisdom.  Those who couldn’t find a way to deal with that existence ultimately chose to beg for life by offering living sacrifices.  Was this really the only way?  Who knows.  But don’t worry! You have definitely solved the room! The monsters hidden in each room, the girl who seemed more like a living natural disaster than a human! And also, the research institute where an unknown secret was hidden.  Your exploits, defending the world from the eyes of the zero dimension after overcoming all these trials, were impressive. … … … … A member of the team has achieved final resolution! Congratulations! Because the final resolver has emerged, all members will return safely. Please decide yourselves which treasure you want to receive and who should receive it!/

???  I was reading along well, then my eyes widened in shock at the last line!  I can choose ‘which treasure’ to receive?  And also, there was ‘who should receive it’.  Was anyone else alive besides me? After the resolution of Room 101, the ‘time for choice’ had come again. Soon, the next notification appeared.
