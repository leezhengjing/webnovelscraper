## Chapter 144 – One Ticket, One Suit, One Chance

**Date:** Day 72
**Current Location:** Floor 1, Corridor
**Sage's Advice:** 3

We all woke up in the hotel corridor, together. Before we could feel the joy of seeing each other again, we were overwhelmed with a dizzying feeling as we looked around the hotel. How long has it been? We've been through trials, overcome them, only to face more trials, again and again. We haven't had a proper rest, just a continuous cycle of challenges! My mind felt completely fried, before my body even started to feel exhausted. 

Seeing my fellow companions with dazed expressions, I couldn't help but laugh.  They looked at me, and a smile crept across their faces too. Soon, laughter filled the entire corridor!

Eunsol Noona, who we haven't seen in a long time, spoke up. "Let's go get some food first! Seems like they’re going to give us our rewards after we eat."

In the midst of the cheerful atmosphere, Jincheol Hyung started acting strangely. He suddenly stared into empty space, then rapidly turned his head from side to side.

Mookseong Grandfather pointed out, "Met돼지, why are you acting so strange?  You keep staring into empty space, did you see a ghost?"

Surprisingly, Hyung answered seriously, "I've been seeing something sparkling in the air. A faint human-like figure keeps appearing and disappearing…. Did something happen while I was unconscious?"

Silence fell upon the room. Hyung had been through a lot. Everyone hesitated to explain.

As we returned to Room 105, the alarm that those who cleared Perfect Life had seen appeared for everyone else. The "Trial's Intent" written in front was interesting, but it was ultimately about the trials we already passed. It didn't really matter. What truly piqued everyone's interest was the reward description: One Ticket, One Suit, One Chance.  And a special reward for the individual with the greatest contribution.

Conversation bloomed about these items and their purpose. 

* — *Click.* After using the bathroom, I looked at the dining table and found the atmosphere lively. I sat down and watched the boy building a tower next to me. Plain donuts, topped with three slices of pork belly, topped with a sirloin steak, topped with a mix of pork cutlet sauce and grilled tomatoes, and finally, topped with a pork cutlet.

… Unable to bear it anymore, Ari spoke up, "Seungyeop, that blood vessel bomb burger is too big to eat in one bite, right?"

"It's fine." He laughed awkwardly, then looked around. Those who had progressed further were busy telling those who had been eliminated earlier how they passed the trials.  Elena, someone I never thought would do this, was proudly explaining to Jincheol Hyung and Eunsol Noona how she tricked the crew of the Esper Ho.  Of course, she didn't mention how she was almost captured as an offering at the end, or how she nearly caused a major incident in Perfect Life.

Jincheol Hyung, lamenting his early elimination, listened to our stories intently. He looked completely shocked when we told him about the witch that possessed his body and how it was exorcized. 

A peaceful atmosphere.  It's time to drop the bomb.

— *Bang!* *Bang!*  "Everyone, attention please." 

All eyes turned towards me.  "I know this is sudden during dinner, but it seems like one of the rewards has already been given."

My sudden statement stunned everyone.  The first to partially grasp the situation was Mookseong Grandfather. "You received the reward for the one with the greatest contribution, didn't you? I had a hunch."

Everyone nodded in agreement. It seemed many had guessed that I would receive the special reward. Honestly, isn't it obvious?  My contribution in the second trial, the Witch's Forest, was crucial to controlling Arima. In the third trial, Jekyll and Hyde, my deductions were key from beginning to end. I didn't single-handedly dominate the remaining trials, but that doesn't mean my role was insignificant.

"You're right. I confirmed the reward earlier." 

Everyone tilted their heads at the phrase "confirmed earlier."

"Earlier, you mean when you went to the bathroom?" 

I stood up, smiling at everyone.  Ha!  Honestly, the feeling is indescribable. It's like the joy of being a superhuman, an impossible feeling to control. 

With a triumphant grin, I raised both arms in front of everyone, focusing my energy. I confirmed the "feather tattoo" in the bathroom.  As I became conscious of the tattoo, I instinctively understood how to use it.  A flash, a bang! I appeared across the table from everyone!  

Their eyes widened -  

—  *Crash!*

… I fell from mid-air to the ground.

"..."  "..."

Silence fell over the room for a moment. Then, Ari asked, "That… was teleportation? You jumped into the air and fell, was that intentional?"

"..."  "Is it hard to control where you land? You need to practice that power."

"I can't use it again right away. I need a few hours."

"Right.  It's an amazing power.  But if you want to avoid plummeting to your death after teleporting in a crucial moment, you need to practice a lot."

I felt a little embarrassed, but I stood up and raised both hands again! "Wow! Did you see that? I can teleport now!"

Seungyeop exclaimed in admiration, "Hyung, that was like real-life teleportation."

Ari topped it off, "Now that I’ve seen that power, I'm certain. You're the first one on the second floor who's going to get sealed away."

"..."

Everyone belatedly congratulated me and dinner ended.

* Dinner ended, and the hotel predictably sent out an announcement. 

/Did you enjoy your meal?  Once again, congratulations to everyone who overcame the arduous trials. Starting today, a week from now, the second floor will be opened. On the second floor, you will face trials even more challenging than those you have encountered so far. Of course, with your skills, and the treasures you have already gathered, you will be able to break through. Please take this week to fully recover both your body and mind.  P.S. What you have been eagerly awaiting! Head to the front desk./

Songi shouted happily, "Is it a whole week this time? That's a long rest! We don't have to explore, so we can really relax this time."

She grabbed Elena's arm and added, "Let's go swimming and skiing!"

Elena was flustered and unable to hide her embarrassed expression. 

Eunsol Noona urged everyone with a frustrated look, "Let's go to the front desk quickly!"

In the center of the front desk was a giant treasure chest-like object.  Jincheol Hyung approached it, nodding his head. "Let's just open it."

He pressed a button, and the chest opened, revealing the three rewards the hotel mentioned. One Ticket, One Suit, One Chance.  

Jincheol Hyung, with a bewildered expression, lifted a red button. It was a small box with just a button attached.  Next to the 'One Chance' box, a brief explanation and its name were written: 'Escape Button.'

I stood next to it and picked up the ticket. The back of the ticket had a brief description: 
/Ticket of Wishes! Can be used in various ways.  Don’t you find it fun to discover its uses?/

What nonsense is this? Just write down the uses! This is ridiculous.  Just as I was about to complain, I noticed Ari's expression changing. A whirlwind of emotions swept across her face: a fierce impulse, an agonizing longing, a desperate desire, and an unstoppable greed.  

Ari instinctively reached out to grab the ticket I was holding, and without thinking, I pushed her hand away.

"..."  “… I’m sorry. I was startled.”

"I understand the ticket's use.  Try to calm down.  We all understand how you feel.”

"..."

Silence filled the room.  I realized that at least one of the "various uses" of this ticket was clear.  It can resurrect people who died in the hotel.

The tension wasn’t limited to the ticket.  When Mookseong Grandfather pulled out the 'One Suit,' everyone fell silent. 

It wasn't actually a suit, it was far too grand. Calling it a 'spacesuit' would be more accurate.  Of course, even a spacesuit is technically a type of clothing.  The suit, which looked like a high-performance spacesuit with exceptional durability, had a nameplate attached: 

‘Protective Suit:  Unbreakable by Swords and Blades (刀劍不侵), Impervious to Water and Fire (水火不侵)'

On the 72nd day after arriving at the hotel, we finally obtained our first escape tool.

*  We walked past the front desk and arrived at the snack table after about three minutes. This table always had our favorite drinks and snacks, but today there was nothing there. We had replaced them with larger objects.

We thought everyone would be happy and joyful after receiving the rewards, but… we all just stared silently at the objects on the table.

Eunsol Noona, trying to break the awkward atmosphere, picked up the 'Escape Button', the reward that didn't seem problematic. "Everyone read the description, right?  It’s pretty simple.  Only once! Press the button, and you'll instantly escape the cursed room.  The number of uses is counted."

No one spoke, so I replied, "It’s a tool that forces a 'escape' judgement.  Seems like it’s single-use and the count starts at five, with increasing difficulty.  Since it’s an 'escape' judgement, it should automatically revive those who died at that point, right?  As the description says, it’s a tool that gives you 'one chance'.  It’s basically like getting an extra life."

"It’s actually really nice to have something like that."

"It makes me a bit uneasy."

"What's wrong?"

"Seeing them give us something like this makes me wonder how difficult the second floor will be."

"Ah, let's not worry about that just yet."

After setting down the Escape Button, silence returned.  I picked up the ticket again. "It says it has various uses, and it seems like one of them is 'revival'. Is that right?"

I looked at Ari and asked.  Ari nodded quietly.  "Of course, I don't think it can directly resurrect anyone.  Do we need to find a place like the 'Revival Room' I mentioned before?  We might have to use this ticket in that place."

Ari spoke up.  "I don't know exactly where or how to use it.  It just looks exactly like the ticket I’d heard about before, so I recognized it."

"Okay.  So… I think we need to discuss who we’ll resurrect at some point."

Ari remained silent. 

Eunsol Noona spoke in that awkward atmosphere. "We said we'd be taking a week’s break, right?  Let's have a serious discussion on this topic sometime during that break.  But there's no need to decide right now.  After all, we haven't found that 'Revival Room' yet. It’s probably on the second floor.  Also, since it says it has 'various uses', we should try to find the other uses.  If they're comparable to revival, the other uses must be incredibly valuable."

"That's right. We should talk about it, but there’s no need to decide right now."

…  Silence again.  Eventually, everyone’s eyes turned to the most uncomfortable of the three: the 'One Suit'.

Jincheol Hyung, unable to bear the tense atmosphere, reached for the suit. “Ugh! This is so frustrating.  What’s so big deal about this?  Is someone going to sneak out at night wearing it?  Why are we so uptight?”

The other seven people, who were all thinking the same thing, flinched.  Jincheol Hyung shut his mouth as he saw their reactions and put the Protective Suit down.  Maybe I shouldn't have told them about the elevator code.

…  Let's stop there.  It's already happened.  Besides, I resolved to stop deceiving everyone.  This is just another trial we need to overcome.

I sighed and stared at the 'Protective Suit,' a hot potato.

We have a week’s break before the second floor.  We need to solidify our relationships so the likes of the Protective Suit and the Ticket can't shake us.
