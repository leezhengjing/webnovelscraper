## Chapter 175 – Party Time – Night Special Meeting, Sanctuary of Blessings (2)

**Date:** Day 89
**Current Location:** Floor 1, Corridor
**Sage’s Advice:** 3

“From now on, I’m holding the first Night Special Meeting of the hotel party!”
“…”
“…”
Silence hung heavy in the air. It was 3 a.m., an unusual time for us to be awake.
“To those who worked hard to gather everyone, Grandpa Kim Muksung, a round of applause… Well, there isn’t time for that, but thank you for your hard work.”
“What kind of meeting requires gathering everyone at this time? You even made a fuss about not using the general chat channel, making me contact each one individually. It was a pain.”
Ari provided the answer.
“There was no other way. We needed to keep some of the details from Elena. She’s sound asleep right now.”
Besides Elena, two others were missing. Seungyeop and Jincheol were fast asleep, unresponsive to Grandpa’s personal chat channel. Due to the nature of Room 105, if they didn’t wake up even with the chat channel, there was no way to call them.
“As some of you might have guessed, this meeting is to address the ability Elena gained, ‘Ominous Imagination.’ Everyone needs to adequately respond to it. Actually, we thought about doing it during the day, but it would be hard to have a meeting in the hotel without Elena knowing.”
“Hmm, it seems like you and Ari are already working on a countermeasure, right? You’re talking about not stimulating her anxiety?”
Indeed, Grandpa seemed to have already figured out our unusual actions and the purpose behind them. Songi, who only opened her eyes after hearing that, was visibly surprised.
“That’s right. Until Elena becomes proficient with her ability, we need to avoid actions like screaming or running away when witnessing strange phenomena around her. It’s dangerous to trigger her negative emotions.”
“Yeees… I’ll be careful.” Judging by Songi’s immediate response, it seemed she’d already made such a mistake.
“Good. Actually, calling everyone at dawn wasn’t just to talk about this. I’ve been going through the memories of the Senior Researcher for a few hours.”
Grandpa widened his eyes.
“Oh! Come to think of it, he raised Beatrice, right? Did you find any good methods?”
“I vaguely remember him trying all sorts of methods. Although the memories aren’t clear, I can broadly categorize them into three types. The problem is… they’re all very ‘Senior-like’ methods, so it seems unlikely we can use them directly. I wanted to get everyone’s opinion.”
Grandpa tilted his head in confusion.
“It’s about using an ability, so is it okay without Elena? I guess there’s a reason why you excluded her from the meeting.”
“That’s right. The first method is ‘Boosting Self-Esteem’.”
“What?”
“It’s nothing special. The ability’s mechanism makes strange things happen when you feel anxiety or fear. This phenomenon becomes more intense if the person’s self is weaker.”
“So, you’re saying you implant the belief ‘I’m an incredibly strong being’ to eliminate the possibility of feeling anxiety?”
“Something like that.”
“What did the Senior do?”
“Various things. Making everyone use honorifics when speaking to Beatrice, or having a few physically strong soldiers pretend to be scared and back down when seeing Beatrice.”
“… That only worked when educating Beatrice as a 10-year-old kid. It doesn’t seem like a method we can use on a grown-up girl.”
Grandpa pointed out another issue.
“It’s a method that only works if the person being educated has low intelligence. A kid under 10 years old would feel a sense of intoxication, believing they’re an Emperor’s child after experiencing such things, but Elena would just think, ‘What the hell is this?’”
“More aggressively, there’s a method of creating an overwhelmingly powerful doppelganger and transferring consciousness there. If you can destroy walls and smash heads with a single gesture, and still regenerate, you’ll rarely feel fear.”
“That’s okay, isn’t it?”
“The problem is, even Beatrice, the original owner of the ability, took over 15 years to reach the stage of transferring her consciousness to the created monster.”
“…”
“The second method is similar to what Ari and I are already doing. It’s like ‘Turning fear into laughter.’”
“Making Elena see the monsters and laughing it off together, making her think it’s nothing?”
“That’s right. Remember what you heard when you first met Beatrice?  ‘Let’s play!’  It was something like that. Beatrice’s cruel yet playful personality formed through this education process.”
Ari was the first one among us to start using this method. She sighed first and replied.
“It seems like it has its limits after doing it for a day or two. Honestly, I was surprised when the black tea was poisoned. Experiencing something like that and laughing it off is more unnatural. Of course, everyone doesn’t need to act appropriately to make Elena feel fear, but it’s not a fundamental solution.”
“Right. It’s my conclusion that there’s no easy solution. If we could easily eliminate the danger, ‘Ominous Imagination’ would be a ridiculous ability. The gorilla that punched Jincheol’s head, the gorilla that made Beatrice herself tremble in fear, all of them were creations of Ominous Imagination. Anyway, the Senior figured out a third method.”
Everyone fell silent and started listening to my words.
“The methods mentioned so far are like trying to fill a water bottle and walking around without spilling a drop.  The gigantic jar that is Ominous Imagination is always full of ‘water’ that can create all sorts of strange phenomena, and Elena is holding it. No matter how careful Elena is, the jar will vibrate with every step she takes, and the water will inevitably leak.”
“That water leaks and creates those nonsensical monsters we see often?”
“Yes. If the first two methods were about ‘how to not use the ability’, this third method is the opposite. It’s about just using all of the ability.”
Grandpa, who was tilting his head in confusion, answered.
“Are you saying we should cover the entire hotel with monsters and kill them one by one?”
“It’s not about creating that many monsters. Besides, it wouldn’t make sense if we were going to kill them all. ‘Ominous Imagination’ isn’t a curse, it’s a reward given to Elena. We need to find a way to use it well.”
“Then what are you saying?”
“Instead of creating dozens or hundreds of messy, insignificant monsters like now, we create one incredibly powerful being.  Pour all the power of Ominous Imagination into it.”
Ari’s face contorted with deep anxiety at those words.
“Is it possible that the ‘gorilla’ we saw inside the cube was created through such a process?”
“That’s right. The reason the gorilla was incredibly strong compared to other monsters is that Beatrice poured her power into it to the point where the jar was empty.”
“Let’s say we create it, how do you control such a monster? Songi’s Affinity? It seems like her Affinity hasn’t worked on those that went completely out of control.”
“The more powerful the monster, the higher the chance of a being capable of controlling it appearing.  The messy ones don’t have proper intelligence, just cruelty and savagery, but a truly strong one can possess high-level intelligence.”
“So, you’re saying we create a demon with high intelligence, and persuade it to behave? The ability’s name is ‘Ominous Imagination’, and the monster created by pushing the limit of that ominous imagination, will it behave well according to your words?”
“The Senior solved that problem very easily.”
“How?”
“If it wouldn’t be persuaded, he killed it. He made one after another, a hundred times, a thousand times, until he found one he could control.”
“…”
“It’s the perfect way to utilize Ominous Imagination if you can do it. The jar is empty, so the ability won’t leak out in everyday life, and instead of hundreds of mindless monsters, you have one extremely powerful monster that’s capable of communication.  It’s good strategically as well.”
“Thinking about it, there’s a method that the Senior couldn’t use, but we can.”
Ari pointed at me as she spoke.
“That’s right. Unlike hundreds of mindless monsters, a powerful one… If things go wrong, I can just possess it and control it directly!”
This was precisely why I thought this method was the best. Just because Elena created the monster, does it have to be controlled by Elena? It would be best if possible, but if it’s too difficult, I can control it.
The surroundings fell silent for a moment.  My sister and Songi, both outsiders when it comes to controlling supernatural abilities, remained silent.  Even Mookseong Grandpa was quiet.
Ari, the biggest expert in this field among us, opened her mouth.
“So, to summarize roughly, the three methods are like this. First, boost self-esteem.  It’s better if you can transfer your consciousness into the monster’s body. Second, don’t make a fuss around her, try to laugh it off, and avoid stimulating her. Third, create one powerful monster and control it well.  If it’s hard to control, Gain will possess it and control it directly.”
“That’s right.”
“Theoretically, they all sound plausible.  We saw a real-life success case in Room 201, too.  It ultimately comes down to what we can do.  That’s how it always is, right? Like you said, in the university entrance exam language, even if a tutor who graduated from Seoul National University perfectly explains their study methods, if the student can’t follow, it’s meaningless.”
“We need to tell Elena about what we talked about today. Ultimately, it’s up to her to choose which method to use.”
It’s Elena’s ability, so ultimately, it’s her decision. Eunsol, who had been silent throughout the meeting because of the topic of supernatural ability control, asked a question.
“Gain, did you ask for advice again?”
“Yes.”
“What are you going to use it for? It seems like you need to use it carefully this time…”
“Actually, I wanted to ask some questions about Room 104. Normally, I have to use the advice for solving the curse room, so now that it’s party time, it seems like the right time.”
“The Hotel Curse? Hmm, I heard questions about Room 104 consume three advices each.”
“Yes. I’m also curious about why that is.”
“It’s ultimately your choice to use the advice, but I think it’s not good to use too many on Room 104.”
“I think so too. My previous thought of asking lots of questions about Room 104 is a thought from the past… Now, the hotel seems to be full of intentions to freeze us, so I need to get information about that first. I’ll use it on Room 104 just once.  It’s only one, but it’s a costly three-advice question, which is a shame.”
“Good thinking. Honestly, even now, I feel a subtle chill.  We should gather information about the second floor today and tomorrow, and discuss what we should do.”
It wasn’t just my sister’s feeling. I felt the average temperature of the hotel, despite being on the first floor, dropping since a few hours ago.  Originally, the hotel had a pleasant spring-like temperature, but now there’s a cold wind blowing like autumn.  Meanwhile, Elena, who was wearing a blanket to withstand the coldness, was being rolled up like a mat and was escaping with Ari’s help. What on earth should we do on the second floor? Everyone’s worries deepened.
