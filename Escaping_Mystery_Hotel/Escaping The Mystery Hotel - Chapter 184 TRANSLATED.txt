## Chapter 183 – Prayer for the Maze (2)

**Date:** 92nd Day
**Current Location:** Tier 2, Frozen Hell – Resurrection Chamber
**Sage's Advice:** 2

“Prayer for Rest.”  Finally, aside from resurrection using the ticket, the reality of other possibilities we could pursue began to emerge.

“Guide, tell me what ‘Prayer for Rest’ is.” 

“Prayer for Rest refers to a series of processes where you pray to Buddha for a peaceful rest for the previous participant. Of course, things in this world don’t work just by prayer. Ultimately, you have to rescue the previous participant from hell yourselves.” 

“Rescue from hell? Isn’t this hell?”

“Try it for yourself.”

It felt like he wouldn’t tell us anything more about this part.

Ari, who had been observing the ice where the Maze was trapped for a long time, spoke.

“His body is here, but his mind seems to be somewhere else. It’s like he’s telling us to rescue his mind…” 

Upon hearing that, I looked again and began to understand what she meant. The bodies of those trapped in the ice statue were clearly before our eyes, but they were groaning with their eyes closed as if they were having a terrible nightmare. Should we go to where their minds were trapped?

“It’s like they’re having a terrible nightmare… what do you guys think?”

“That’s how I see it too.”

My sister answered my question, then turned to the Guide.

“It doesn’t seem like something we all do together, does it? Tell us more about this! The sponsors already mentioned something related!”

“Hell is originally a place where the living cannot go. However, Buddha’s mercy has no end, so incense for salvation is prepared. While the flame of the incense is maintained, the living can also enter hell, but the flame of the incense is only maintained while those left behind pray.”

Simply put, it meant that we would divide into parties, some would pray and maintain the flame of the incense, and while the flame was maintained, a few others would go into hell to rescue the Maze.

Ari, who had been quieter than usual, asked again.

“What happens if the Prayer for Rest ritual is successful? Will the previous participant be released from the hotel? Can we still resurrect them after the ritual is successful?”

“Rest and escape are separate. The previous participant will be released from the chains of pain, but they will not escape outside the hotel. Likewise, rest and resurrection are also separate. Just like we can resurrect them regardless of the outcome of the prayer, we can also resurrect them after the prayer.”

It was easy to understand that resurrection through the ticket was possible regardless of the outcome of the prayer. However, what did it mean that they would be released from the chains of pain, but not escape the hotel? The previous sentence was hard to understand. Anyway, the meaning that ‘pain’ would end was clear, and a spark of life lit up in Ari’s expression.

Ari turned awkwardly towards us and muttered in a smaller voice than usual. 

“We agreed on this together in the past. Resurrection is out of the question before we find a way to restore Maze’s mind. I still agree with that part. In this dangerous place, being with someone who is not in their right mind is something no one can handle. However…”

Prayer for Rest, unlike resurrection, didn’t use up a consumable ticket, and there was no risk of the mentally unstable Maze joining the party, making it a perfect option for Ari.

Before she could finish her sentence, my sister answered.

“Prayer for Rest, let’s do it.”

“…”

“We should. As you said, we should decide on resurrection after we find a way to restore his mind, but we need to end his suffering.  We originally came to normalize the second floor, right? Whether it’s resurrection or prayer, we have to do something to normalize the second floor.”

I quickly agreed with that part.

“I think so too. According to the scenario understanding, the hotel is frozen because of ‘the resentment and suffering of those who died in the hotel’, right? Whether it’s prayer or resurrection, we have to appease that resentment and suffering for the hotel to normalize.”

“That’s right, and…”

“And?” 

Instead of answering, my sister stared at Maze’s statue, which endlessly emitted groans, then looked back at Ari. I understood the meaning behind that action. 

Would Ari be able to continue running the hotel with a clear mind, knowing that Maze was suffering this pain? She might sneak into Frozen Hell one day, steal a ticket, and resurrect Maze. If Ari started acting that recklessly, what would Grandpa do? Would we be able to ignore the suffering of a fellow member with whom we’d been breathing together for an immeasurable length of time?

Prayer for Rest, for Ari, would be a ritual to end the suffering of her mother, Maze, but for the rest of us, it was essentially a ritual to prevent ‘Ari and Mookseong’s departure’.

After a while, preparations for the ritual for Maze began.

“Gain!”

“Sister?”

“Let’s split the party. I think what the sponsors have been telling us and your advice is related to party classification.”

“That’s right. It seems like some will go to hell, and some will stay and pray.”

“It seems like the ones going to hell…”

She trailed off, her voice softening.

It seemed like going to hell was the tougher job. Based on the information we’d received so far, it seemed like Ari, Grandpa, and I would go, right?

“I think it’s better if I go. Elena and Seungyeop were clearly told that you guys wouldn’t go, but I was told to go. When information is lacking, it’s best to follow the advice of the sponsors.”

“Good! Well thought. And there’s something I definitely need to tell you.” 

My sister glanced at Ari, who was far away with Grandpa, looking at the incense and asking various things.

“Do you have something to say?”

“It’s about Maze. I don’t know where or what you’ll do, but it seems like you’ll go to where Maze is.”

“That’s right.”

“If possible, try to understand what kind of person Maze is. It seems like Maze’s problem doesn’t end with today’s prayer. The prayer just ends the suffering, right? It’s not like he’s escaping the hotel or being resurrected. Ari will definitely want to completely free Maze.”

“… I’ll try.”

“It’s not just about trying, you have to judge it for sure. I can’t believe anyone else’s words except yours. A daughter or a former comrade can objectively see what kind of person her mother is.”

“…”

“Go and see with your own eyes. What kind of person is Maze, and is he a person worth resurrecting? Focus on his mental state as much as possible.”

“I understand.”

Soon, an incense of unknown origin appeared in the heart of Frozen Hell, and a mat and a small dark room formed around the incense.

“Do we go inside that dark room to pray?”

The Guide answered yes to my brother’s question.

My sister muttered with concern.

“We need to start praying right away?”

“Sister, let’s all eat first. We need to eat our fill before we do something dangerous.”

“The food has all gotten cold, but let’s eat. We need to eat something.”

While chewing on rice lumps that wouldn’t even chew well, Ari, Grandpa, and I gathered separately and started a separate meeting.

“Ari, I don’t know what kind of work ‘rescuing Maze from hell’ is, but you’ll probably meet your mother?”

“Probably. It seems like we’re going to where Maze’s mind is trapped.”

“Tell me everything you know about Maze. What kind of superpower does he have?”

“Hmm… it’s not easy to explain.”

“It’s hard to explain?”

Ari thought for a moment and replied.

“First of all, don’t believe my explanation too much. I never met Maze when he was normal. Let’s start with his simple strength, physical ability. He was definitely stronger than an average person.  About this much?”

As she said that, Ari stretched out her hand and grabbed my arm tightly. 

… She grabbed tightly. I couldn’t move at all.  I’d guessed this before, but Ari, despite her size, is stronger than me.

“How does it compare to when you use all your strength?”

“Because it’s the same origin of power, it’s similar. However, it’s incomparable to Jincheol, and weaker than Mookseong’s arm.  Well, that physical strength is less important than his superpower.  That power is not an easy-to-understand ability like your teleportation or my psychokinesis.  If I had to classify it, it’s like an incredible charisma?”

“Charisma?”

This time, Grandpa answered.

“He’s the kind of person who can easily persuade people and always stirs everyone up like the main character.”

“Is that a superpower? There are plenty of politicians or entertainers like that, aren’t there? Or is he controlling people’s minds?”

“Controlling minds? It’s kind of like that, but it’s not quite that either. It’s just like his charisma and leadership have been amplified to supernatural levels.  It’s hard to say definitively.  A rough summary would be something like, he was the kind of person who could become the leader of any group, even among people he’s never met before?  That’s why he was infiltrated into the hotel.”

If he was someone with the power to become the leader of any group instantly, even among strangers, he was literally the perfect talent for the hotel. Although, he seems to have messed things up spectacularly.

Ari, who had been quiet for a while, spoke up.

“I found out about my mother’s superpower after escaping the hotel. I knew about the inheritance or blessing, but…”

“If it’s a superpower like leadership or charisma, it would have been hard to use properly after infantile regression. It seems like it’s an ability that requires some intellect.”

“I just remembered, there’s a kind of nickname for my mother.”

“What is it?”

“‘The Princess of Fairytales’.”

“That expression is kind of cute…”

Grandpa chuckled wryly.

“It’s a nickname that’s partially given because she’s pretty, and the other half because she’s self-centered and capricious like a person from a royal dynasty.”

“Hearing that makes me nervous again. You said there are other superpowers, right?”

“There was definitely some kind of unknown power. The problem is that these powers seem to be separate, but from another perspective, they seem to be in the same direction, so there’s an opinion that they’re all derived from a single power.”

“He was a Management Bureau agent, but there’s a lot of ambiguity about his ability, isn’t there?”

“To clearly identify his abilities, a certain type of experiment is necessary, but because of his ability’s nature, Maze had a lot of ‘followers’ within the Management Bureau.  Because of them, they couldn’t properly research Maze.  In fact, despite everything, Maze was loyal to the Management Bureau, so the leadership didn’t want to treat him harshly.”

‘He was loyal to the Management Bureau.’ As soon as those words came out, Ari reacted.

“You’ve only been talking about negative things, but no one doubted Maze’s loyalty to the Management Bureau. Most of the negative stories are about his personality, and in terms of his actions, he’s saved countless people from evil beings his whole life.”

This part is a good story. Anyway, it meant that during the time when he was sane, he adapted well to organizational life and had enough basic morality.

After listening to Maze’s information from the two of them for a long time, the only things I learned were that he had a bad personality and his abilities were ambiguous.

Just like when the incense and dark room appeared with a ‘Thump!’ sound, a door appeared. Even without asking, we knew what that door meant. Ari, Grandpa, and I exchanged glances and headed towards the door. It’s time to enter Maze’s hell.

“We wish you a merry Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas, and a happy New Year!”

My mind snapped awake to the cheerful carol. The surrounding scenery was somehow familiar. A clean bed, a bookshelf full of books, and a luxurious wooden desk. A small space, about 15 pyeong, while still a bit small, was large enough for one person to live comfortably.  As I felt it the moment the carol began playing, snow was falling outside the window. Not as blizzard level as the second floor of the hotel.  It was quite different from the word ‘hell’.  A lot of children could be seen joyfully playing outside, as if it were normal.

After checking the surroundings, I turned to myself. 

… Looking in the mirror, I looked at least two or three years younger. I looked like a teenager, about 15 years old at best. I was wearing a uniform, no matter how I looked at it. Looking at the scenery and my own appearance, I seemed to have become a student at a boarding school…

Questions began to arise.  Why is this place ‘hell’? Where are Ari and Grandpa? And Maze?  

As my question marks grew, a chat window appeared.
