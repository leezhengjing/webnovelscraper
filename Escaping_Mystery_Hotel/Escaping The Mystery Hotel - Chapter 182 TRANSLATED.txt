## Chapter 181 – Party Time – Entering the Frozen Hell (8)

**Date:** Day 91

**Current Location:** Floor 1, Room 105 – Room of Rest

**Sage’s Advice:** 3

– On the third day of the Han Gain party time, we began our final preparations before entering the Frozen Hell. On the other side, my sister was checking everything written in her notebook, making sure nothing was missing. “Jincheol! Have you ever set up a tent?” “I have. It’s actually easier to set up than the one I used in the army. I can do it in a flash.” “Songi! Check your sleeping bag and winter clothes, especially your sleeves. I saw your sleeves were about to rip again.” “Ne-eeeng….” “Elena, why don’t you practice your powers more? Gain and Ari said it’s a little scary right now. Sometimes, individual training is the best teamwork.” “I, I will?” “Grandfather! You seem to be packing only greasy meat.” “I know better. This is what you need when you go to a cold place.” “Then do what you want. And Gain!” Oh dear! My turn has come. I was already packing food into my backpack beside my grandfather. “I’ll pack this diligently -” “No, you don’t need to pack that. Now, use your advice. It’ll be evening in a few hours. You’ve probably decided what to ask, right?” As he said that, Ari, who was naturally doing something similar to sewing with Songi, came closer. “It would be nice to relax a bit during the party time. So, what are you thinking of asking?” “It’s a three-part question, and I’ve been thinking about how to ask it since yesterday, but it’s tricky. I have no idea about the Frozen Hell, so I don’t know what to ask. I thought about something like ‘What kind of place is the Frozen Hell?’, but such a vague question -” “Perfect for the Owl to play around with.” “…Yeah, right. I’m afraid it’ll just give me a vague answer like ‘It’s very cold.’ So I thought about a good question and came up with one. I still don’t feel like it’s the best choice, though.” “Why do we have a three-part question in the first place? It’s making choosing the question even more exhausting.” “Actually, I asked about that part yesterday.” “Oh? What did it say?” “‘Questions that exceed the limits of Wisdom’s Authority will consume all three chances.’” “…It feels like it’s trying to sound helpful but not telling us anything. It doesn’t say anything about why a particular question is exceeding the authority. So far, there have been two cases where we used all three chances: Room 104 and the Frozen Hell.  Both were outside the limits of Wisdom’s Authority? Why? Both are facilities within the hotel.” “I don’t think asking about that part is meaningful anymore. Maybe it means we should figure it out ourselves. Anyway, here’s what I’ll ask: ‘How should I deal with the Frozen Hell?’” “Instead of asking what kind of place it is, you’re asking how you should deal with it? It’s a more specific question, so we’re likely to get a more concrete answer.” “Right. What do you think?” “It sounds good. Ask it now. It’ll be dinner soon.” ‘How should I deal with the Frozen Hell?’ … Maybe it sensed my frustration with the vague answers it gave. Thankfully, it gave a more detailed answer this time. “What did it say? What did it say?” I could sense the others, besides Ari, were also listening intently. I explained it loudly so everyone could hear. “The Frozen Hell is the beginning and end of everything, perhaps a place where you can fulfill your wishes. Breathe together with experienced people. That’s what it said.” Everyone fell silent for a while, interpreting the meaning. I started with the first part that came to mind. “First sentence: the beginning and end of everything, a place where you can fulfill your wishes. It seems like a description of the Frozen Hell itself. It’s hard to understand the meaning of this part clearly.” My sister immediately chimed in. “The next sentence is relatively clear. Experienced people… I think we know who it’s referring to.” I also understood the meaning of the last sentence. It’s about dealing with supernatural events, and there’s only one person among us who can talk about ‘experience’ in this kind of situation. My grandfather reacted. “It’s clearly talking about me and Ari, isn’t it? Gain, the advice you received is quite different from what Elena heard from her sponsor.” “Elena said she was told ‘This isn’t something for you to do.’ ” Next to her, Seungyeop interjected softly. “Actually, I think I heard something similar.” “What did you hear?” Seungyeop seemed to rummage through his memories before answering. “‘Not everyone needs to participate.’, ‘You don’t need to push yourself.’ Was it that? I was a bit angry at the sponsor back then, so I’m a bit hazy about it.” He’s finally telling us this important information! I was momentarily speechless, but I just sighed because it was Seungyeop. Besides, how could he get angry at the sponsor – oh, that’s a feeling I have five times a day, so let’s skip it. “So, it seems like it’s not something we all need to do together, like the Cursed Room?” “Gathering the information, it feels that way. It’s not something we all do together, only some of us.  The sponsors seem to think that Elena and Seungyeop aren’t suited for this, but it seems like it’s perfect for you, me, and Ari.” “There must be a reason they chose us three, not anyone else.” We don’t know exactly what’s going to happen, but we’re starting to get a general idea of what needs to be done. It’s not a team play where everyone participates like the Cursed Room. It’s not something for Seungyeop or Elena, but a task suited for Han Gain, Kim Ari, and Kim Muksung. It’s something that requires ‘experience’ in handling supernatural events. We shared our opinions on these points and other things that came to mind, and the last day of party time flowed by smoothly. The next day, we headed to the Frozen Hell. *

– Woo-ooong! Hoo-ooong! This wind is really something. I’ve been to the second floor many times, but I still can’t get used to it. But now, we’re somewhat prepared. At the front, Eunsol, our guide, is leading the way, wearing a protective suit. Jincheol is in the back, keeping an eye out in case anyone falls. Everyone in the middle is holding the white ends of the curtains that we ripped and tied together.

Eunsol: Here! Come here!

We were walking silently, following the signals in the chat window, but suddenly, the surroundings went quiet. “Huh? Did we arrive?” “Yeah.” “Wow! How is this possible?” “Unnie, you did a great job!” “Thanks. Let’s take a breather and either open this terrifying door or whatever we need to do.”

As we heard, the space where the Frozen Hell’s door was located was quiet and peaceful. There weren’t any physical walls or doors, but it felt like a transparent wall was protecting only this space. “What will happen if we open the door? Will we all be sucked in like the Cursed Room, right as we open it?” “I don’t know… This doesn’t feel like something everyone needs to do together, does it?” “That’s not just a feeling, it’s certain. Elena and Seungyeop said they were told to stay out of it, right?” “That’s why I don’t think we’ll all be sucked into the inside like the Cursed Room.” “Okay, everyone, have some of this. Unfortunately, there are no individual cups.” Ari handed out hot coffee from a thermos to everyone. We relaxed with a cup of coffee, settled our minds, and looked at each other, giving each other encouragement. My sister looked around and said one last thing. “We don’t know what will happen, and the hotel itself has become dangerous, so we’re all coming together… but it doesn’t seem like something we all need to do, right? So, if you feel it’s not for you, back off. We don’t know what might happen.”

It’s time to enter. /Enter the Frozen Hell?/ *

… This place is filled with nothing but suffering.

– H-huu-uk! He-he-e-e-k! My vision was filled with countless frozen statues. Every statue emanated cries of suffering that could fill the whole world. Each one was trapping a ‘living being’. 

We were utterly stunned by the surreal and horrific sight of the Frozen Hell. At this moment, even the excruciatingly cold energy felt less chilling than the second floor of the hotel.

Songi was the first to regain her senses, having already experienced something similar. “It’s similar to something I saw in a Human Farm somewhere. There are many humans, but there are also beings that aren’t human.”

Ari grabbed her fluttering clothes and muttered as she looked around. “What is this? Is it some kind of alien specimen room? Even by the Management Bureau’s standards, there are too many alien creatures whose identities are unknown. And there are many humans too. Also, it’s incredibly cold, but I can see things better than on the second floor. I wish I couldn’t see this spectacle, though.”

… No one else spoke for a while. Then, somewhere in our vision, something began to flicker. /Scenario Understanding (!)/

“It worked again.” “Huh?” “Scenario Understanding. It just popped up. I’ll press it right away.” /Scenario: The Sound Heard in the Frozen Hell The hotel group entered the Frozen Hell through the mysterious door on the second floor. They were stunned to witness the horrific spectacle of countless sinners trapped in the entire hell.  A path appeared, as if to guide them. Follow the path./

After confirming the content, I looked straight ahead, and indeed, something resembling a path was visible. “Over there, that’s the path. It’s narrow, but it stretches straight ahead. Let’s follow it.” One by one, my dazed comrades got up and began following the path. 

– A-a-a-a…!

The voice filled with suffering came from right next to me. I couldn’t help but turn my gaze. The sight of a person with black hair trapped in an ice statue, screaming in agony, entered my vision. What era was this person from? Judging by their attire, it couldn’t be anyone from the 21st century. They were twitching, as if they were sleeping, but unable to control their body. Were they having a terrible nightmare?

“Gain, don’t look at it.” “Ah.” “If you keep looking at every single one of these, you won’t be able to move forward. Don’t get too caught up in it. Just keep moving.” “…Okay.”

Following Ari’s advice, I forced myself to keep my eyes forward and continue walking. 

After about 20 minutes, the scenario flickered again as we followed the path. /Scenario: The Sound Heard in the Frozen Hell The group, following the path of the Frozen Hell, discovered an unbelievable statue! Now, they realize the true nature of this place. Why did the hotel’s second floor freeze? Perhaps the sorrow and suffering of those who died in the hotel was the source of the cold./

At the end of the path we were following, there was a small statue. It was just big enough for a teenage girl to fit in. Inside, there was a girl who looked exactly like Ari. Ari sat down in front of the statue.

Everyone was speechless. At that moment, I confirmed the true nature of this place through the status window.

In Greek mythology, Orpheus went to the underworld to bring back his deceased wife, Eurydice. Ultimately, to resurrect the dead, one must go to the place where the dead reside. 

Finally, we arrived at the place where resurrection of the dead is possible.
