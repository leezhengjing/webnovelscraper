## Chapter 184 – Prayer for the Labyrinth (3)

**Date:** 92nd Day

**Current Location:** The Labyrinth of Hell

**Sage's Advice:** [2]

We wish you a merry Christmas

While listening to the endlessly tinkling Christmas carols, I moved towards the location indicated by the dialogue window. I was sure of it within five minutes of leaving the room and starting to walk. This place is a boarding school. A boarding school from a long time ago in England or America.

— Click!

As I entered the room, which in modern times would be considered the "teachers' lounge", Grandfather and Ari were already there.

“Oh! You’ve come. I thought you might have gotten lost.”

“I was looking around on the way here, so I’m a bit late. As I walked, the information the hotel implanted in my mind started to come back to me.”

“Alright. Here, say hello to your sister.”

“…”

“…”

Neither Ari nor I smiled. Ari and I are inexplicably set up as twins.

“… Honestly, we don’t look that much alike.”

“You idiot? We’re not twin brothers or sisters, we’re siblings. We’re fraternal twins, so scientifically speaking, it’s normal for us to not look as alike as siblings with more than the usual similarity.”

It’s not even that, honestly, we look like different races. Ari’s appearance is quite surreal, so it’s hard to say for sure, but it feels like a mix of Western and Eastern blood. I, of course, am not. 

I figured as much. If the place is a hotel, then most things are just what they are.

“What school is this anyway?  Considering the situation, it’s from America or Britain — ”

“The time period is probably the early 1980s, and the school name is Eastwood High School. It’s America.  As a reference, you probably thought of this too by now, but we seem to be set up as transferring students just recently as freshmen, so keep that in mind.”

I was also figuring out the basic setting in real time, and I knew the school name and country right away. But the time period…. This information doesn’t seem to be from the knowledge implanted.

“Do you happen to know this school?”

Ari confidently nodded.

“It's the high school where Labyrinth appeared, but their academic system is not like Korea’s 6-3-3 system with six years of elementary school, three years of middle school, and three years of high school. It’s 5-3-4, so for us, we’d be considered third-year middle school students rather than freshmen in Korean terms.”

“Seems like you know a lot.”

Ari’s expression suddenly became wistful.

“I wondered what kind of person Labyrinth was on Earth, so I looked into it for quite a while. Labyrinth went through very tragic and terrifying things at this school. It’s around this time. Around this time, he was rescued by the Administration, and became a member of the Administration at a young age.”

Right now is a time when Labyrinth experienced very tragic and terrifying things during his school days. Hearing that, the true nature of this “Hell” began to vaguely come to me.

“It’s no coincidence that the time period where Labyrinth experienced his greatest fear is being replayed, is it?”

“…”

Perhaps the events that happened during this time were the ‘first’ chaotic disaster Labyrinth experienced in his long life. He might have seen all sorts of hellish tragedies while working for the Administration, but nothing could compare to the shock of his first experience as a child. The true nature of this Hell is none other than the repetition of the most painful moments from the confined individual’s life.

… Who could it be? Who creates such a painful place and cruelly treats so many?

I took a deep breath and returned to reality.

“You’ve said you tracked down Labyrinth’s past, so do you happen to remember what kind of ‘accident’ he went through?”

Ari smiled wryly.

“Originally, I naturally knew. Originally.”

As expected, the hotel had temporarily erased only the part of Ari’s memory related to ‘what happened to Labyrinth’. It wasn’t surprising at all.  They couldn’t possibly have allowed us to enter knowing the answer beforehand. 

“Anyway, it’s advantageous that Labyrinth’s childhood is the setting. At least Labyrinth won’t be able to run amok with the inheritance he got from the hotel.”

“Run amok…. Our task is to save Labyrinth. Not to subdue him.”

“It is about saving him, but as I've heard so far, it’s the person we’re supposed to save who feels the most dangerous.”

“And you haven’t noticed yet, but Labyrinth isn’t the only one without an inheritance.”

As soon as I heard those words, I tried to summon the magic book, but I realized something. Nothing came out. It seems like the thread connecting the magic book and me has been cut from the start.  Like some of the rooms where the inheritance was sealed, this place also doesn’t allow the use of the magic book. Does that mean we should try it only with the blessings? 

Fortunately, the wing tattoo and the pen were intact.

Grandfather slammed his hand on the desk.

“Move now. You have to go to class starting this afternoon. Find Labyrinth, and if possible, search the school. However, you’re limited as students, so don’t take unnecessary risks. If you get caught by security, it will be a lot of trouble. I’ll handle the active search.”

It’s probably easier for a teacher to move around than a student. After dividing the roles roughly, we left the teachers' lounge.

While walking down the hallway with Ari, I couldn’t hold back my curiosity any longer.

“There’s something that’s been strange to me this whole time.”

“What is it?”

“This school. You said the setting is the 80s?”

“Yes. I don’t specifically remember what year. It seems like the hotel erased that memory as well.”

“You're older than me, so it’s your mother's childhood, how can it be the 1980s?  It’s not just that this school is strange, it's that the first party you experienced, or the things said in Perfect Life… Everything always feels ‘off’ in terms of the ‘time period’.”

Ari smiled instead of answering.

“… Before, I think it was before we entered the gate room? Didn’t we make a promise? Instead of hiding and concealing things from each other — ”

“I can tell you about this for sure. First, this isn't my personal secret. Second, there’s no problem with this at least in this hotel. Third, you'll naturally know the answer when you go outside.”

Ari seemed like she didn’t want to say anymore and passed by me.

That afternoon, I met Labyrinth for the first time since entering the hotel.

“During the War of Independence, the Iroquois Confederacy faced its greatest division since its formation….”

“The six-tribe alliance split apart and pursued independent paths….”

… I feel numb.  If it were math or science, I might have been able to handle it, but I’m listening to the details of the history of Native American tribes from American history that I’ve never heard of, and my mind just goes blank.

— Bang!

Something jolted me back to reality.

“Teacher! Let’s take a break.”

It’s not break time, it’s class time. Not caring about such trivial matters, the girl who openly demanded a break didn’t even wait for the teacher’s response.  Soon, students started taking something out of their bags and eating.

“Oh, well! Was the lesson boring?  I should have made it more interesting. Labyrinth, what stories do you find interesting?”

“Let’s just eat our sandwiches.”

“Okay!”

What does ‘okay’ even mean? This isn’t a classroom, is it? This is the moment when the authority of teachers crumbles! The student arbitrarily interrupted the class and started eating snacks, and the teacher is encouraging this insane scene.  Watching this, the Confucian dragon inside me began to spew flames of fury.

Labyrinth, regardless of the situation, started to whip up the children like a queen bee among a swarm of bees with every gesture he made.

“Hmm. Thomas, do you want a sandwich?”

“Yes! I want one!”

“Stand on your head for 30 seconds! If you can hold it, I’ll give you a bite.”

Soon, a white boy started to stand on his head to eat a bite of the sandwich Labyrinth had left over. I couldn’t stand watching this insane spectacle any longer.

Han Gain: Your mother is amazing.

Kim Ari: American kids are like this.

Han Gain: Don’t make American kids into crazy people as you please.

Kim Mook Sung: Saving on words! 

Ari and I couldn’t even think about stopping this chaotic atmosphere, and we couldn’t find a way to jump in. More importantly, it was a very dangerous situation because if we tried to jump in carelessly, we could get caught up in it as well! After all, from a certain perspective, it was no different from a situation where a kind of mental pollution was spreading.

When the next class began, even more ‘freestyle’ events started to happen.

— Thwack!

“Haha!  Eight, it’s a knuckleball!”

“Headshot!  Nice!”

“Labyrinth! Over here, over here!”

“The ball is rolling!  Aaa!”

The chaotic sound of snowball fights coming from outside was very enjoyable. More than 20 children were rolling around on the floor, covered in snow, and Labyrinth, like he was possessed by a major league pitcher, was taking them down with every throw.

A truly blissful scene. Except for the fact that it’s currently math class time. Of course, it seems like it’s no big deal. The teacher was outside throwing snowballs with them. The only people left in the classroom were those who were sick, those who wanted to sleep because they were sleepy, and Ari and me.

“… Labyrinth had a very happy school life.”

“Isn’t Labyrinth super cute?”

Watching Ari, who seemed to have already developed a crush and was looking at her own mother’s past with affectionate eyes, I was speechless.

“Isn’t he a little out of control?”

“He’s a middle schooler. It’s a time when you’re usually clueless.  And he isn’t really doing anything bad. It seems like he just likes to play around.”

— Whizz!  Thwack!  Bang!

A snowball from outside hit my head.

“…”

“Uh… fun, right?”

Kim Mook Sung: Ari, can you come out for a sec?

Grandfather suddenly called out only for Ari.  Did he find some kind of suspicious trace? Ari, who had been panicking after seeing me get hit with a snowball, immediately went out as if she had been waiting for this moment.

— Whizz!  Thwack!

Second time? This is not a coincidence.

“No? Who is it! I said I’m not going out — ”

“Are you really not going out?”

When I turned my head towards the window, I realized that a girl who looked like a snow fairy was smiling at me from across the window.

“…”

“Why aren’t you coming out? Let’s play together! It’s no fun being alone there.”

“I said I’m staying right here….”

“It’s more fun if we all play together.  Come on, come on!”

I started to feel fatigue, so I just turned my gaze towards the classroom. I have no intention of studying middle school level stuff again, but I also don’t feel like going outside.

“… You’re not listening to me.”

?

“Look into my eyes.”

I feel my head getting numb. My consciousness feels like it’s floating, as if I’m dreaming. I unconsciously turned my head and met the eyes of a fiery red glow. Those eyes. They’re similar but different from Ari’s eyes that I’ve seen many times. They’re a bottomless whirlpool, deep and deep again. The blessing of someone who was born from above.

“You are my friend. Friends should follow me.”

Why am I constantly acting against my will?  Is it rational caution? Or is it an instinctive fear that my weak mind feels in front of a predator?  There can only be one friend. I am Labyrinth’s friend, so it’s natural that I should follow him.  This is the law.

“You’ll have a good time with me.”

Aha! My heart feels clear now.  How much fun will I have if I follow Labyrinth? Let’s go outside.  Let’s go outside and have a snowball fight.  The discomfort I had been feeling earlier was completely erased in an instant, and that space was filled with utter peace. I happily got up and headed outside –

— Bam!

“Aaaaaargh!”

“Don’t be an idiot! Do you think I’d still fall for this shallow trick?”

I immediately slashed Labyrinth’s eyes with the pen and ran out into the hallway.

To be continued.
