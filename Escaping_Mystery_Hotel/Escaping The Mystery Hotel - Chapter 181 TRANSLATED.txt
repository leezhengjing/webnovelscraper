## Chapter 180 – Party Time – Natural Selection (7)

**Date:** 90th Day
**Current Location:** Floor 1, Room 105 – Room of Rest
**Sage's Advice:** 1]

Elena hadn't returned for almost two days since the Party Time began.  While the others initially assumed she'd be back for lunch or dinner, their concern was growing.

"Song-yi, have you checked downstairs?"

"Yes. I waited for her, but she kept going in and out of the Safari for a little rest. I even asked if she wanted to eat. She said she was almost done, but she still hasn't come out."

"This is tricky. Since she said she was almost done, it would be weird to force her to come back."

If this was a critical moment for Elena's ability development, it was best not to interfere.

"Let's wait a bit longer. I think she'll be back with good news."

"Hopefully, Gah-in, you're right. By the way, have you used all your advice?"

The second advice was "Tell me what else to prepare." The answer we received was "Prepare food."  This unfortunate fact meant we wouldn't be having decent meals for a while after the Party Time ended.  As a result, everyone was busier packing food than eating dinner.  I saw Jin-cheol, my older brother, stuffing a plate with grilled pork belly.

"I'm still thinking about the third advice. I'll use it after I've decided for sure."

"Okay. Let me know the answer after you ask."

Song-yi approached me and my older sister. 

"Um, I saw Elena when I was waiting to bring her back.  She kept going in and out of the Safari."

"Really?"

"...Every time she came out, she was wobbly and had a bad expression.  She told me to stay away."

My older sister and I didn't react, but Jin-cheol's expression darkened.

"This isn't good."

"Something's wrong?"

"Noona, if you want to practice your ability, you can stay inside the Safari. Why would you keep going in and out?"

"Um, maybe she's tired?"

As expected, Jin-cheol, the Safari veteran, immediately figured out the answer.

"She keeps dying. The Safari sends you out again when you die.  She's unsteady because of the stress each time she comes out."

Everyone's expression turned dark upon hearing this. Even though we had become numb to death after passing the Room of Curse, pain is something we can never become accustomed to.

Ari immediately shoved me.

"No way. You go get her."

"No, I go, she won't come.  You or Eun-sol noona should go -"

"Just go get her quickly."

**Glossary:**

* **Safari:** A training ground within the hotel, used for ability development.
* **Party Time:**  A period within the hotel when guests can train their abilities and compete with others.
* **Noona:** Older sister, a term of address for an older female.
* **Hyung:** Older brother, a term of address for an older male.

Ultimately, I went down to the basement to bring Elena back, forced by Ari.  I was prepared to wait until she came out, but thankfully, she was there.

"Elena!"

"..."

She didn't answer.  Elena's expression was strange. As I approached, she suddenly waved her hand at me. What did it mean? I ignored her and continued walking, but she grimaced and yelled.

"Don't come! It won't help if you come!  If you hadn't recommended I get this ability -  Mother!  I apologize!  Ah!  Aa! I'm sorry.  You just had to come right before 'Perfect Reflection' activated!  What to do..."

She suddenly yelled at me, then apologized and almost cried before I could even react. It was hard to understand what was happening, but I felt the need to do something.  ...But what should I do in this situation? It felt childish, but I briefly clasped her hand.

Gradually, Elena's sobbing stopped, and the emotional storm subsided.

"Are you okay?  You haven't eaten all day, and you kept going in and out of the Safari. Everyone was worried. And your reaction just now...you don't seem to be in good shape."

"I'm okay now. And what's with this?  Elementary school?"

"..."

— Thud.  She seemed to be getting better.  Elena shook my hand away and chuckled.

"I've been practicing all day, and I realized that 'Ominous Imagination' makes you crazy.  It's as if the ability itself constantly stimulates your trauma.  You have to think ominous thoughts to activate the ability, and after activation, the ability itself makes your mind murky."

"...The side effects seem worse than I thought. Based on your words just now, I was wondering if I could -"

"No, don't worry about that. Please. I was half-crazy and babbling nonsense before 'Perfect Reflection' recovered me!"

Elena grabbed my hand again and stared at me intently. I couldn't help but nod.  It seemed like she wasn't really serious about her earlier words.

Anyway, 'Perfect Reflection'. Wasn't that the new skill Elena acquired?  Reading my curiosity from my expression, Elena explained to change the topic of conversation.

"Perfect Reflection stabilized my mind like a bucket of ice water when my heart became too murky.  I thought I was going crazy after using the ability over and over again, suffering from all sorts of delusions, but it brought me back to my senses within three seconds."

"That's an amazing ability.  But can't you use 'Perfect Reflection' beforehand to protect your mind while using 'Ominous Imagination'?"

Elena smiled wryly.

"You think like everyone else. That's the first thing I thought too.  Sadly, 'Perfect Reflection' can't be used consciously. It activates afterward, when I'm already going crazy, to calm me down."

"Aha, so it's not a power that protects you beforehand from attacks, but one that fixes you after being attacked.  Then why don't you try getting help from Song-yi's bracelet?"

Elena burst out laughing.

"I met Song-yi earlier, and she said the same thing. It's impossible.  'Ominous Imagination' isn't about your mind going crazy while using the ability, it's an ability that requires you to be crazy to use it."

I understood what she meant. In short, it's an ability where you must be engulfed by madness in order to use it.  Therefore, if you try to defend against madness through various means, you won't be able to use the ability.  That's why the patron's 'strengthened blessing for supplementation' wasn't an ability to block madness, but one to recover from it.  It's a tiring ability in every way.

With such a heavy penalty, it should have commensurate power. Elena had been starving all day?  I was worried about her, so I took her to the refreshment table on the first floor.  Ari, who seemed to have been waiting for us, approached and immediately asked.

"Elena! You worked hard. Did you make any great monsters?"

This girl doesn't hold back!  She asked right away! I was too worried to ask if my hard training hadn't yielded any results.

"I made something pretty docile..."

"Oh! Already?  Elena, are you a genius of the century?"

"...Don't tease me."

"What kind of monster is it?"

"It was completed in a way that's hard to understand."

"What does that mean?"

"Um, it's hard to explain. It's like you kind of understand, but you don't understand."

"You're making me more curious! Can you show us now?"

Elena seemed to be contemplating, but she soon nodded.  She seemed to be secretly feeling a sense of accomplishment and wanting to show off a little.

"I used most of my strength in the Safari, but I can show you a bit. It's small, but it'll feel similar!"

She looked around for a moment.

"Are you looking for something?"

"Yes. An image?  A memory?  I need a mirror or a window to recall it clearly..."

A mirror?  A window?  There was something similar on the other side.

"It's not a mirror or a window, but there's a 'main entrance'.  It's a transparent glass door, anyway."

Does it have to be a transparent glass? Elena nodded and walked towards the door.  A moment later, silence descended upon the hotel. Seung-yeop, who had been chattering somewhere, fell silent.  The carbonation from the cola I was drinking quieted down.  The creaking sound from Ari's chair stopped. 

In the midst of this inexplicable world where all sounds ceased, Elena, who had brought the monster, spoke joyously.

"Oh, it's a bit small, but it came out. Don't you think it's cute?"

...I couldn't breathe. Elena, who had returned to the table, had a caterpillar with a human head protruding from the chair beside her. The caterpillar emitted strange noises.  The caterpillar's head rotated 360 degrees. Eyeballs appeared and disappeared from the rotating head.

Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!

"Ugh! I'm going crazy!"

Right before my mind completely went, I managed to cover myself with the status window filter.  My vision blurred, and my hazy head became somewhat clear.

"Ah...ahh..."

A weak groan.  I turned and saw Ari sitting there, making strange noises.  A sudden accident!  Elena had said she could control it, and didn't she say she didn't have much strength left? We didn't expect something so terrifying to come out.

Elena was just as flustered.

"What?  What's going on?  Why - "

"Elena, can you make it disappear?"

"Suddenly!  I didn't use that much strength.  It'll disappear on its own in about twenty minutes."

"Then take it with you.  See you tomorrow."

"...I don't understand what's happening. See you tomorrow."

Elena disappeared, taking the monster with her.

— Swoosh!

As soon as Elena left with the monster, I immediately grabbed a cup and poured a glass of water on myself and Ari.

"Ah."

"Are you okay now?"

"...Thanks.  I'm wide awake."

"What was that?  It's cute? Is Elena still crazy?  She said 'Perfect Reflection' worked, right?"

Ari mumbled, looking dazed.

"I think I know."

"You know?"

"It's natural selection."

The concept of evolution suddenly popped up.  I looked at her, demanding an explanation, but Ari just stared blankly for a while.

"Explain."

"...Elena was in the Safari all day. How many times did she make a monster like that?"

"At least dozens."

"Dozens, maybe even more failed creations.  Elena would keep rejecting monsters she didn't like, making them over and over again with different feels. It's a kind of natural selection of monsters.  It's just that the selector isn't nature, but Elena."

"...So, through that process, a monster that looks docile to 'only Elena' was born?"

"Probably.  Elena isn't crazy.  That monster probably looks like something cute to her.  Based on Elena's behavior, it looks like a small child to her?  We all saw a different appearance from that monster."

It's a complex issue.  I had been careless, but the experience of both me and Ari being overwhelmed by the terrifying aura of that monster was a bad one.  Despite that, there's also a sense of relief.  It seemed like it listened to Elena, and more importantly, it seemed very useful.  It's not the time to be worried about the power to create monstrous creatures.  After all, the ability I gained itself is the ability to steal other people's bodies.  In a game, that's not a hero's power, but the power of a wicked dark wizard! Thinking this way, my heart gradually felt at ease.  After all, it's 'our' weapon.  The ugly and terrifying aspects are actually advantages.  If we can handle a monster like that, it will be a huge help in overcoming the hotel's trials!

I finished my cool cola, shook off the bitter memory, and stood up to go back to room 105.  As I did, I thought about what had just happened.  I had seen the specter of 'the unborn', the one I had fought so hard against in room 102.  Perhaps because it was the monster that left the biggest impact on me, it manifested this way.

...What did Ari, who had been working for the Management Bureau for decades, see?
