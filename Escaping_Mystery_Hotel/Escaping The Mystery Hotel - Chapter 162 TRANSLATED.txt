## Chapter 161 – Room 201, The Cursed Room – ‘The Cube’ (10) – Second Attempt, Kim Ari

Everyone froze at the mention of ‘Han Gain, Chief Researcher’.  She was supposedly sealed, but she had a role in the scenario? Oliver continued explaining.

“Actually, I only heard about the Arizona team, I don’t know much about them.”

“Cut the crap, just explain.”

“Yes, sir. Beatrice was discovered in the vicinity of North Carolina sometime in the 1990s. She exhibited strange abilities from the moment she was found.”

“What kind of abilities?”

“I can’t reveal specifics as it’s classified, but I heard she had the ability to create monsters. However, at the time of her discovery, her ability was flawed, so the Administration tried to eliminate her rather than utilize her.”

“Flawed?”

“Apparently, she couldn’t control the monsters.”

I understood. If you could only create monsters without controlling them, it was no different from a natural disaster. It wasn’t something you could use as a weapon, it was a priority target for elimination.

Mook Seong asked with interest, “They seem to have fixed the flaw?”

“That’s what I heard about Han Gain, Chief Researcher. He apparently used some method to allow Beatrice to control the monsters she created. However... judging from the situation, there seems to be a serious problem still.”

“He successfully made Beatrice able to control monsters, but he couldn’t control Beatrice herself.”

“It seems that way.”

Song Yi asked, pondering, “Is Beatrice's power limited to creating monsters? Does she not possess superhuman strength like pulling someone’s head off with her bare hands, or durability like treating bullets like BBs?”

“What? As far as I know, Beatrice is just a normal human girl aside from her ability to create monsters.”

Huh? That’s weird. The Beatrice we fought was ridiculously strong, to the point that it made you wonder if ‘monster creation’ was her secondary ability. She ripped my head off with her bare hands and treated a barrage of assault rifle bullets like a refreshing shower, her physical strength sent chills down our spines.

Eun Sol replied nonchalantly, “She must have enhanced her ability. Our Chief Researcher Han Gain must have worked hard on his research.”

“Oh come on. What has Gain Oppa done? Making the enemy stronger?!”

While they bantered, Seung Yeop asked seriously, “Did Gain Hyung make Beatrice stronger? Before we entered the hotel?”

I sighed involuntarily and smacked the back of his head. “Will you please just be quiet? Oliver, do you know anything else?”

“I’m sorry.”

“Then let’s get going. We need to go to that TV room. And check out the rules of the room at the same time.”

We all stood up and decided to examine the room.  Five seconds later, disaster struck.

“Ah, ahhh!”

Before we could stop him, Oliver opened the refrigerator, thirsty from all the talking he’d done. The living refrigerator, instead of storing food, decided to store Oliver.

We hurriedly smashed the refrigerator, but in that short time, Oliver had transformed into a well-aged frozen sausage inside the refrigerator.

"..."

"..."

Song Yi said dejectedly, “He’s an NPC, but I hoped he wouldn’t die since he gave us a lot of information...”

“This guy’s a bit reckless. We haven’t found the monster in this room yet.”

“... Oliver was the first one to die in the first attempt too, right? We thought Elizabeth tricked him then.”

Mook Seong sighed and concluded, “It seems this guy isn’t meant to live long.”

Eun Sol shook her head and said, “He chose the wrong job. It seems like the Administration isn’t for people who make a lot of mistakes.  Anyway, we’re busy. Let’s find the rules of the room quickly. It makes sense that Gain said we shouldn’t rely solely on Seung Yeop’s shooting.”

“I’m not sure about this, but what about destroying the mansion?”

“We’re going to fight Beatrice for real this time. Destroying the mansion would take a long time, and there’s no need to weaken ourselves from the start, right?”

“Hmm... we need to think of another way.”

* – Kim Ari

After thoroughly searching the mansion for about 10 minutes, I realized... I have no idea.  There’s no way we can figure out where the front door, back door, and underground door lead just by searching the inside of the mansion, is there?  From experience, I feel like we’ll be told to move soon. I’m curious what will happen if we ignore it...

Eun Sol, who was sitting beside me, suddenly spoke, “Maybe we can figure it out by analyzing the relationship between the entrance and exit doors.”

Entrance. Exit. That’s a good point.  Eun Sol and I meticulously recalled our memories of the first attempt and wrote everything down on paper.

In the first mansion, we went underground after hearing ‘Go down’.  Then, we entered through the front door of the second mansion. In the second mansion, the monster was hiding in the carpet. Elizabeth tried to lead us out through the back door, but Seung Yeop chose to go back to the front door of the second mansion. Then, we entered through the back door of the third mansion. The third mansion was the TV room. After Elena committed suicide in the TV room, Seung Yeop chose to go back to the back door of the third mansion.  Then, we entered through the front door of the fourth mansion. The trees were weird there.  At this point, Seung Yeop completely lost confidence. Elizabeth dragged us to the back door of the fourth mansion and led us to the gorilla.

!!! I found two rules!  At least we can tell the difference between rooms with weak monsters and rooms with super-strong monsters like the gorilla – 

— **THUD!**  What the...?

“Aha ha! I knew this was right! Come on, everyone!”

“Kya! You’re becoming a real boar, you little rascal!”

Startled, Eun Sol and I ran towards the source of the sound.  Cha Jin Cheol had stripped Seung Yeop of his protective suit and was swinging it around the mansion, using it to demolish the outer wall.  The hotel that gave him the protective suit probably didn’t expect him to use it as an ‘indestructible hammer’.

Beyond the demolished outer wall of the mansion, there was an opaque wall, and through it, we could vaguely see the situation of another room connected by a passageway.

“Kya! Wasn’t this the idea my grandpa recommended? This kind of sense, did you gain it from all the years you spent rolling around the Administration?”

“It’s obvious, isn’t it? It’s like a reflex.”

Cha Jin Cheol and Kim Mook Seong were praising each other, so incredibly close now, it made my eyes water.  Eun Sol, who was next to them, crumpled the paper she had been diligently scribbling on into a paper airplane and flew it away with a disappointed expression.

* – Lee Eun Sol

— **THUD!**  **BOOM!**

“This isn’t it. What’s that?  Noona, what is that?”

“... It’s a huge snake. It’s probably the gorilla’s friend.”

— **RUMBLE!**

“Oh! This way, everyone!”

It’s so easy. I remember back when Ari and I were racking our brains, analyzing the Cube’s rules.  By considering the location of the entrance and exit doors, Seung Yeop’s choices, and Elizabeth’s choices, we managed to find a few rules. Now that I think about it, it was a waste of time. It’s much easier and more reliable to just break down the wall and look directly into the next room.  Of course, that’s easy for me. I’m saying it’s easy for Jin Cheol.  When I was a kid, I watched the movie ‘Cube’.  I vaguely remember those characters battling each other intellectually, researching the rules of the rooms and their relationship to the laws of primes.  Now that I think about it, they were all weak and that’s why they had problems.  They could have just smashed through the walls with their fists, but they couldn’t do that and they all died.  It’s a shame.

After moving this way four times, we reached the TV room.

“Wait! We’re here. Jin Cheol, come here for a sec before you break down another wall.”

“Ah, we’ve arrived?”

“Yes. You probably don’t know because you’ve been blindly smashing walls without checking, but…”

If we go closer, the TV will activate.  There’s no need to approach it.  Soon, Grandpa’s glove flew over and grabbed the remote near the TV.  Then, we all approached the TV, and as if waiting for us, the TV turned on.

/Line-/

As soon as the ‘line’ sound was heard, Grandpa used his glove to press the mute button.  The display began to flicker.  Now it’s time to separate the party.

“As planned, Grandpa and I will go through the TV.”

“Unni! Fighting!”

This is kinda cute. I patted Song Yi’s head once, and then went through the display with Grandpa –

“Wait, wait a minute.” Ari grabbed me.

“What’s wrong?”

“There’s something I need to think about. No matter how much I think about it, Elizabeth’s answer was weird.”

Elizabeth’s answer? Didn’t she say that we could just walk straight ahead after passing through the display, with our eyes closed?  I don’t know what she means by ‘weird’. But Ari is perceptive.  Everyone waited for her to speak.

After a moment, Ari suddenly took out a syringe and started drawing blood.

“Ari?”

Ari didn’t answer, but instead, she handed the syringe filled with blood to Grandpa and me.  Confused, I was about to ask again, when Grandpa grabbed my arm.

“We’re better off not knowing.”

“Right. I have a feeling about this. But, you two are better off not knowing.”

How can I argue with that?  I had no choice but to expect an explanation later, and with Grandpa, I drank Ari’s blood.  The famous medicine that Gain was said to drink regularly, Ari’s blood tasted bitter and salty.

Eun Sol and Mook Seong disappeared in front of us, going through the TV display. The two ‘adults’ among us had left.  I need to trust them... but I feel like I’ve just been abandoned.  Strangely, Mook Seong seemed more childish and anxious than Eun Sol.

“Ari-yaaa…”

“What?”

“Why did you suddenly make those two drink your blood?”

“Because of what Elizabeth said.”

“You said her answer was weird from the start, right? What was weird about it?”

The others seemed curious too.  I looked at the ceiling for a moment, recalling what happened.

“At the beginning of the conversation, she said it herself, didn’t she? ‘I don’t know why you’re curious, there’s no danger beyond the TV.’ ”

“Did she?”

“She did. That answer was weird from the start. The fact that there is danger beyond the TV isn’t just our guess. We already confirmed it through Elena, who went through the TV once and came back. But Elizabeth said there was no danger, and that wasn’t a lie.”

“That’s strange.”

“What’s even stranger is what came after.  She herself said there was no danger, but she explained that we should ‘pass through the screen with our eyes closed’ when entering the TV.  That action is a kind of safety rule, a precaution. She says there’s no danger, but she’s acting to protect herself from danger.”

“That’s really strange. It goes beyond just being mistaken, there’s a contradiction in her own knowledge.”

“That’s why I made a guess.  Maybe ‘not knowing about the danger’ itself is a way to avoid danger.”

“You have to not know about the danger?  That’s why you did something to the blood.”

“It’s just a guess. I’ll ask her later after we leave the room.”

— **BANG!**  **BOOM!**

While I was talking with Song Yi, a wall-breaking sound echoed.

“Cha Jin Cheol!”

“Hmm?”

“Slow down a bit from now on.”

“Don’t worry, I’m managing my stamina.”

“No, it’s not about your stamina, it’s because we need to break mirrors from now on. We sent people beyond the TV, so now we need to find the room where Beatrice is.”

“Ah, right!”

Ah, right?!  I was momentarily speechless at his nonchalant response, as if he’d completely forgotten about the plan.  Well, if he’s strong enough, maybe he can take a break from thinking.  From then on, we waited, resting while we searched for a mirror in the mansion that would display ‘Move!’ until it appeared. Then, we broke the mirror and continued.

When we reached the seventh mansion, a ‘different message’ appeared on the mirror.

Did you find me?

Ha! Now it begins! 

Come out, you coward.

To be continued…
