## Chapter 151 – Entering the Second Floor

**Date: Day 80**

**Current Location: Floor 1, Corridor**

**Sage’s Advice: 3** 

– As expected, the hotel announced that the second floor was now open. We were peacefully reading when we stopped at the last sentence.  ‘The second floor is not well heated. Please be aware that it may be somewhat cold.’ … We immediately looked up and saw people bursting into laughter or grabbing the back of their necks. “How cold do they mean when they say ‘somewhat’ cold?” Grandpa Mu Sheng asked, sounding exasperated. “These bastards would call Antarctica a warm place!  It’s definitely going to be freezing to death if we just go in!”

Naturally, everyone's eyes turned to Sister Eun Sol.  Her expression turned pale. "Don't look at me!  I used all my HP Market purchases!  I didn't buy anything weird, either.  The hotel didn't even warn us in advance about this!  I packed my bag full of essential supplies!"  

“Sister, calm down. No one blamed you. When will you have more purchases?” 

“It will take three more days. And my vacation is over. If I wait here for three days, the hotel will do all sorts of crazy things!"

Amidst the panicked atmosphere, Grandpa’s calm voice came through. “Calm down. If they're going to be so cheap, we'll just give them a taste of their own medicine.” 

What does he mean by "giving them a taste of their own medicine?" I turned to Grandpa Mu Sheng.  He was eyeballing the hotel's luxuriously decorated curtains. Seeing his actions, I instantly understood.  “Everyone, grab blankets from your room. Let’s use the hotel's supplies to make makeshift winter clothes."

Everyone quickly scattered to the hotel.  Some rushed to get the fabric from the front desk or the entrance, while others went to room 105 to collect blankets. Someone seemed to be grabbing tablecloths. I also joined the "mischief," tearing down as much fabric from the hotel as I could.  To be honest, I didn't feel any guilt at all.

After nearly 30 minutes, a pile of soft fabric taller than a person was stacked in front of the elevator. We used knives, scissors, and tape to roughly assemble them into makeshift winter clothing.  Compared to real winter clothes, they were heavy, uncomfortable, and looked ridiculous, but they were warm enough, so we thought it was sufficient. 

Everyone boarded the elevator wearing their comical outfits.  This is it.  The real second floor.  Finally, we are moving on to the next stage. We briefly laughed at each other and joked around before Sister Eun Sol pressed the button for the second floor.

— *Whee-ee-ee!  Whee-ee-ee!  Ding!*

We finally reached the second floor after 80 days at the hotel.

*How should we interpret the hotel's terminology? My opinion aligns with Grandpa Mu Sheng's. We need to interpret their terms "universally." The average temperature of the universe is close to absolute zero, which is -270 degrees Celsius.  At the same time, the universe is overflowing with stars with surface temperatures exceeding 5,000 degrees Celsius.  From this perspective, the hotel's ‘somewhat cold weather’ could include Antarctica, where it is -50 degrees Celsius, and ‘somewhat warm water’ could include lava exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius.

— *Whooooong!*  

As soon as the elevator doors opened, an unimaginable icy chill swept through the air, as if freezing us alive!  We stood frozen, unable to take even a single step out of the elevator, caught in the ferocious wind that felt like it was tearing our skin apart.  Even more shockingly, the scene before us was a blizzard, despite the fact that this was supposed to be a ‘hotel’!

Sister Eun Sol, horrified, quickly closed the elevator doors.  Everyone's anger erupted the moment they closed. 

“Are they crazy?!”

“There's no hotel in the world that has snow falling inside… This isn't just a heating problem!” 

“We'll freeze to death before we even reach the cursed room?” 

"I think I can handle it."

Everyone’s eyes focused on the man, Brother Jin Cheol.  Unlike us, he hadn't shown much change in expression.  Could the power of his blessings have strengthened his resistance to the cold? He calmly spoke again.  “It's just a pretty chilly winter day for me. I'm actually surprised by everyone's reaction."

“I'm okay too!”

“Seung Yeop, you're wearing a protective suit, of course you're fine. Shut up.”

"Yes…"

"Let’s go back to the first floor and discuss this.”

After returning to the first floor, we devised a new plan.  The makeshift winter clothes we had hastily made certainly helped, but they weren't enough to withstand this kind of cold for an extended period. We wouldn’t even be able to hold on for an hour.

Brother Jin Cheol spoke again.  “Let the rest of you stay here.  Gae In and I will go up to explore.  Gae In, wear the protective suit.”

“Of course! Gae In is needed for exploration because she has advice.”  A Ri immediately pushed me towards Brother Jin Cheol.

Moments later, I was wearing the protective suit and heading back to the second floor with Brother Jin Cheol.

*  “It’s amazing how I can't feel the outside temperature at all with this on.” 

"What?!”

“W-w-w-w-ith th-th-this on, it's n-n-n-not c-c-c-old!"

"What?!” 

No reply.  I simply gave up on the conversation and started walking.  Within a minute of leaving the elevator, our conversation was completely drowned out by the deafening noise of the blizzard. Even communication through the chat window was impossible.  Is it because Grandpa Mu Sheng is on the first floor?  The physical distance doesn’t seem that far... I don't know. This hotel constantly surprises me with its mysteries.

I tried to explore the second floor, but it was very challenging.  The protective suit completely blocked out the cold, but it couldn't shield me from the blizzard's effect on my vision or the inconvenience of movement.  With no visibility, it felt like I was exploring with my hands instead of my eyes. Brother Jin Cheol, fearing he might get lost, kept holding onto the back of my protective suit and following me.  

I could sense a few things. First, the second floor is incredibly vast. It's definitely much bigger than the first floor. It's wider horizontally and the height is incomparable. I couldn’t see the ceiling at all.  In fact, I couldn’t even understand how the ‘snow’ was getting in. 

About 10 minutes into the exploration, my hand, moving along the wall, hit something with a ‘thud.’  I pointed my helmet towards the area where I felt the contact, and I saw the number ‘201’ behind a giant chunk of ice.  I had finally found the first room on the second floor. I gestured to Brother Jin Cheol, leading him towards the ice.  He understood and initially tried to break it with his hand. He gave up after a while, pushing me back and summoning a star for a moment to melt the ice. 

Since we had found the room, we decided to stop exploring for now. With no visibility, continuing our journey would only increase the chance of getting lost.  Perhaps things would be better if Sister Eun Sol, with her powerful eyes, wore the protective suit and explored?

While returning to the elevator with Brother Jin Cheol, I was feeling frustrated and angry, so I sent an advice message.  ‘You crazy bastard! Is the second floor always like this?’

*Construction in progress.* An unexpected word appeared.  Should I try sending more advice?  I hesitated before giving up.  We might enter the cursed room today. I need to save my advice points.  Of course, I’m likely to be sealed anyway, but you never know.  Someone else might be sealed instead.  In any case, it seemed that the blizzard raging on the second floor wasn’t normal, even by the hotel’s standards.

We finally reached the elevator after wandering around for quite some time. 

*As soon as Brother Jin Cheol and I emerged, everyone rushed towards us. Before answering their questions, I handed the protective suit to Sister Eun Sol and asked her to explore again. As she nodded and went back up to the second floor, the others started asking questions.

“How was it?”

“Did you find anything?”

I shared the discoveries I had made. The blizzard obscuring our vision, the remarkably vast space, the location of Room 201, and the mention of ‘construction in progress’ from the advice message.  Brother Jin Cheol, who seemed to have simply followed me blindly, also unexpectedly explained a lot.  He doesn't know the exact meaning, but he thinks the second floor is divided into multiple zones.  I had initially dismissed the frozen ice as just ice, but it seems it’s actually a type of wall dividing the areas.  Brother Jin Cheol added his opinion.

“Hearing the words 'construction in progress' makes me realize something. The current state of the second floor is like an unfinished building.  There were supposed to be several rooms here, but they're still under construction, so the areas are poorly divided. The barrier between the outside and inside isn’t complete, so that’s how the snow from outside gets in.”

Song Yi muttered in disbelief. “What kind of hotel invites guests while it’s still under construction?”

“Well, if this is a hotel where monsters roam and entering a room takes you to another world, then it makes sense that they would summon guests while the construction isn't finished.”  Seung Yeop offered a different perspective. 

“Construction in progress.  Doesn’t this seem like a kind of ‘repair event’ in RPG games?  The hotel’s repair quest has been triggered.”

I chimed in, also unable to believe it.  “Guests have to do repairs? The hotel?”  

Saying it out loud, I realized it was typical.  This place is full of those kinds of things. 

A Ri sighed and spoke. “Okay, okay! Let's figure out what we need to do right now.  It doesn't matter if it's a repair event or whatever, but our vacation ended yesterday.  We need to go to the cursed room today, or the hotel is going to throw a special event at us!”

Grandpa Mu Sheng also had a suggestion. “It seems like this repair event is something we need to do during the party time.  If it’s a situation where they’ll let us off the hook for entering the cursed room while we're working on the repair event, then it wouldn't be so bad, but there wasn't any notification about that, so I’m just saying…”

We were discussing our options when Sister Eun Sol came back.  The information she had gathered was mostly the same as ours, but there was one strange detail. 

“There’s no ceiling?  I saw a mountain through the ceiling.”

“I’m not sure.  The blizzard was so bad that I couldn't see clearly.” 

Grandpa sighed deeply. “It’s getting worse and worse.” 

Sister Eun Sol looked at us and asked, “No matter what, we need to go to the cursed room today. Should we head directly to Room 201, the one Gae In found?  If we all run towards it, wearing these ridiculous winter clothes, we might make it there before freezing to death.” 

I pondered for a moment, but there was no other choice.  As Grandpa said, we should think about how to fix the second floor properly during our rest period.  I couldn't find any other rooms, and the fact that ‘Room 201’ was the only one not too far from the elevator supported our assumption. 

It seems the hotel’s intention is for us to solve Room 201 first and then acquire the party time during which we can fix the second floor.  

Ultimately, we had no choice but to sprint toward Room 201.  Seung Yeop, the most fragile among us, was wearing the protective suit, while the rest of us were in our makeshift winter clothes, running frantically.  Though it was a short run, less than 10 minutes, it felt as if ice shards were flying at my skin.  The cold was so intense that we didn’t even have time for words of encouragement.  

Brother Jin Cheol, leading the charge, immediately opened the door to Room 201. 

* **Date: Day 80**

**Current Location: Floor 2, Room 201 (Cursed Room – ㅁㅁㅁ)**

**Sage’s Advice: 2** 

– *Brr-r-r-r* … Foam bubbles rise up from all sides.  I felt like I was trapped in a giant test tube.  People outside are scurrying around.  Are they researchers of some kind?  I faintly opened my eyes and heard voices shouting.  A hotel notification popped up in my vision, saying something about ‘sealing’.  Looks like I’m the first target.  Just in case, I tried summoning my magic book, but there was no response.  A Ri’s words came to mind: I can’t escape on my own.  They didn't even tell me the room’s name. Will I only know after my seal is broken? ... My consciousness is fading.  Everyone, do your best. I’m going to rest for a bit.  See you in the next chapter.
