– When I brought up the true nature of this place, the identity of the snow globe, both Grandfather and Jincheol hyung were startled and looked around. 

“It’s real! I understand now after hearing your words. This sight! We didn’t notice because we were inside, but it’s the snow globe itself.”

“Ugh… Gained, when you say that, now that I think about it, even these opaque walls are curved. They’re just so big, it took us a while to notice, but it seems to be covering the whole space like a dome?”

While the two of them looked around with confused expressions, Ari asked, “You, does your status window show the location?”

“Yeah.”

“What does it say?”

“Hanbing Hell – Room of Resurrection.”

“Eh? What are you saying? It’s been a while since we left that room. No, wait! Maybe this place is also -”

“Wait! Don’t misunderstand. I’ve used the status window for a long time, so I roughly understand the principle. If you were thinking that maybe this place is also an extension of Hanbing Hell, then that’s a misconception.”

“That’s exactly what I was thinking… Then what do you think it means?”

“It’s a matter of location name update.”

“Location name update?”

“The location information appearing on the status window updates when you enter an area that corresponds to the name designated within the hotel. What I’m saying is, if you’re in location A and move to location B, but there is no name designated by the hotel for location B, then the status window location information will continue to show A. Taking the first floor as an example, ‘corridor’ is a case like that.”

“Corridor?”

“If we think about the corridor, we’ll imagine the long space in front of the cursed room on the first floor, but according to the status window, even if you leave that area and go to the terrace, it’s still a corridor. Even if you go near the front entrance, it’s still a corridor. It’s just a corridor. There doesn’t seem to be a separate name for the terrace or near the front entrance. Only near the information desk is there a separate name.”

“Ah. I get it. We passed through the first floor earlier, and since we went near the Room of Resurrection to warm ourselves up, it changed to that location, and the location didn’t update after that?”

“That’s right. And there is an important meaning to this.”

After looking around at the vast expanse of snowfields, I added one more thing. 

“This place doesn’t have a name designated by the hotel. That’s why the location information didn’t update even though we walked for such a long time.”

Both Ari and I fell silent. Hyung and Grandfather, who were talking about this and that nearby, also became quiet. Yes. It’s all good. It’s pretty surprising to learn that this place is inside the snow globe, and it’s also interesting that we’ve entered a place that the hotel hasn’t even named. But what now? We’re not in a situation where we can just wander around out of curiosity, are we?! When you discover a place this mysterious, shouldn’t someone come out and say, “Dear customer, congratulations! We’ll give you this kind of reward!”?

The colleagues who were thinking similar things started speaking again. 

“What should we do now? Do we just say, ‘Wow, it’s mysterious! It’s amazing!’ and go back to the hotel?”

Absolutely not.

“Think back to the situation when my advice came out. The owl used up the entire advice stack to give a hint, feeling that this was something we absolutely shouldn’t miss. Immediately after giving it, the drone brought up the story of ‘crossing the line’. There’s definitely a meaning to this place.”

“I think so too. Finding a hidden place like this means there should be a hidden reward to go with it…”

— Thump! Grandfather hit the wall again.

“Let’s break this.”

“…”

“Is there any other way? And look at the ‘thump’ sound I made just with my fist. It’s not some invincible barrier that absolutely won’t break. We can definitely break it.”

“Something feels uneasy… What might be outside the snow globe?”

“I don’t know what’s out there. But considering the circumstances, why did your owl send us out? It must mean that it wants us to go out.”

Jincheol hyung also agreed.

“Gained, you’ve never really played games so I don’t know if you know this, but in games, chests are made to be opened and walls are made to be broken. As Seungyeop often said, this hotel has a subtle game feel to it. This wall is definitely made to be broken.”

There was nothing else we felt like we should do. In the end, we decided to break the wall and go outside the snow globe. The moment we made that decision, I couldn’t help but feel my curiosity running wild. What’s outside the snow globe?

After everyone stepped back from Jincheol hyung, he summoned a star shard. Even though we were wearing protective suits, the waves that ignored them lightly tickled our skin for a minute.

— Bang!

A part of the wall collapsed, opening a door to the unknown world. And a notification appeared before everyone’s eyes.

/Warning! If you go outside, the patron’s blessing will no longer be able to protect you. Do you wish to leave?/

“This means…”

“It’s a story within the expected range. I vaguely remember seeing this notification when I rode the escape tool and got out of the deep sea.”

The only one among us with escape experience didn’t seem surprised and reacted saying that he had seen this notification too.

“You lost your blessing when you escaped before too? Did you have any legacies?”

“I still have the legacy.”

“So after escaping, only legacies remain. The legacy is something we obtained, something we own, but the blessing is an external power given by the patron to help the participant’s progress in the hotel?”

“It’s not exactly like that.”

“What do you mean?”

Grandfather continued the answer.

“There were also cases where they maintained the blessing but didn’t have any legacies. Maybe it was just someone who didn’t get a legacy…”

“So it’s a case-by-case basis?”

“Yes. You will understand my words now. After all, the number of hotel escapees that the Management Bureau has secured is small, and even among them, it’s not like they all knew the hotel extremely well and escaped. It’s more common for them to have only understood a small part of the hotel and escaped due to luck. Because of this, the information about the hotel that they gave to the Management Bureau is chaotic and full of contradictory information.”

It seems like whether you have any power when you go outside the hotel depends on the method of escape. One thing that’s clear is that if you go outside the snow globe, you lose the ‘blessing’. In the opposite interpretation, it’s understood to mean that separate powers like legacies, my instant movement, Grandfather’s gloves, etc., still remain. Now that we’ve come this far, there’s no way we can back out. With determination in everyone’s expressions, we went outside the snow globe without hesitation.

The status window gradually began to blur. The notification, like the one that appears when a program is shutting down, appeared alongside the power that had accompanied me in most places since I entered the hotel, disappearing. Next to me, Jincheol hyung muttered, “I’m… weak. It’s a really strange feeling. Before, I could always fly into the sky just by putting a little strength into my legs.”

Ari replied lightly, “It’s not that you’ve become weak, you’ve just become ordinary. You’re still stronger than normal people. Fortunately, the protective suit that Gained is wearing is still the same. By the way, look at that. I expected it, but it’s really a snow globe. It’s even pretty.”

After moving a little distance away, we looked back at the place we had come from, and we were once again amazed by the fact that it was truly a snow globe. A huge snow globe, as if it were a small world compared to our size. It was the only object that emitted light in the darkness, so we could faintly feel its shape.

Jincheol hyung looked around and said, “Where is this place? It’s so dark around here? What can you see?”

“The only object that emits light around here is this snow globe. There are no other light sources even when I look around. Is there no sun or moon either?”

Grandfather muttered in a tense voice, “If this place is, for example, an alien planet, it wouldn’t be strange if there was no sun!”

“Gained, take a look at the ground. What do you think this material is?”

I squatted down for a while to feel the material of the ground, then slightly tore it off, thinking, “Maybe…?”

“It feels like wood. Is there oil on the wood? It’s shiny.”

“헉!”

Startled by the groan coming from the other side, I turned my head and saw Grandfather pointing at something without being able to speak.

“Why are you doing that? What’s over there – hup!”

The space that was clearly just darkness when we looked around earlier. A gigantic eye that could make your heart stop appeared out of nowhere and was staring at us. The eye didn’t blink even once. In extreme tension, everyone froze like statues. I gathered all my courage and moved in front of everyone. If something happens, it should happen to me. Slowly, the eye began to approach us. Should I retreat? What kind of creature is that?

…

As it got closer, I couldn’t help but laugh. It’s big. It’s so big. It’s so big that it’s beyond fear, it’s the kind of big that makes you want to laugh. Elephant? That’s nothing compared to just one of this creature’s hairs. Dinosaur? It’s probably only the size of one of its claws. I’m not kidding, just the dark shape that faintly showed up in the darkness was already the size of a mountain. What if we all got on top of its eye and danced? Would there still be space left?

“Gained, is your magic book alright?”

“I’ve already summoned it.”

“Do you think you can steal that monster’s body?”

The moment those words were said, my breath caught in my throat. Is it possible? Ever since I got the magic book, I’ve never failed to possess someone, unless the opponent was some god-like existence. Grandfather’s annoyed voice came from afar.

“Would it be possible?! If you could steal the body of that thing, you could have stolen the prisoner’s body too. There’s no way it looks like it’s possible, so come over here quickly! Stick to the snow globe!”

“Gained, Ari! Both of you come back to the snow globe!”

Following Hyung and Grandfather’s words, I turned back and thought. The place we thought was a world of extreme cold was actually just the inside of a snow globe. Then, what is that creature? A demon of darkness? A monster that brings about the end of the world? A beast that slaughtered 10 million people?

…It doesn’t seem like it. For some reason, I began to have a hunch about that creature’s identity. If my hunch is right, it’s a very easy matter to steal that creature’s spirit. Ignoring everyone’s desperate calls, I went towards the eye in the darkness. The eye didn’t react to my movement at all. If that creature’s identity is as I expect, it’s not strange. It’s not a creature with a very high intelligence. We probably look like just tiny crawling bugs to it.

My mind floats up. Like a balloon, my mind floats up and flies somewhere, and I sense a sudden change in the monster’s mouth along with that feeling.

— Meow! Meow!

When I regained consciousness, I found myself as a house cat.

“Coco! What was that sound? You didn’t touch Dad’s new snow globe again, did you?”

…

When I heard the voice, probably a teenager, a wicked thought began to stir in the depths of my heart.
