## Chapter 146 – Rest and Reorganization (2)

"Wait! Attention!" Ari shouted loudly in front of us, who were at a loss for what to do about the Hazmat Suit. All eyes turned towards her.  Ari continued, "We can't solve the Hazmat Suit problem by avoiding it. We have to make a decision." 

Eunsol unnie spoke with an ambiguous attitude. "Then, while we eat –"

"No. If we talk about it while eating, we'll just think about it more and end up saying, 'Let's decide later.' Now! Let's decide now." Ari continued, her attitude more resolute than ever before. "Ultimately, the core of the problem related to the Hazmat Suit is who will manage this thing on a regular basis. Because everyone is afraid of the situation where the person in charge puts it on and sneaks out, no one dares to touch it, so it's left here."

Honestly, she was right. Everyone nodded silently. 

"But we absolutely need to use this thing. Everyone knows that it's not just a simple escape tool, right?  Sword-proof, water-proof. These two things alone demonstrate its superhuman performance as a protective suit. Why did the hotel give us this thing?"

I answered. "Because there's a place where we need it."

"Correct! We will definitely use this thing somewhere on the second floor. Maybe we'll have to enter lava, or fight our way through a blizzard of extreme cold. We might have to fight our way through sharp objects that we can't even approach with our bare bodies."

Jincheol-hyung, who had been listening quietly, opened his mouth. "You bringing this up means you're going to manage it, Ari?"

"That's right. The biggest problem with the Hazmat Suit is that the person in charge might sneak out at night. Simply relying on the feeling that this person is trustworthy isn't enough. We need a more reliable reason why they wouldn't escape alone. I already escaped from the hotel once. But I came back because there was someone I needed to save. I believe I have already proven with my actions that I won't leave until I save my mother."

It was a logical argument. Ari was someone who had already escaped but returned because of her purpose. It was clearer than anyone that she wouldn't leave until she achieved her objective.

Song-yi pointed out one thing. "What about after you save your mom? Ah! I don't mean that I suspect you of running away with it! It's just –"

"It's okay. We need to check. That part is not a problem either. Escaping with the Hazmat Suit is a one-person operation, right?  Therefore, nothing will change after I save my mother. Of course, if you want to be suspicious, there's no end to it. In the most extreme case, you could worry that I might only escape with my mother. If you're worried to that extent, let's talk again after the Labyrinth is revived."

Jincheol-hyung asked with a somewhat worried tone. "Do you plan to use it when necessary, too?"

"No. We'll have to decide who's suitable based on the situation. Look at this suit's appearance. It's not something you wear while walking around, is it? It's something you wear when needed, and we'll have the person who needs it at that moment use it. However, let's make it so they have to return it to me after using it."

The room fell silent for a moment. It felt like the criteria for using the Hazmat Suit were set at this point.

1. The person who needs it based on the situation will use it. 
2. Ari will manage it when it's not in use.
3. We'll talk about it again after Ari's mother, the Labyrinth, is revived.

It seemed reasonable. It didn't seem like anyone else was against it either. 

Once the 'trust issue' related to the Hazmat Suit was resolved, the discussion gained momentum rapidly.  Everyone had been brimming with questions about the Hazmat Suit for the past few days.

We all gathered together, even forgoing our meal, and began to test the functions of the Hazmat Suit one by one.

Jincheol-hyung, who had been struggling for a while, took off the Hazmat Suit. 

"This is harder than I thought."

Mookseong grandpa spoke. "What's the matter, you seem slower than usual?"

"It feels like this thing is hindering my movements."

Ari, who was fiddling with the Hazmat Suit's operating system, opened her mouth. "It's subtly similar to the Management Bureau's Enhancement Suit.  This thing weighs over 100 kilograms from the start. It's not something a person moves with physical strength, but rather, it reads the person's movements with a sensor and moves accordingly.  Simply put, the physical strength exerted while wearing the Hazmat Suit is independent of the user's own strength and uses the power of the Hazmat Suit's operating system itself."

I understood what she meant.

"Are you saying that a strong person might become weaker while wearing the Hazmat Suit?"

"It's probably not common in general. Even Seungyeop became quite strong wearing this. Generally speaking, it's right to say that you get stronger wearing the Hazmat Suit. However, there's only one person among us who is 'too' strong for the Enhancement Suit to keep up."

Song-yi chimed in from the side. "I've been wondering since earlier, but the thing that amazes me the most is how it changes size. It fits Seungyeop perfectly when he goes in, and it fits me perfectly when I wear it. When Jincheol oppa put his arm in, it automatically grew bigger. Is it magic?"

Ari offered a slightly different opinion. "It's not this extreme, but the Management Bureau's things do adjust to some extent to the user's body shape.  Considering the weight stays the same regardless of size, it might not be an occult power but rather amazing science..."

It seemed like a pointless discussion. After entering the hotel, amazing science and occult power seemed like the same thing.  What bothered me more was the term 'Management Bureau Enhancement Suit' that had been mentioned repeatedly. Are there such things?

—  Bang! Bang! Two gunshots.

Mookseong grandpa exclaimed in admiration. "Wow! A pistol can't even scratch the surface? It's a pity we couldn't test it with bigger firepower.  What about you, Jincheol, with your strength?"

"I tried punching the wall while wearing it, and I also used the suit's strength itself, but it wouldn't budge at all. However…"

"However?"

"While the suit itself is infinitely strong, the shock does seem to be transferred to the person inside. It reduces quite a bit."

Now was the time for the final test. Song-yi, Jincheol-hyung, and I looked at each other and nodded. Ari was inside the Hazmat Suit. Song-yi went first.

As soon as a white light flashed from her bracelet, Ari inside the suit waved her hands frantically. It was a signal to stop. Defense failure.

Next, I took out the Magic Book. I felt my mind being sucked into the Hazmat Suit before it could even spin.  Since I was in, I pinched Ari's cheek before leaving. Defense failure.

I already had a hunch about this.  But we had to confirm.

We moved the location to the front desk, everyone stood back, and Jincheol-hyung briefly took out the Star. He took it out for a very short moment, but I saw the Hazmat Suit's paint peel off in a flash, and he immediately put it back in.  Surprisingly, as soon as the Star disappeared, the Hazmat Suit's paint slowly restored itself. Defense failure.

With that, the performance test of the Hazmat Suit was concluded, and we could draw some rough conclusions:

1. Everyone except Jincheol-hyung became slightly stronger while wearing the Hazmat Suit.
2. It changes to fit the body shape of whoever wears it.
3. The Hazmat Suit itself is practically invincible, but if it receives a massive shock, the person inside could be in danger.
4. It can't defend against the power of Inheritance.

Finally, Ari put it on and left towards the room.

While everyone was thinking about the functions and usage of the Hazmat Suit, Eunsol unnie spoke with a worried expression.

"If we're going to use it when necessary, do we have to carry that thing around while going through the cursed room?"

"Don't we have to?"

"It's heavier than a person.  I don't know exactly because we don't have a scale, but it's definitely much heavier than Jincheol.  It's over 100 kilograms.  How can we carry that around?"

"We'll have to see how the situation goes, but someone will have to wear it if possible."

"That noisy thing?  All the time?  Who?"

It seemed we needed to decide on someone to wear it during the cursed room, separate from the person who normally stores it (Ari) at the hotel.

At that moment, someone came to mind. Someone who had a useful blessing but whose physical abilities were so lacking that they couldn't properly use it.

As the analysis of the Hazmat Suit ended and the meal was concluding, Gain-i suggested that I use 'The Greedy Hand' once more. When I looked around, Elena, Song-yi, and Jincheol also nodded. It seemed they had already agreed among themselves.  In the end, I decided to use The Greedy Hand.

My companions each gathered near the front desk, preparing for battle in their own way. After looking around, I thought about the 'wish' I needed to make in order to use The Greedy Hand. 

... I often feel that my companions and I are becoming increasingly different.  Making a decision to create an event that could put our lives at risk for the purpose of 'becoming stronger'.  Can this really be considered the mindset of a normal person?

It's a decision only a superhuman being can make, someone who has gained power exceeding that of ordinary humans.

My companions are already superhuman beings who can distort everything with the power of stars, summon scales to crush armies, toy with human senses with a single gesture, borrow the power of angels, or take over people's bodies.

Sometimes, my companions throw jokes at me, jokes that I don't know if they're serious or not.  Jokes like, "Of course, you're from a wealthy family, you don't understand us ordinary people!"  I would have accepted that outside of the hotel. But after entering the hotel, I don't know what to make of it anymore.  What's the point of being rich?  Anyone among them could go outside the hotel and crumble any kind of wealthy family in a day...

I often find it hard to understand. Why do they still listen to me so well? Isn't it a universal truth that when there's a certain level of power difference, even normal conversations become difficult?

To be honest, I also wouldn't even look at people who spoke up at shareholder meetings with only a tiny amount of shares. But seeing my companions listen intently when I speak, I feel both grateful and confused. Sometimes, I wonder what kind of people they are. 

Looking back, Ari's joke about choosing us because we were 'nice' seems to have been a cold, calculated analysis...

... It's weakness. My weakness.  In this hotel where everyone is turning into superhuman beings, I'm still stuck in the human realm, which is why I'm so consumed by weak thoughts.

I looked at The Greedy Hand, hoping to shed this sense of powerlessness.  That butterfly brooch from before.  I haven't even properly used it yet, but that kind of thing isn't enough.  Make me go further.  Help me so I don't get caught up in these weak thoughts again.  Give me the strength so I don't feel inferior when I look at my companions.

‘Choose what you desire. You shall pay a great price.’

/Due to the participant's request, even though it's break time, a surprise event will occur. Surprise Event:  Strange Shop Open!/

A familiar presence appeared. A voice full of bad luck echoed. 

"Ahahahaha!  Oh, my, you're all such excellent customers!  Have you been yearning for my help this much?"
