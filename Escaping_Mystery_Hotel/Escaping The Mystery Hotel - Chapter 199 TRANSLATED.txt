## Chapter 198 – Party Time – Growth, Preparation for the Next Room (2)

When Han Gain summoned the magic book, Ari began to explain slowly. "This book is the source of your supernatural powers. Right?"

"About half. The other half of the source is probably the blessing or tattoo."

"Of course. Anyway, many beings who wield supernatural powers borrow the power of special objects.  We, the hotel participants, are those people, without going far. But, what kind of effect do these objects have on the user? Have you ever thought about that?"

"..."

"Actually, it's not just a story about 'supernatural objects'. It applies to all supernatural experiences. It applies even in situations like 'the dog you raised at home turned out to be a dog from hell'."

Song Yi muttered, slightly surprised. "Pero?"

"There is an organization that is very interested in the effects of supernatural experiences on humans. You know that organization well."

"The Management Bureau."

"Yes. The Management Bureau also has the most supernatural objects. The Management Bureau has been observing for a long time what effects these objects have on their users. And they have found some distinct changes."

As I listened to the content, it wasn't just a story about me. Song Yi, the owner of the bracelet, and Jin Chul Hyung, the owner of the star, also approached Ari with an interested look.

"Supernatural object users, even if they were ordinary people at first, gradually begin to change over time. How those changes manifest is literally case by case. Some suddenly sprout horns, some start seeing things they couldn't see before, and some start suffering from mental illness."

"Are there times when the change is good and times when it's bad?"

"You could say that. The Management Bureau calls those changes in a general way, 'the soul level has risen'."

"Just hearing the expression itself doesn't make sense. Why does 'soul' suddenly come out?"

"That's a good point. The reason why the expression doesn't make sense is because we didn't create this expression ourselves. It is knowledge passed down from beings close to the unreal world, such as demons or monsters, who can communicate. They called people who had experienced 'change' 'their souls have risen in level'."

Song Yi couldn't bear it anymore and asked. "What does 'soul' mean? What exactly does it mean that it has risen in level?"

The answer was rather disappointing.

"I don't know."

"Huh?"

"I really don't know. I've said it many times, but most members of the Management Bureau are just ordinary humans born and raised on Earth. Of course, smarter and mentally tougher people gather at the Management Bureau than ordinary people, but even then, they are ultimately human, aren't they? Even if demons say something about human souls, they don't even understand what that soul is. It doesn't even appear or get caught."

Grandpa interjected slightly. "I don't know the true meaning of the phrase 'the soul has risen in level'. But I vaguely know what changes happen when such a phenomenon occurs. For example, the most typical phenomenon is what's called 'inspiration'."

"Inspiration?"

"It's the phenomena Ari mentioned earlier. Things that were not visible suddenly become visible, or words that were not audible suddenly become audible, isn't that right?"

Jin Chul Hyung, who had been listening quietly for a while, asked. "What changes have you two experienced? Grandpa?"

Grandpa's expression momentarily stiffened. Ari answered instead.

"Mook Sung removed the change through surgery."

"Cough! You, you experienced physical changes. What about Ari?"

Ari suddenly fell into thought, then answered in an ambiguous tone. "I think I do. The change has definitely happened, but I can't specifically name exactly what change."

Jin Chul Hyung showed a confused reaction. "What are you talking about?"

I vaguely understood Ari's words. "It's because your body has become one with the 'Ancient Blood', right?"

"That's right. Don't you ever think about it when you see my power? How come this guy uses all sorts of colorful powers with just one legacy? Like that."

As soon as those words came out, everyone's heads nodded in unison, including me! It's a thought we've had dozens of times. In a way, the Ancient Blood is too different from all of our legacies. How many superpowers has Ari shown with just that one legacy? Basic things like hypnosis, flight, and enhanced strength, and she's also filled the blood with healing power or even stored her own memories in it. To exaggerate a little, the legacy, the Ancient Blood, is a versatile performance that can do anything, no matter what ability she uses.  Among the treasures we have gained, nothing can cause as many phenomena as the Ancient Blood.  We understood part of that secret through today's conversation.

"I have gained all sorts of strange experiences for a long time and used the Ancient Blood. I've heard from demons and monsters that your soul has risen in level dozens of times. And..."

"And?"

"Over time, I've been able to do more and more. One day I was suddenly able to fly, and another day I was suddenly able to break stones with my bare hands. The problem is that I can't tell what is my power due to the change of my soul and what is new power developed because I'm getting more skilled in using the Ancient Blood."

It's a simple story. For Ari, who was one with her legacy from birth, the Ancient Blood was already something indistinguishable from herself.  It means that she can't distinguish between the power that arose from the rise of her soul level and the power she newly developed as she became more skilled in using her legacy.

While everyone was asking Ari various questions, I started to focus on myself again. Did I also start to develop special powers?  That's possible. A few unusual experiences I had in the Christmas, the Hell of Maze, crossed my mind. However, at least what the Owl instructed me was not to find new superpowers or anything like that.  Study again. Studying is what you do by reading books, so ultimately it's saying to open the magic book again! Stroking the magic book, I decided to look at the latter part of the magic book, 'The Power of Transformation', again sometime tonight when I was alone.

After the morning conversation, we naturally left room 105 and headed for the elevator. What changes had happened on the second floor?

"*Wow! It's so luxurious!*"

"*My eyes just disappeared. There's a ceiling now.*"

"*Is that a chandelier? Is that a Christmas tree?*"

The repaired second floor was truly the epitome of luxury of a 5-star hotel.  All around were gleaming decorations and beautiful paintings, and the spaces that were just walls had all changed into separate rooms.  Especially the Christmas tree in the middle of the huge hall in the center was a sight to behold. It was so spectacular that everyone's feet didn't easily move from in front of it! 

After looking around for a while, we discovered a few mysterious features and new changes on the second floor.

Firstly, there were many rooms without numbers. All the empty rooms on the first floor had numbers from 101 to 107, and had roles such as the Curse Room, the Rest Room, the Mission Room, and the Gate Room.  On the other hand, among the rooms on the second floor, there were quite a few that didn't have numbers.  Of course, rooms with names from 201 to 207 also appeared.  It seemed that the second floor was more than twice the size of the first floor due to these new rooms or the huge hall in the center.

Secondly, a formal entrance leading out of the second floor appeared. Of course, since we can no longer go outside the snow globe to the outside world, it is a door that leads to the snowfield outside the second floor. Now we don't need to break down the wall every time we go out to the snowfield.

Thirdly, the 'Mysterious Artisan' we discovered in the outside world and the unidentified 'package' were placed on the second floor. Also, it's ambiguous to call it a feature of the second floor, but Ari's blessing 'Secret' was reactivated.

"Come here, everyone! My blessing started working again as soon as we got to the second floor!"

"Oh! Secret?"

"Yes. I'll tell you the information that just appeared. There are 2 hidden NPCs and 2 hidden rooms on the second floor."

"Did we already find one NPC and one room?"

"That's right. We found the Mysterious Artisan and the Resurrection Room. The 'Mirror Room' is also named, so it's showing up in the blessing."

As Ari spoke, she wrote on the white board installed in the corner on the right of the center of the second floor.

Hidden NPC 1. Mysterious Artisan: Waking up.
2. ???
Hidden Room 1. Resurrection Room (!)
2. Mirror Room (?)

"Waking up? And what's the ! and ? mark next to the room?"

"I just wrote what I see. Maybe this Lego will wake up from his sleep in a few days and talk to us? ! means the explanation of the Resurrection Room comes out if you focus on that mark. It's already a story everyone knows. ? means that we haven't found the room yet."

"You said your blessing is to find out the secrets of the hotel? Can you feel where it is?"

"It's not like I just stand still and know automatically, it's more like I get a vague idea of the location as I walk around. By the way, the door to the Resurrection Room appeared on the left side of the Christmas tree."

"It seems like we need to search for the Mirror Room and another NPC as well."

My sister interjected slightly. "Let's do that search later. As you can see, everyone's in a bad shape."

"Yes. It's just that we'll do it someday. The rest day is over tomorrow anyway, so let's stop searching."

We were all tired from looking around the outside world, and those who had been drained by the Scent of Rest still had a pale look. We only have two days left before we have to enter the Curse Room.  It's time to recover our strength rather than start something new.

In the middle of our conversation, a notification suddenly popped up in front of everyone.

"Whoa! What's that?"

"Ah, I'm sorry everyone. This notification suddenly popped up when I was trying to open this package."

The third achievement we discovered in the outside world. Thinking about it now, the object hidden under the snow globe, a place that was absurd, was none other than a package. Of course, the real identity can't be a package, it's something inside, right?  Anyway, what's with this [In Transit]? Does that even make sense?

Elena, who soon had the same thought as me, spoke. "Isn't it ridiculous? I mean, if it's in transit, then the package itself shouldn't have arrived, right? The package is already here, but they kept it from being opened and said it's 'In Transit'. What's that? It's so careless!"

Ari chuckled. "Isn't it the hotel's way of being funny! I found it kind of funny."

It seems that the old beings' sense of humor does have some common ground.  I didn't bother to point it out.

"Maybe it will open when the rest day ends?  Let's just wait a little longer. The Golden Egg also took quite a while to hatch before."

...With my last words, silence fell upon the hotel. I had a lot of things to do individually, like researching the magic book again, and Elena has to practice more ominous imaginations that she's not yet proficient in, but there's almost nothing left to do together.  Normally, the most important things to do during party time are to decide which room to go to next and to explore, but this time we don't need either. We decided to stop exploring because it's hard, and we already decided to go to room 104 next.  There's only one thing left to decide in the meeting. Should we use the 'Resurrection' ticket this time? And if we do, who should we use it on?

We naturally dispersed to spend our own time and went out to the snowfield on the second floor, thinking about researching the magic book by myself until lunch time.

—  *Thud!*

"Ah!  Miry! You really do that again – It can't be Miry. Eun Sol, Unnie?"

"Sorry!  I was far away so I couldn't hear you. Anyway, did the Hell of Maze throw a snowball at you?"

"Hahaha! It did."

Remembering the memory of a snowball fight with Miry, I couldn't help but laugh. Isn't it one of the most fun times I've had in this horrible hotel?  I wonder if I'm strange or the hotel is strange to think that the most fun time I had was spent in 'Hell', not just any other place.

"Hmm..."  Unnie approached me with a meaningful expression on her face. "So, how was Miry?"

"...Did you ask anyone else?"

"I didn't ask and I don't plan to ask. Does it make any sense to ask your daughter and your coworker?  Of course, let's get one thing straight. I have no intention of saving someone who's not in their right mind. But if a method to make Miry come to her senses is found in the future, I'll ask if she's someone worth reviving. You'll forget this in time, so let's talk about it before that happens."

I walked around the snowfield and reflected on my experiences in the Hell of Maze.
