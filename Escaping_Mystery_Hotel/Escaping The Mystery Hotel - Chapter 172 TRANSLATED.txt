## Chapter 171 – Time of Choice, Choice of Reward – Han Gain

Han Gain was surprised to learn she could choose her reward, but the next part was even more shocking. The only people eligible to receive the inheritance were those who survived until the room was solved and had accumulated enough contribution points. Contribution points were important, but surviving was key. Yet, even with the Eye of the Zeroth Dimension covering the world, someone had survived. Soon, a notification appeared, answering my question.

*  "Participants! Congratulations on the successful resolution of Room 201! Participants who have survived and contributed to the final showdown are eligible for the inheritance. The eligible participants are:
1. Elena Ivanova (Justice)
2. Han Gain (Wisdom)
However, only one person can receive the inheritance! The ‘Time of Choice’ will begin soon!"*

Elena was alive! Her survival itself was surprising, but it made sense from a contribution perspective. After the first attempt, the biggest obstacle in both the second and third attempts was Beatrice's power. Elena was the one who fought most fiercely against Beatrice every time. It was a shame that Eun Sol, who gathered all the information by herself in the second attempt, didn't get chosen. Perhaps she died the moment the Eye of the Zeroth Dimension was broken? ... It's a pity, but I've already experienced it. The Time of Choice, what did Jin Cheol say about it? He said that when you regain consciousness, you'll be thrown into an arena-like space to fight, right? Of course, I don't even want to fight, and it's already decided who will get the reward – a dizzying sensation made me lose consciousness momentarily.

* When I regained consciousness, I wasn't in a Colosseum, at least. It was a normal hotel room, with a table, a bed, and a display. I turned my head towards the bed. "Ugh!" Elena was lying on the bed, seemingly fainted. Her clothes were in disarray, almost half naked, but I couldn't think about anything inappropriate since her body was covered in blood. ... Surprisingly, it didn't seem to be Elena's blood. I gently wiped it off with the blanket, and despite the torn clothes, she didn't seem to have suffered any serious injuries. She was breathing evenly. Had she just fallen asleep due to exhaustion? After a while, Elena woke up. She seemed somewhat confused by her situation, but after drinking a glass of water beside her, she calmly explained what she had experienced. Elena had been fighting fiercely against Beatrice, her power of Justice almost exhausted. She thought she was going to die and gave up. At that moment, Beatrice suddenly flew away. Perhaps she sensed my revival and rushed to stop me. While chasing Beatrice immediately, Elena's power of Justice completely depleted. She could no longer fly and fell to the ground, fainting, and this is where she regained consciousness.
"It's a good thing I fainted. I definitely would have died if I was conscious."
"Yes?"
"Nothing." I also briefly summarized what I had experienced. Elena's eyes widened when I mentioned the head researcher waking up inside me at the moment the seal was broken. ... This was the first time we had a conversation just the two of us since leaving the gateway room. The conversation felt awkward, and I hoped the hotel would proceed quickly. Sensing our readiness, the display in the room flickered and gave an announcement.
* "Please decide which reward you will receive and which of you will receive it."*

Who should receive it was already a settled matter. I said it frankly to the surprised Elena. "Elena should receive the inheritance this time."
"... You don't have to give it up to me..."
"I've already been sealed once. Receiving the inheritance here would just lead to me being sealed again throughout the second floor. As I will explain later, I've also learned quite a bit about the sealing system. There was no mention that someone who has been sealed once cannot be sealed again. I could be sealed again."
"I see..."
"But it's interesting that you can choose the reward itself. One seems to be a 'scalene polyhedron', but what's the other one?"

The display flickered again, as if waiting.

* "Choose your reward!
1. Inheritance, 'Shining Scalene Polyhedron'
2. Ability, 'Ominous Imagination'"*

One was something I already suspected. The strange tool the head researcher used to create cubes, 'Shining Scalene Polyhedron'. The other was somewhat unexpected. It was labeled as an ability, not an inheritance, and it wasn't a physical object. It was Beatrice's superpower, 'Ominous Imagination'. This was the second option offered by the hotel.
"Hey, Gain?"
"Yes?"
"You said you briefly became one with the head researcher, right?"
"Yes, but there's no need to worry, he's separate now."
"Do you still have the head researcher's memories?"
"When we merged, it wasn't like all the knowledge the head researcher accumulated throughout his life entered my mind. It was like when I use my possession ability. Only the information needed to solve the room entered my mind. I still have that information."
"Can you explain it a bit?"

It was true. Unlike Elena, who knew nothing about the Scalene Polyhedron and Ominous Imagination, I had some knowledge of both. Neither the inheritance nor the ability was something easy to use. I started explaining everything that came to mind.
"Ominous Imagination. Based on the information I reviewed, it's not simply a power that creates monsters. Creating monsters is a more advanced use of it. It's basically a power that turns your ominous imaginations into reality."
"Turning ominous imaginations into reality?"
"I don't have any specific examples, so it's hard to explain further."
"I see."
"However, there's a slight…"
"A slight?"
"Slight risk of the ability causing mental illness to the user. It's that kind of superpower."
"... What about the Scalene Polyhedron?"
"The Scalene Polyhedron, this is the tool the head researcher used to create 'Cubes'. It's a tool that can twist space in various ways. You can create a subspace with it, or set up invisible walls. You can also create transparent boxes that no one can enter, or use it for a form of 'Teleport'. It's a very extraordinary inheritance with endless possibilities."

Elena's eyes sparkled at that! To be honest, she looked so beautiful that I couldn't meet her gaze for a moment.
"That would be great! It's better than a superpower that can easily drive you crazy!"
"There is… one serious problem with the Scalene Polyhedron as well."
"What is it?"
"According to the head researcher's assessment, you need to be able to perform mathematical calculations every second while using it. It's a tool that requires a high level of intellect."
"..."
"The head researcher thinks that most people wouldn't be able to even create a proper wall with it. For reference, he believes he is the most intelligent person on Earth."

The hotel room fell silent. I was speechless after saying that. An ability that's easy to use but could easily drive you crazy, and an inheritance that only geniuses on Earth could use even 1% of its potential. What kind of rewards are these? ... Elena looked at me.
"Just pick for me, Gain."

To entrust such a burdensome decision to me...
"I can only offer a recommendation. In my opinion, the side effects of 'Ominous Imagination' are manageable considering the nature of the hotel. It's not the difficulty of using the ability that's the problem, but the side effects that could arise during its use, right? But if you need to use the ability, it's usually in a cursed room. If you go crazy while using the ability in a cursed room..."
"You'd recover once you go outside."
"That's right. So, it's a risky ability but manageable. However, the Scalene Polyhedron..."
"It's basically useless if I don't suddenly become a genius?"
"I'm sorry."
"Because I'm not as smart as those people at the top of the Management Bureau. I haven't been that good at studying either."

Seeing her reaction, Elena seemed to have realized what she should choose. Elena needed to get Ominous Imagination. At the very least, she needed to obtain an ability she could use normally, right?
Elena stood up and went towards the display –
"Ugh!"

She was almost half-naked with her clothes torn, covering herself with a blanket, and she suddenly got up! Shocked, I turned around, and I heard a giggle from behind. I turned back, and Elena had put on the inner blanket like a gown over the outer blanket while I was talking to her. I was stunned, feeling like an idiot. While I was in a daze, Elena manipulated the display several times.
"I've chosen."

With those words, the room we were in began to crumble. The long ordeal of Room 201 had finally ended.

* Date: 87th Day
Current Location: Floor 2, Corridor
Sage's Advice: 0*
– Han Gain —

*Whiz! Whoosh! "Ach!"*

A sharp wind hit me as soon as I stepped out of Room 201, feeling like my skin would be ripped off! From a distance, Jin Cheol was looking at me and shouting something.
"Mmmm! Mmmm?"
"Yes?"

The old man next to him also shouted something.
"Mmmm!"
"Yes?"

What are they saying? The blizzard was so intense that I couldn't understand what anyone was saying. The chat window flickered.

Kim Mook Seong: Are you awake?
Han Gain: Yes. Elena obtained the inheritance.
Lee Eun Sol: Congratulations!
Kim Ah Ri: Congrats!
Yoo Song Yi: Congrats!
Elena: Thank you.
Cha Jin Cheol: Congratulations!
Park Seung Yeop: Congrats! Let's go first.

As soon as he said that, we all ran towards the elevator. Although it was a solved room, everyone seemed to have many questions about Room 201. It's true that apart from me, no one truly understood what happened in Room 201. Most people died or lost consciousness shortly after the Eye of the Zeroth Dimension was broken. I felt the need to explain the bizarre events that occurred in Room 201 while enjoying dinner tonight.

Elena, who had been running beside me, suddenly stopped.
"Elena? The blizzard is strong, you'll be in trouble if you fall behind –"
"This is the ability."
"Yes?"

Elena looked back at me with a dazed expression.
"I think I understand. They said that you automatically learn how to use an inheritance when you get it. I guess it's the same with superpowers."
"Let's go to the elevator first? We can talk about it while eating in the first –"
"I'm sorry, I already used it. Unintentionally."
"Yes?" —

*Wooowoo! Wooowoo!*

A harsh blizzard with a visibility of less than 10 meters, a freezing cold location where you can't even tell where you are. A wolf's howl echoes from somewhere invisible. Elena, with a vacant expression, muttered.
"This might sound strange, but my mother always told me when it snowed. On winter nights, there are always wolves outside the house, so –"
"Elena! Stop! Stop!"

I covered Elena's mouth with my hand. Really! I now understand what kind of ability 'Ominous Imagination' is. I recommended it, so what can I say? It seems like I'll be quite busy throughout the party time until Elena becomes proficient with this ability.
