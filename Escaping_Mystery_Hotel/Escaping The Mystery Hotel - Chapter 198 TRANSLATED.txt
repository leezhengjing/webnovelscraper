## Chapter 197 – Party Time – Growth, Preparations for the Next Room (1)

‘Remember what I’m about to say, don’t miss a single word.’  The tension in the air was so thick it felt like it was choking me. I focused all my attention.

“Firstly, this matter transcends the limits of wisdom. I won’t be able to offer any advice in the Curse Room you enter next. Punishment begins today. Secondly, the penalty for a specific room is determined the moment you first enter. Choose your rooms wisely. Thirdly,”…

The Owl fell silent after saying ‘thirdly’.  Its beak kept clicking in front of me, but no sound came out. If it were a human, I would have at least attempted to read their lip movements. Even the best lip-reader couldn’t decipher the movements of a beak.

Since the Owl fell silent, I looked around for a moment.  A plain, white room. I must have fallen asleep in Room 105 after a long search, feeling drained. Perhaps this was a dream.

The Owl's expression changed. I could sense the meaning of that expression. It was ‘frustration’.  An unknown force seemed to be preventing the Owl from communicating. Perhaps the force that caged the Owl in its cage decided the third thing it was trying to tell me crossed a line. Or maybe it was granted permission to convey the content of the penalty after being penalized. The first two things seemed to be related to ‘what the penalty is and how it’s applied’. 

What was the third thing?

—Thud!

Suddenly, a sound echoed again.

“Thirdly, I feel your growth.  It’s good to study again.”

Clang!

The moment those words were spoken, an unknown sound rang out, and my consciousness drifted away.  Until my consciousness faded, I kept replaying those three words in my head.  I needed to analyze their meaning as soon as I woke up.

*Date: Day 95
Current Location: 1st Floor, Room 105 – Rest Room
Sage’s Advice: X*

As soon as my mind vaguely woke up, I checked the Status Window. ... The spot where the Sage’s Advice counter was displayed now showed an ‘X’.  I had never seen that before.  This must be the ‘penalty’. Did the other functions disappear too? If the Filter function or Scenario Comprehension were gone, that would be a serious problem.

The Status Window, as I imagined, extended and covered my surroundings. Judging from the situation, the Filter function seemed to be intact, but I still needed to confirm if the mental defense function was working. There was no way to know if Scenario Comprehension was functioning right now. 

On the second day of my three-day break, initiated by using my Rest Ticket, the contents of the morning meeting were decided.

*As breakfast time approached, the people I missed all returned. My companions, who had their energy drained by the Ancestral Incense, still looked pale, but they seemed to have regained enough strength to converse with smiles. As if recounting heroic tales, Ari, Grandpa, Jincheol, and I all shared the story of how we broke through the 2nd floor exterior wall, discovered the Snow Globe, and then explored the outside world. Everyone listened intently with excitement. 

As the heroic tale came to an end, Elena asked with a worried tone: “Hearing that the entire 2nd floor is inside the Snow Globe makes me curious. What if the people outside dispose of or destroy the Snow Globe?” 

Ari replied nonchalantly, “I don’t know. However, let’s think back to the hotel style we've experienced. The hotel style doesn’t involve ending things in a way that completely annihilates us inside without any countermeasures.”

“That’s true,” I added. “It’s still possible, but I think the connection to the outside world is permanently severed. Jincheol confirmed yesterday that we can’t go outside anymore.”

“If we can’t go out, the outside world can’t influence the inside of the Snow Globe either?”

“I think so.”  My sister spoke up, “I think the same thing about that. But I’m curious about something else.  Where are that ‘Artisan’ and the ‘shining dust’?”

“Maybe they will be at the reception-like place after we eat. Or maybe they’ll be on the 2nd floor. It’s supposed to be fixed today.”

“Is that so? Let’s go after we eat. I’m looking forward to the 2nd floor. Grandpa said we worked so hard to find it, so they shouldn’t take it from us. Anyway, as you all know, we have a lot to decide–”

“Hold on! I know what you’re about to say, but there’s something we need to confirm first.” 

I hurriedly stopped my sister from changing the subject and relayed the content I received from the Owl last night, writing the Owl’s three pronouncements on the whiteboard in front of me without missing a single word.

*Firstly, this matter transcends the limits of wisdom. I won’t be able to offer any advice in the Curse Room you enter next. Punishment begins today.
Secondly, the penalty for a specific room is determined the moment you first enter. Choose your rooms wisely.
Thirdly, I feel your growth. It’s good to study again.*

Silence hung in the air for a moment before Ari cautiously offered her opinion.

“The meaning of the first statement seems to be exactly what it looks like.  The Owl told us about something before we realized it related to exploring the 2nd floor. Maybe that was the problem.”

“Right.  Maybe because it gave us advice about something we didn’t ask or realize, we got a penalty. The subsequent sentence is clear. The number X already appears next to Advice.  It means we can’t use advice today and tomorrow, and we also can’t get advice in the next Curse Room we enter.”

My sister sighed, “Isn’t that penalty too harsh? The Advice function is essentially more than half of your blessing. It’s not a big deal that we can’t use it for a few days, but being blocked in the next Curse Room is a fatal blow.” 

Grandpa, who had been staring at the whiteboard for a long time, offered his opinion. “This feels like the Advice will be blocked only for the first attempt in the next Curse Room, doesn’t it?”

“I think so too. If it were just the first attempt, it would have said ‘first attempt’.”

“It means we have to clear one Curse Room without your advice, and here comes the second announcement.”

The first announcement means that I won’t be able to use advice during this break and in the next Curse Room.  Does that mean ‘which’ Curse Room will block my advice? The answer lies in the second announcement. It says that it’s determined the moment you first enter the next Curse Room.  In other words, if I enter Room 202 for the first time,  ‘advice can’t be used in Room 202’ is determined immediately.  Even if I escape and move on to Room 203, Room 203 won’t have the penalty applied.

Ari, who had understood the content so far, answered. “Let’s definitely consider that when deciding which room to enter next.  Actually, I think the answer is clear already. It’s Room 104, isn’t it?”

“Huh? What are you talking about?” Songi, who didn’t understand what Ari meant, asked.

I briefly explained to Songi. “We can’t get my advice in the next room, right? I’m a bit uneasy about challenging the unknown rooms on the 2nd floor without knowing anything.”

“Ah!  So, should we go to Room 104 as you and Ari said? Come to think of it, Room 104 has a clue, right? It was ‘ㅁ is the way to ㅁㅁ your father’.”

Ari replied, “You remember that? You have a good memory. You’re right. We’ll talk about this again later, but we should probably go to Room 104.  It’s a bit too much to enter a completely unknown room on the 2nd floor without the help of advice.  Actually, I thought of a tactic.”

I could instantly guess what tactic she meant.

“Is the tactic to enter Room 104 once and if there’s no answer, escape somehow and progress through the rooms on the 2nd floor?”

“Yeah. We also have the escape button to escape in case we don’t like it.  After we escape somehow, we can just forget about Room 104 where we can’t use advice. Like I said, we don’t have to solve every room.”

Ari has always treated Room 104 as a ‘failed room’. She seems to think that due to gaining the power of a ‘Descendant’ - a power that could even surpass an inheritance in a way - it became a room that couldn’t be solved normally.  The new penalty is also ruining one of the Curse Rooms by blocking the use of advice.

Thinking that far, I understood Ari’s ‘true thoughts’ - why she suddenly advocated for re-entering Room 104, a room she had been reluctant to enter until now. 

Let’s just throw the advice penalty on top of Room 104, which is already a failed room, and concentrate all the failed elements in that one room and give up!…

I still have some break time left, so let’s think a little more. At least it’s not a baseless judgment.

Grandpa, who had been silent, spoke up, “I feel your growth. It’s good to study again.  What does this sound like? This place is not a good place to study.”

“I’ll explain the circumstances surrounding this statement.  The Owl was about to say something when an unknown force prevented its voice from being heard.  The Owl fell silent for a moment before suddenly saying those words and ending the conversation.”

My sister muttered, “It sounds like it’s saying something ‘indirectly’.” 

Silence descended again. Grandpa spoke once more. “Let’s break it down. ‘I feel your growth.’ It’s praise, but I don’t think they would say this just to give praise.”

“Right. We already received praise before…”

“‘What’ kind of growth? Actually, I have a faint feeling about this.”

“Yes?” 

As I looked up, wondering what he meant, Ari, who had heard Grandpa's words, had a look of understanding on her face.

“Gaein, have you ever heard of the term ‘Soul Level’?”

“Yes?”

Ari murmured softly. “‘Study’ means learning from books, right?  Take out your magic book.”
