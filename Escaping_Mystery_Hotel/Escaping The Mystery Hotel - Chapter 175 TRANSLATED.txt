## Chapter 174 – Party Time – Elena’s Worries (1)

Everyone’s expressions turned serious as they carefully read the Han Gain notification. The top part was just the usual congratulatory message and party time announcement, but the real important content was in the “Additional Notice.”

“Check the ticket? You mean the rewards for the Gate room? Where is the ticket right now?” 

My sister immediately ran to get the ticket. A faint glow emanated from it. As soon as the ticket arrived, another small notification popped up:

/You had to give up one treasure among the different ones! Isn’t it regrettable? Don’t worry! You can get the missed reward by using the ticket in the Mirror room./

This notification confirmed our suspicions. What was the meaning of having a separate “Mirror room” for missed rewards? This wasn’t unique to Room 201! In other rooms on the second floor, we could choose one out of two rewards, and the missed reward could be obtained with a ticket. This added credence to Ari’s guess that there were more ways to obtain tickets. 

With so many uses and a dedicated room for them, this single ticket couldn’t be the end!

“The missed reward is referring to the irregular polyhedron, right?” My sister asked with wide eyes.

“That’s the meaning, I guess? You can get the missed reward by using the ticket in a place called the ‘Mirror Room.’ Where is the Mirror Room? Ari?”

Ari’s blessing, “Secret,” was specialized in uncovering “secrets of the hotel” in addition to keeping her own secrets.

“Just a second.” Ari seemed to be concentrating for a while, then she shook her head. “I can’t find anything.”

“Huh?”

“It says there’s nothing. Usually, it shows a few hidden NPCs and hidden rooms. For example, the NPCs on the first floor were the merchant and the doctor, and the rooms were the Sanctuary of Blessings and the souvenir shop.”

Ari walked to the whiteboard and wrote:

‘Real Real’ Secret Information (2nd Floor)
Hidden NPCs: -/?
Hidden Rooms: -/?
Location Information: ?
Function Description: ?

“This is the kind of image I have in my head, but as you can see, the main details are all question marks. Before finding a room or NPC, it usually gives hints, but even those aren’t appearing.”

It was a given, but wasn’t it because of this blessing that Ari had found the Sanctuary of Blessings faster than anyone else in the past? And wasn’t it because of this blessing that Grandpa had suddenly taken us to the “Climbing” room and then found the souvenir shop?

“Is it possible that there’s nothing at all? According to the ticket notification, there’s a place called the ‘Mirror Room’?”

It dawned on me as I listened to Eun Sol and Ari’s conversation.

“Perhaps it needs to be activated after the ‘Hotel Repair’ is complete.”

We were back to square one. All the notifications about the hotel were focused on the “Hotel Repair” to fix the messed-up second floor. 

Jin Cheol sighed deeply.

“Honestly, what kind of hotel is this? If the facilities are messed up, shouldn’t they refund the money, apologize, and send the guests home?”

In the quiet atmosphere, Seung Yeop finally spoke in a tired voice.

“Anyway, the party time starts tomorrow, right? How about we discuss this tomorrow?”

We had just come out of Room 201, and after having a long, head-scratching discussion during dinner, I was genuinely tired.

Just before we disbanded, my sister mentioned tomorrow’s schedule.

“Get some rest! Meet up in the morning as soon as we wake up! Let’s go to the Sanctuary of Blessings first. We need to strengthen our blessings before the party time starts.”

We should also think about where to use the advice tomorrow. 

Ari suddenly asked a question.

“Elena said she would take a nap first, right? Does that mean she’s alone in the bedroom?”

“Probably? Guys! Be careful. It’s still a few minutes until dinner time, so if you go to the bedroom, Elena will be there.”

“Yes.”

“Han Gain.”

“Hmm?”

Ari suddenly called me.

* — Cackle! … So noisy. — Creak! Creak! … Should I check? I shouldn’t, though. Every time I check, the situation only gets worse. … “Kyaa!” — Bang!  I couldn’t take it anymore and opened my eyes a little. The moment I did, I was shocked and stumbled back, bumping into the wall. No matter how you look at it, what is this thing under the blanket? I thought the cuckoo clock sounded strangely vivid, but it was actually a living cuckoo with a sawtooth beak that popped out! The mountain and waterfall painted in the frame on the wall were strangely twisted, and the waterfall was turning red. I don’t think there was ever a doll on the table, but now a mysterious clown doll is staring at me intently. And a little while ago, when I couldn’t stand the noise anymore and opened my eyes, a hand popped out from under the blanket! My stress shot up to the sky, and I felt like I was going crazy. The bedroom door opened. “Don’t, don’t come in! It’s dangerous –” — Swoosh! The clown, with blood dripping from its mouth, turned around while spitting out something sharp. A translucent blade sliced through the air and instantly tore the clown doll to shreds. “What danger? It’s nothing.” … Ari chuckled as if wondering what was going on, and soon she took down the picture frame and snapped the neck of the living cuckoo. “Were you having so much fun by yourself?” “Ari…” Ari jumped onto the bed, and a hand suddenly popped out. “What’s this?” Ari pulled the hand from under the blanket, and it disappeared like dust. “Looks like you haven’t slept at all.” “…” “Ah, this is the first time I’ve seen such a fun ability. It would have been super fun if I had gotten it!” … This kid is really different from me. I knew that before, but I’ve never felt it as strongly as I do now. How can she laugh off these monsters? Even I, the one who created them, can barely handle the fear! Seeing Ari’s nonchalant attitude, I felt my own heart slowly calming down. Ari checked the time. “Dinner will be over in about two minutes. We’ll be separated into our own spaces.” “That’s right.” “Hey, let’s sleep together on the sofa near the dessert table on the first floor tonight.” “Ari?” “You won’t be able to get any sleep like this. Am I wrong?” I couldn’t refuse. Ari grabbed my hand and pulled me out of Room 105. * – Han Gain

From a distance, I watched as Ari pulled Elena out of Room 105. As Ari had predicted, Elena hadn’t slept at all. It wouldn’t have been easy to sleep peacefully while constantly creating monsters around her. I moved closer to them as naturally as possible. Being together, these two really felt like they were emitting light. If I had met them in the real world, wouldn’t even eye contact feel oppressive? “Elena! How many times have you used your ability?” “… I didn’t use it, it was involuntary.” “Wow, I’m curious. You know, I saw it earlier, and it was a really fun ability! Creating a wolf with your eyes? Isn’t that amazing? It was so cute!” “Honestly, it didn’t look cute to me…” — Thump! Ari kicked my thigh and subtly signaled me to join in! This kid has been asking a lot from me since earlier. We sat near the dessert table and started chatting about our daily lives before entering the hotel. “When did you start dreaming of becoming an actress, Elena?” “Since I was little! I traveled all over the world with my parents, so I didn’t have many friends…. Watching plays or movies occasionally was my only joy. And I, um, felt like I could be an actress.” Even I would feel like I should try being an actress or an entertainer if I was born like Elena. Ari chimed in. “Isn’t it about time you two start talking casually? It feels like you two are still the most awkward in our party when speaking.” As Ari, the ultimate destroyer of family lineage, the one who talks casually to everyone and gets talked back to by everyone, suggested we talk casually, it carried a lot of weight. “Heh heh…. I think we need a bit more time.” “Gain, try saying ‘Elena Noona’ right now.” “… Elena Noona?” “Don’t do that.” “It’s best not to.” Why did you even ask then? The topic of our chat naturally shifted to me. “So, Han Gain-ssi, did your grades start coming up in your second year of high school?” “Hahaha! Yes. You see, I was actually -” “Gain, tell us something interesting. Do you really have nothing to say besides high school study stories?” “…” “Oh, I was listening with great interest. Hearing about high school reminds me of my childhood…” This is ominous! Ominous! Elena’s ‘childhood.’ Isn’t this off-limits? Similar topics include Ari’s ‘age,’ Jin Cheol’s ‘dreams,’ and Seung Yeop’s ‘LoL tier.’ Ari’s expression darkened momentarily. “Back then, I couldn’t even drink tea comfortably, afraid it might be poisoned.” Purple bubbles started rising from Elena’s teacup. “I was always worried if someone was following me while walking.” Something started wriggling from everyone’s shadows. Ari’s expression was about to turn pale, but I made a decision. “This tea must be a warm Hongcha infused with the love of Elena’s homeland.” I snatched Elena’s teacup and poured it onto the shadows. — Sizzle! Gurgle! A strange noise and smell spread from the floor, like they had poured acid on it. “…” “…” “…” Ari finally laughed belatedly. “Ahahaha! Elena, you really have the power to make your daily life fun! To think you can make a simple act of drinking tea into something so tense, no, so exciting!” “I’m sorry….” “No, Elena, it’s really fun. This is the first time I’ve found drinking coffee so enjoyable.” The dessert time ended in an awkward atmosphere. As I sighed and returned to my room, I recalled the conversation I had with Ari earlier. “Elena’s ability, isn’t it fun?” “What are you talking about? That’s the most terrifying ability I’ve ever seen.” “Never say that word ‘terrifying’ out loud again. Fear is contagious. From now on, think of it as fun. Just believe it’s fun. Until Elena believes it too.” “…” … It looks like I’ll have a very fun daily life for a while. I recalled the memories of the Head Researcher. What kind of training did Beatrice do to help her control that power? Next Chapter
