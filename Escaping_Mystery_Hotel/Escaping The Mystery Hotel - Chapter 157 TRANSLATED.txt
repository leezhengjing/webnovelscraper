## Chapter 156 – Room 201, Cursed Room – ‘□ □□’ –

Yusong’s eyes widened in shock as she heard the sound of shattering glass. She turned towards the sink, but it was already too late. The mirror had broken, and a monstrous girl had burst out! Her hair was a mess, and her eyes, only whites, were pulsating in a horrifying way. The girl killed Ari in one swift move, picked up Ari’s head, and approached them. 

“I let her live because she was pretty~! But you’re going to play with me for a long time.” Before she could finish, Grandpa and Eunsol were frantically pulling the triggers of their guns! The girl nonchalantly received the barrage of bullets as if she were enjoying a refreshing shower. The bullets didn’t even pierce her skin and fell to the ground. 

At the same time, Yusong activated her bracelet, blocking and distorting the girl’s perception. The girl stumbled momentarily before letting out a metallic scraping sound. “What’s this? You’re using some strange power?” – *Clap!* As she clapped, eyeballs popped out of her hands! Ugh! What the heck is that? Not only was it repulsive to look at, but her newly formed eyes began to gather information, and the bracelet was blocked. But I’m a veteran now! No high school girl has seen as many monsters as I have! … Is this a good thing? Whatever, my head was already getting hot, so I immediately expanded the bracelet’s range. 

“Do you think you can stop me just because you have four eyeballs?” The moment the eyes on her hands were included in the bracelet’s range, the girl suddenly burst into laughter. “You! You’re quite strong!” 

At the same time, the mansion itself started to writhe as if it were alive. Eyeballs popped out from every corner, every wall, every clock, every table, every chair – the entire mansion became her eyes. I gritted my teeth and utilized ‘Multiple Perspectives’ with all my might, as I had since leaving Room 103. My consciousness lifted into the air. The power of Multiple Perspectives extended throughout the entire mansion. * –

I felt suffocated. I don't necessarily have some animalistic intuition, but even a fool could understand the situation. It’s that girl! The ruler of this hellish space! We have to take her down. The monster girl, holding Ari's severed head, treated bullets like BB pellets. She used butterflies on gorillas and guns were toys for her. There's no hope. 

Yusong, who possessed the only power that had any effect, was engaged in a fight in a realm I couldn't comprehend. This was a completely different story. Grandpa also looked helpless. … Now's not the time for that! 

Taking advantage of Yusong's time-buying efforts, I tried to escape toward the front door – “Don't bother me and stay still.”  A hand shot out from the wall and grabbed my leg. I desperately tried to pull it off with all my might, but it was useless. This girl was just playing around. It seemed like even her fight with Yusong wasn't a serious one. She must have observed us breaking through various mansions, becoming confident that we couldn't threaten her with this kind of power.

While Grandpa and I struggled, Yusong, unable to hold on any longer, started bleeding profusely from her eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. 

“Yusong!”  A chilling voice filled the room. “Is that your limit? Pathetic.” 

Yusong slumped to the ground, muttering, “You… what is this space?” The demonic girl slowly walked towards Yusong, her mouth stretched into a wide, cruel grin. As her heart was about to be ripped out, Yusong managed to utter her final words. 

“The window -”  Window? What window? Before she could finish, she died! I frantically looked around, but it had been confirmed from the first mansion. There were no windows in this mansion. All hope was lost after Yusong, the only one who could stop the demon, died.  Thick, tree root-like objects sprouted from the walls, tightly binding Grandpa this time. 

“Do you have any fun tricks?” * –

I had to use it. I kept my head down as much as possible, looking at the situation from behind the helmet of my protective suit. Ari, then Yusong, had fallen. Eunsol and Grandpa were also bound to the walls. But seeing how she didn't make any move to stop me, the monster seemed to think I was already dead or unconscious. … I'm not an idiot to the point of not knowing what might happen next. This monster clearly intends to deal with the rest of us cruelly.  I finally decided to use the escape button. Our beacon of hope that guaranteed our salvation only once in any crisis! We had discussed saving it for the very end, as it was a one-time use item, but this felt like the final moment. I reached for the button that Grandpa had kept by my side –  

– *Thump!* My hand collided with the table next to me, creating a loud noise. All eyes turned towards me. At the same time, the TV turned on! My body stiffened like a rock, accompanied by static noise. No, not at this time? I was flustered but quickly regained my composure. There was no way the TV turning on at this exact moment was a coincidence. This girl controlled all the monsters in this space. 

– *Ting!* *Tinkle!* In this awkward timing, my body was immobilized, the button fell to the floor, and rolled under the table. /Oath/  The familiar sound of the oath echoed from the TV as it blabbered on about nonsense. Our reaction was the same as before. Grandpa's gauntlet flew through the air, shooting at the TV, shattering it.  

“Oh! That’s right. You guys used the same tactic before. Sorry, sorry~ My memory is terrible!” Eunsol didn't answer, instead, she shot at the hand that had sprouted from the floor, binding her leg. The gunshot blew off the hand, and the bullet simultaneously shattered her leg. Amidst the chaos, Eunsol threw her entire body towards the button.  Grandpa's gauntlet also flew towards the button. 

Seeing this, the demon girl exclaimed with curiosity, “What is that thing anyway? Why are you making such a fuss?”  Another hand shot out from beside the button, grabbed it, and sank into the floor. Eunsol and Grandpa's faces filled with despair as the tree roots that had sprouted from the walls covered everyone. 

– *Splash… splash…* Blood already filled the room. Stepping on it, the girl, with the button now in her possession, approached me. I felt my breath becoming ragged. Her monstrous fingers brushed against my helmet. 

“Your suit is pretty durable, huh?”  

“...”

“Not answering? That Eunsol chick is still alive. Should I pull out her fingers one by one?”

“What are you curious about…?”

“Just curious.  Didn't you guys just observe for a while? Why are you suddenly throwing so many superhumans at me? What’s the reason? It’s too bad the one I could ask is dead.”  

What does she mean? I couldn't understand. Observed for a while? Suddenly throwing superhumans?  Is she referring to the Control Bureau, considering we’re supposed to be Control Bureau agents? As I became confused, the girl instantly sensed my uncertainty.  

“You don't know anything. You’re just a pawn.” 

– *Creak.  Clank.* 

“This suit is interesting. It's even durable enough to withstand Kongi's punches.”  My whole body felt hot again. And I was filled with resentment.  What the heck was ‘Heaven’s Favor’ doing? Since it activated, I hadn't been lucky once. Instead, my hand bumped against the table when I tried to use the escape button, making me get caught. … What the hell was that?

“Not fun?”

“It’s kind of boring.  Too weak, too predictable.”

“Sorry. I’ll make it more fun this time.” 

“Oh! That –”  The girl, realizing something was wrong, spun around.  Ari, only her head remaining, was sprawled out in a mess, and the blood that was all over the mansion started to move on its own! Strange light emanated from the eyes of Ari's head. The blood swirled like a vortex, binding the demonic girl! As I witnessed the incomprehensible scene, I felt like vomiting. At this moment, I couldn’t tell who was the demon and who was the hero of the Hotel Party!  Wasn’t this just two demons fighting?  

In the midst of this chaos, I forced my body to stand up. My head was spinning faster than usual, continuing my thoughts from before. Right now, I’m under the protection of ‘Heaven’s Favor,’ empowered by ‘the energy of the universe’! Nothing unlucky can happen to me.  My hand bumping into the table and dropping the button when I tried to use it – that wasn't bad luck; it was good luck! It was a sign for me not to use the one-time item, as I would be able to escape without it. The word ‘window’ that Yusong uttered before she died.  A strange mansion with no windows.  There was a window in this mansion.  A peculiar window that couldn't be seen from the inside but only from the outside.  I just hadn’t noticed because it didn't look like a typical window. 

I stood before the broken mirror, where the demon girl had emerged. I threw myself into the mirror, plunging my entire body inside. I felt an overwhelming gaze. A gaze. From the sky, the earth, the sea, the air, the mountains, the rivers – I felt gazes from every corner of the world. Every object in the universe was imbued with a great eye.  My beginning was as weak as a worm – 

– *Thump!* I fell endlessly before colliding with a protruding frame, regaining consciousness.  What? What did I just see? In confusion, my body continued to spin, slowly falling.  I fell endlessly into a darkness devoid of a floor, looking back at the mansion, or rather, the ‘collection of mansions’.  The mansions were constantly moving.  Rooms with monstrous beings, absurdly obvious to the eye, waited at intervals.  I fell and fell, thinking. The cursed room, Room 201. The identity of this damn place.  The Cube.  It was my last memory of Room 201. /You have escaped!/

*‘That guy escaped again by luck.’*
*‘How long is he going to be a freeloader?’*
*‘If he doesn't have any talent, he'll be finished in Room 203.’*

I woke up from a deep sleep, my mind suddenly becoming clear.  As I regained consciousness, an ice-cold feeling pierced my skin, sending chills down my spine!  I hastily gathered the blankets scattered around me to make a makeshift cold-protection suit.  

“Ugh! This is ridiculously cold! Wow! What is this weather?  Did everyone figure out a lot of things?” My teammates worked hard in my place!  Of course, they had amazing feats, right? Will we solve it in the next chapter?  I guess I can just go for the final blow, huh?  Whoa!  If I just took the spoils after going for the final blow, that would be a bit awkward!  No, I don't think so. Something felt off about the atmosphere. Some people were just sitting there blankly, not even feeling the cold.  I approached Elena, who was shivering uncontrollably.

“Are you alright?”

“...” Did she not hear me because of the blizzard?  I went a little closer –

– *Slap!*  Elena roughly shoved me, sending me tumbling into the snow. …  We’re not at the stage where we need to socially distance ourselves, right?   Something felt strange when our eyes met. Elena reacted as if she was about to faint. It seemed like everyone was in a rather serious situation. I decided to go down to the first floor and have a serious talk with everyone.  Of course, I feel incredibly refreshed after getting a good night's sleep. See you in the next chapter.
