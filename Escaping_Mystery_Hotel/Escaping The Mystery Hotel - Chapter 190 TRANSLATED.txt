– Han Gain

A few hours ago, while strategizing how to deal with Santa, the aspect I analyzed most diligently was 'Santa's behavior patterns'. What principle did Santa operate on? He was certainly different from a simple monster who indiscriminately slaughtered all humans in sight. I was able to find a few patterns. For example, he wouldn't truly act before Christmas, and he had to sing the appropriate carol when using magic. But what was the fundamental principle behind all this? The answer lay in the repeated words and actions of the demon Santa, the words etched on the metal sheet we found amongst the remnants of consciousness. "A reward for a good boy and a punishment for a bad boy." Santa appeared to give gifts to good children and punish bad ones. Upon realizing this, the first button of our plan was complete. Namely, preempting what Santa had to do!

Indeed, Santa began to display a rage he had never shown before. “You insufferable brats! Do you think Santa's job is simply giving out presents to children? You're wrong! Only 'good children' deserve gifts! Every child here has received a gift. That very action shows you understand nothing about Santa!” 

Santa's first claim was, 'Only good children deserve gifts'. This was a logic we had already anticipated! I immediately stood up and approached Santa. 

“Santa, you remember me from earlier, right?”

“Of course, I do. Gain, right? You've grown. I prepared your gift -”

“Grandpa, I remember what you said earlier. ‘There is no perfectly good person in the world. Everyone makes mistakes and gets dirty. What matters is to reflect and repent’. Right?”

“… That's right.”

“I realized something significant from your words, Grandpa! The important thing is reflection, isn't it? You said it yourself! It's definitely true, right?”

“…”

“Guys! It's time for a 'reflection reading'!”

… A moment of silence ensued. The children stared at me with confused expressions, wondering what I was up to. Santa's eyes began to turn menacing.

“Oh. It seems, unlike you, Gain, the other children haven't properly 'reflected'?”

Could this plan really go wrong like this? Because the kids didn't read their reflections? What the – The snow rabbit girl, Miro, stood up like a bolt of lightning.

“Reflection! I, the Maze -!”

“… Maze?”

“… I threw away all my broccoli at lunchtime yesterday. Also, I ate Ari's ham during dinner.”

Kim Ari: So that's why my ham was gone?

Han Gain: She forgot the content of the reflection she wrote earlier! Is she dumb?

Kim Ari: Don't talk about the Maze like that! 

“Also, also… I didn't study during math class and played snowball fights. But that's not a big mistake! Teacher joined in too. And I threw ice in the snowball fight and it hit Gain. But it's okay because Gain laughed. Um… I think I'm done?”

While Santa was momentarily speechless, Miro quickly kicked the child next to her.

“Hey! Thomas!”

“Y, yes?”

“Reflect! Reflect quickly!”

Santa muttered as if exhausted.

“Dear… you shouldn’t kick your friend.”

“Then I’ll reflect on that too. Now, hurry up and reflect!”

Unlike me, a recent transfer student, Miro, the school dictator, wielded power like a queen. Her words held a different level of authority. Thomas immediately stood up. 

“R, reflection! I, Thomas, hid my history test score from my dad last month.”

“…”

“And… and… Ah! I also hid my science test score. Haha! It's actually a trick I’ve been using lately. You know how easy it is to change the number '3' to '8'? So I changed 35 points to 85 points -”

… “I smeared bird droppings on Ms. Julia’s car last week.”

… “I fought with Steve. But he started it.”

“What, you little brat?”

“You drew on my book!”

“You broke my pen first!”

“Shut up, you both! Joshua! Reflect before I pull out your hair!”

“I’ll reflect on that too.” 

This feeling. I watched as Santa, who seemed somewhat bewildered, turned red with anger and glared at the Grandfather.

“You scoundrel! You are trying to ruin Christmas! How dare you, a worthless scum, dare to impersonate Santa!”

Santa's second claim was, 'Do you have the right to call yourself Santa?'

“Impersonate? Look at the way you talk! Do you have a Santa certificate? Did you pass the Santa exam?”

“Exam? What are you babbling about? To become Santa Claus, you don't need a certificate or an exam! Only a deep love for children qualifies you to be Santa Claus!”

“Love? I'm amazed that the word 'love for children' came out of your mouth! Hey, you, I love these kids too! I was originally a teacher in this school, and I care for the students more than you. And you, do you know the origin of Santa Claus?”

“O, origin?”

“Ha! You're ignorant. The original origin of Santa Claus is Saint Nicholas, the bishop of Christianity. Have you read the Bible?”

While Santa was speechless, the Grandfather proudly stated, “I, by the way, am a former Cardinal.”

Did the Cardinal of the Vatican from 'The House of Horror' come up here? It worked, incredibly!  Santa, who was wavering, seemed to be thinking about what to retort, but then he opened his mouth again.

“Santa isn't something you can become just by imitating the clothes! What were you doing last year? The year before? Have you ever considered giving love to children waiting for gifts on Christmas?”

The demon Santa's third claim was, 'Have you ever done Santa's work?'

“Oh! Now you want to bring up your experience? Good thing. I'm a new Santa starting this year, so it would be a contribution to the Santa world if you, who have already done so much, step aside, wouldn't it?”

“What nonsense are you talking? Why should I step aside?”

“You idiot, if veterans hog everything, where can new Santa’s gain experience? If you've eaten your fill, you should make room for new Santa to enter the industry!”

… My mind was going crazy. The two Santa's ‘I'm the real Santa’ battle began, and the children on the first floor simply stood with their mouths agape, unable to intervene. Even I was losing my mind listening to this. It's chaotic, but I feel like Grandpa is winning in terms of momentum. Did Santa feel the same way? After a long time, Santa began to tremble and suddenly started singing carols!

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Perhaps because he hadn’t yet distinguished between 'good children' and 'bad children'? People didn't immediately start dying. But there was definitely magic in that carol. As soon as the carol started, a blizzard raged on the first floor, and out of nowhere, a reindeer appeared!

Another carol battle? The demon Santa's fourth claim was, 'Can you sing carols properly?'

Grandpa was flustered, but then he started singing too.

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way 
Bells on bob-tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight!

Han Gain: You sing carols very well.

Kim Ari: You sing well~ 

This isn't the time! The momentum is waning, the momentum! 

Scanning the atmosphere, I could clearly feel it. Just going by singing ability wasn’t enough to stand toe-to-toe with the magical carol that summoned a blizzard and a reindeer. I felt like we were losing!  Soon, Santa, brimming with confidence, opened his mouth.

“That’s all you got? A guy who can't even sing a carol properly, dares to impersonate Santa?”

What should I do? The flow is so insane right now that I don’t know what to do! Suddenly, Miro stood up again and shouted,

“Guys! Sing along!”

“Huh? Huh?”

“M, Miro?”

“Sing along! Dashing through the snow!”

What the –

Kim Ari: You sing along too!

“Dashing through the snow! In a one-horse open sleigh!” 

Lost in the chaos, I, and the other children, simply followed the flow and sang the carol. And, for some reason, the momentum shifted back. This time, Grandpa chuckled. 

“Ha, listen. ‘Senior’. Despite boasting about your Santa experience, you still don’t understand the meaning of carols?”

“What do you mean?”

“Is summoning snow and reindeer the essence of carols? Who was the one who spoke about the deep love for children as the qualification of Santa Claus just now?”

“…”

“Look! See all these children singing the carol with me? This is the true carol!”

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

“Jingle bells, jingle bells! Jingle all the way! Oh! what fun it is to ride! In a one-horse open sleigh!”

The demon Santa couldn't utter a word and simply began to tremble. Is this the end? Isn't this enough? The atmosphere in the room shifted, feeling like a victory. Just then, Santa's trump card appeared.

— Whoosh. Whoosh!

The man-eating reindeer, who had been just as bewildered as us from the start, approached the demon Santa, and as if comforting him, nudged its face against his. The atmosphere seemed peaceful, as if a graceful reindeer was comforting an elderly man who had failed in his business. The demon Santa's mouth split open vertically again.

“Alright, alright. A teacher, a cardinal, you have a fancy resume, so I’ll acknowledge you have some minimum qualifications. I'll admit you know how to sing carols. But…”

Grandpa's expression hardened as he anticipated what was coming next. 

“Where is your ‘Rudolph’? Don’t tell me, as someone who claims to be Santa, you’re saying you don't even have a reindeer sleigh?”

The atmosphere in the school froze in an instant.
