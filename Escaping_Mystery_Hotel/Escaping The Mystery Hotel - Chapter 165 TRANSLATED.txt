## Chapter 164 – Room 201, The Cursed Room – ‘The Cube’ (13) – Eunsol Lee

Shortly after, a security smartphone for contacting the Administration was handed to me. About 5 seconds after I learned to operate the device with my grandfather's coaching, a call came. — Ring!

“Hello, customer! Monthly discounts from SaengSaeng Mart -”

“Agent Eunsol Lee, regular report.” — Beep! 

“There was a clash with a chaos entity within the mansion, so the report is 30 minutes late. As instructed, while exploring the Hesbut mansion, I found a room with a TV model different from the original mansion. However, I was unable to confirm any evidence related to the Arizona branch's corruption or Beatrice's survival after checking beyond the display. There is no evidence to support the speculation regarding Beatrice's corruption.” — Beep!

“Regular report, confirmed. Return.” …

“That should be enough, right? I reported everything the Administration asked me to check as having no evidence.” 

The expressions of those around me finally eased slightly. Seeing the atmosphere of relief at escaping the crisis, I added.

“You heard my report, right? The order to return? I have to go. So -”

Patrick chuckled and gestured to his subordinate next to him. “Thanks. Let’s meet again in a ‘new form’ soon.”

A soldier next to him immediately injected something, and a tingling sensation followed by a loss of consciousness. As expected, they didn’t have any intention of letting me go. Of course, that’s fine. I never intended to leave either! Why would I leave this place I worked so hard to get into already? * — Ding! — Ding! — Ding!

“Ugh, it’s so noisy!”

I regained consciousness. I woke up inside an opaque box in a white space. The chat window was blinking frantically. It said it could strengthen communication and send videos, but they're using it as an alarm.

Eunsol Lee: Awake. …

Eunsol Lee: Grandfather?

Kim Muksung: It’s fortunate you woke up before you died. Things outside are chaotic. I used some tricks, so be sure to wear the hazmat suit when you go out. You're a smart kid, so you'll figure it out. I'll rest first. 

It wasn't the usual sentence-saving language, and there was a subtle emotional tone. Even though I believe he will be resurrected, do we all change like this in the face of death? After that, I didn't hear my grandfather's response anymore.

As my grandfather said, there was a hazmat suit next to the box. What did my grandfather say to make the enemies leave the hazmat suit next to me? Did he say that it explodes if it’s separated from a living agent for an extended period? Who knows.

I was thinking for a moment about how to get out of the box when it opened on its own. As I stepped out, I saw someone spitting blood on the floor, crawling.

“Ugh, ugh!”

The man crawled desperately on the floor, but before he could get close to me, he breathed his last. Seeing that sight, I had a hunch. I immediately took off the hazmat suit helmet next to the box. …

It had been a long time since Seungyeop died, so the inside of the hazmat suit was truly beyond words. I’m the daughter of a well-off family, for God's sake! I have to wear this kind of clothing? But, seeing the man next to me spitting blood and dying, I felt a sense of determination.

I immediately pulled out Seungyeop's body and got inside the hazmat suit. My grandfather said in his last words that things outside are chaotic. I have a hunch. I remembered the regular report I made to the Administration before I passed out. ‘All suspicions about the mansion’s interior are false.’ 

Thinking from the Administration's perspective, the content I reported, the Arizona branch, the corruption, Beatrice, are all stories they never imagined! The Administration didn't know anything to begin with, and they just thought the Hesbut mansion was another common chaos disaster on Earth and sent an agent.

In a place like that, an agent suddenly reports and uses those words? The Administration is also a group that can understand things with a single glance. They would have understood the situation quickly. They would have realized the rough truth of the Hesbut mansion.

So, what did the Administration do?

Feeling a great deal of curiosity, I went outside. *

If there is hell, it would be a place like this? I thought while walking through the research institute, or headquarters, that was turning into hell in real time.

Patrick didn’t know anything about the Administration's true capabilities. I don't know what secrets they're hiding in their facilities, but even the Administration wouldn't be able to do anything about their facilities. His arrogant laughter that assumed they couldn't do anything to this place turned into a bitter price. 

The Administration's response was extremely efficient. I don't know where the headquarters' actual location is from Earth, the stage. They must have hidden it well, and even the Administration wouldn't have been able to find the enemy's headquarters immediately. 

Then, there is no way to infiltrate the headquarters other than through the already revealed entrance, a TV display somewhere in the Hesbut mansion. In this situation, it’s impossible for heavy weapons, helicopters, or tanks to enter the mansion before reaching the TV, so they can't be deployed.

Also, if what Patrick said isn’t completely untrue, it might have been a burden for the Administration to physically destroy this place. Deploying a large number of special forces? It's possible, but considering the situation where monsters are overflowing inside the mansion, they wouldn’t be able to avoid significant casualties. 

It’s difficult to deploy noisy equipment, it’s a burden to destroy the facility, and casualties are hard to avoid if special forces are deployed. The Administration's most efficient solution to respond to such a complex and challenging environment! The answer was right before my eyes.

Drones equipped with biochemical weapons were coming in countless numbers, turning the headquarters into hell. The drones flew around in real time, installing silver boxes everywhere in the research institute. A white mist came out of the boxes, killing the creatures inside the headquarters. 

Fortunately, the hazmat suit, a hotel special that boasts of its resistance to swords and fire, was able to block the unidentified biochemical weapon, which was a deadly virus or poisonous gas. 

*

“This facility is disgusting.” 

It’s not easy to figure out where everything is, and there are many places that outsiders can’t enter. Most people died because of the biochemical weapon, but the security system is still operating. How is my current situation? Are my colleagues alive? I doubt it. If my colleagues had killed Beatrice, wouldn’t the cursed room have already disappeared? 

Most importantly, Seungyeop, who headed towards Beatrice, came back dead. I had a hunch about where I should go. The corpses scattered throughout the research institute uniformly died while running in a specific direction. This place they were trying to reach before they died would probably be the passage connected to the outside.

However, I don't intend to escape right away. Because this place clearly holds Cain, Pero, and many other secrets! The people who would have interfered with the exploration were exterminated by the Administration’s special biochemical weapon. With this...

“It’s the best condition for exploration.”

The only risk factor is Beatrice returning to headquarters.

Inside the hazmat suit, I grabbed the item Seungyeop had held tightly until his death. 

‘Escape button.’

Let’s explore further with this. *

The first place I found was the research building. I was able to easily find Room 2-9, where Pero is.

“The door is locked.”

I thought about it for a moment, but soon found a solution. I wouldn’t have been able to do it if it was the usual me, but now I'm wearing a hazmat suit! The hazmat suit provides superhuman strength through its internal drive system, something an ordinary human couldn’t achieve. — Bang! Bang! 

After repeating the body slam about five times, the door finally collapsed. — Screech!

“How have you been?”

The grotesque, which I now think is kind of cute, greeted me. 

You were already out? What is going on?

I looked around and understood the situation roughly. Pero was probably in the transparent box in the middle of the room. The box must have been completely isolated from the outside. From another perspective, it's also an isolation room for survival in this situation where biochemical weapons are everywhere. 

Some of the researchers probably released Pero to survive and tried to get into the box themselves. Now that I think about it, it’s exactly the same as when I woke up, and the box I was trapped in opened automatically. At that time, a researcher must have opened the box on their own to get in instead of me. 

Of course, Pero killed all the researchers as soon as he got out. The researchers knew the danger but took a gamble. Well, it's none of my business. — Beep!

“Yeah, yeah. Let's go. And you need to clean your beak. It’s kind of ugly to have a human finger stuck in your beak, even for you.”

As I left the research building with Pero, a notification popped up.

“...You were also sealed?” *

After that, I kept searching the headquarters and finally found a plausible place.

“Alright, Pero. It's your turn to shine.” — Beep!

“Stop beeping and transform already? I’m going to have to open it with a body slam again, huh?” — C-queak?

“If you act cute one more time, I might only buy acorns for a month instead of sunflower seeds. I know you understand me, so move now.”

Pero, who was acting really annoyed, eventually transformed and tore off the door. Why are you so lazy when you haven’t done anything so far? You follow Songi’s orders like a knife, but you ignore my orders about buying you food? Did I give you too much sunflower seed?

Inside the office, there was Patrick's corpse. He must have tried to survive until the last moment, because there was evidence that he had blocked the door crack with tissues or paper scraps. It’s a shame, but he couldn’t escape the Administration’s special biochemical weapon.

Now that I think about it, I was quite lucky. If the place I was locked up in was a simple room with a locked door, I would have died. It seems they locked me in a special box to keep the chaos entity sealed, and thanks to that, I survived. 

... I spent a long time reading the documents scattered around the office, Patrick's personal diary.

“It’s incredible. Could these events have happened in reality too? Pero, what do you think?” — C-queak?

“Sunflower seeds confiscated for a month.” — K-eeeee-ing???

I think I almost figured out Room 201’s scenario. I have a rough idea of how to solve it. The cursed room is always like that. Before you know it, you have no idea what's going on, and it feels like you’re flailing around in the fog, but…

The solution is surprisingly simple once you know it. I also found out where Cain is. However, I don’t think I can release him from his seal this time. It’s a place I can’t reach with my current ability.

Now, let's go. I know how to solve Room 201. *

I went out of the office and moved towards the direction the corpses were facing. … 

It should be around here? I think I'm almost there, but there aren't any corpses nearby, so I don't know the exact location. Maybe the people who came this far somehow managed to escape? — Bang!

“Eeek?”

The whole facility started to shake! There were loud sounds of something bursting and collapsing. It's so chilling! It’s truly chilling! I hurriedly opened all the nearby doors and passages.

“Where is it? Where is it, really?”

“Second one from the left.”

“Thanks! I won’t forget it.”

“You’re welcome.”

Relieved by the sudden help, I opened the second door from the left — ... 

I turned my head back, and there was a being more terrifying than the Grim Reaper! 

“You have finally ruined everything.”

The other's appearance was that of a young girl, but I spoke formally.

“That… I didn’t do it.”

“You, this trash -”

I turned around and ran desperately! Please save me! — Bang!

Something kicked me with tremendous force, sending me flying almost 10 meters in an instant.

“Pero!”

Pero, the golden parrot blessed by the heavenly angel, the great golden balloon, who descended from the heavens! Pero kicked me towards the exit and charged at Beatrice!

I have no time to look back. I'm going to NAVER anymore! I just ran and ran like crazy. As I ran out the door, throwing my whole body into it — an incredible sight entered my vision.

Are they planning to obliterate a whole city? There were helicopters and splendid robots that made me doubt it! Is this the power of the Administration prepared to exterminate Beatrice? …

The second attempt is over. /You have escaped!/ Continue to next chapter.
