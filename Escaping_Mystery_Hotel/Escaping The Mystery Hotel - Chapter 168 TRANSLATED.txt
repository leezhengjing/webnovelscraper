## Chapter 167 - Room 201, The Cursed Room - ‘The Cube’ (16) - Kim Ari… 

This is a strange space. The space beyond the TV is a blindingly white and vast room. As planned, all my other companions, through my blood, believe “this place is safe,” and begin to walk with their eyes closed. Only I, with Song-Yi’s bracelet protecting me, continue to move through the space with my eyes open. 

Why do I pass through this space with my mind clear, even though I know how to do it safely? It's simple. I wanted to see for myself what this so-called “Zero-Dimensional Eye” is. The Zero-Dimensional Eye, perhaps the prisoner of Room 201. What role does he play in this scenario? Up until now, I haven’t been able to find any other role for him, besides being a part of the scenario's background setting. 

He is neither an antagonist like the “Swallowing One,” nor does he give power to the antagonist like “Headmaster,” nor is he worshipped as a god by the antagonist like “Lord.” If we must compare, he is similar to the “Cosmic Dragon,” who had no presence until just before the final battle. The role of the Zero-Dimensional Eye is still unknown. Perhaps it is something that Gain, who will awaken from the seal, needs to uncover?

In the distance, I saw about 20 members of the military force prepared by headquarters. According to Eun-Sol, the total number of soldiers in the entire facility is about 30, with the rest being researchers. They’ve brought in the majority of them. 

In this space, there is the Zero-Dimensional Eye. They cannot even dare to approach us, and they just wait for us to arrive. 

…Thanks to the bracelet’s protection, I seem to have avoided losing consciousness as soon as I entered. Should I check it now? The moment I raised my head, I sank to the ground. An overwhelming gaze violently pierced through me! Even though I wasn’t the bracelet’s owner, I felt it instinctively. There is no way I can last long. It was a being that I shouldn’t have looked at! This is my own fault, my arrogance in trying to satisfy my pathetic curiosity. Mistake, mistake, 𝑀𝐼𝑆𝑇𝐴𝐾𝐸 𝑀𝐼𝑆𝑇𝐴𝐾𝐸 𝑀𝐼𝑆𝑇𝐴𝐾𝐸 L ㅓㅏIᅟᅥᆷ리ㅏ더집 RKKJ;L53NCV15POV-UMOF0QM56NJK3L23BJK543 NBJ-L4FZD908S1238815FA809SD85B5HJ4K25GLP31P5HJ2KJ4131030503450412JK42314J * "I’ll forgive you this time since it seems like it’ll be fun from now on." * 

The gaze that was tearing me apart vanished. Just before my consciousness completely faded away, with my mind half gone, and even the letters and numbers in my head crumbling, I was released. I don’t know. I don't know what that being is. One thing is clear: that being is of an immeasurable caliber, incomparable to Beatrix, or “something like her.” How did the Head Researcher seal such a being? What kind of human is he?

“Ari?” I was leading my companions, who were still closing their eyes, like a girl playing a flute. When I suddenly stopped, Song-Yi, who had been waiting, looked puzzled. Let's go. If we delay any longer, there is a risk that the suggestion placed on our companions will be released. I don’t know why, but the pressure that the Zero-Dimensional Eye was imposing has vanished. The headquarters forces are still waiting far away, unaware. This is good! It's always right to move sooner than the opponent expects!

Kim Ari: Start!

Simultaneously, all of my companions’ eyes opened. After the seal was released, our ninth companion, who hadn't even chirped on Song-Yi’s shoulder, flew up into the sky.

“Go! Bio-Flashbang!” * – Eun-Sol “Go! Bio-Flashbang!” What is that supposed to mean? Is it a 70s gag? Although, Pero is playing a role similar to a living flashbang… Pero, in the middle of it all, looked back at Ari with a quick turn of his head before flying forward and transforming. — *Kieeeeek!* *Kieeeeek!* A screaming sound pierced our ears, and chaos erupted! We had covered our ears in advance and prepared our minds, but the opponent hadn’t. The headquarters’ military force, caught off guard, started firing at each other like maniacs. At that moment! Cha Jin-Cheol, who had summoned the stars, flew in like a cannonball. With a loud bang, the headquarters’ soldiers began flying into the sky. Jin-Cheol, wearing a high-performance bulletproof vest, ran wild with the stars in his hands, making him look like a complete invincible superhuman. In the meantime, Song-Yi arrived and used her bracelet to flash brightly, causing the soldiers to fire at each other. Grandpa and Ari also pulled the trigger repeatedly. … Everyone is fighting well. Elena, Seung-Yeop, and I are just watching from behind. 

About 15 minutes passed. The fight was slowly coming to an end. A considerable number of soldiers had been killed or had fled, and a loud noise reverberated from headquarters. Cha Jin-Cheol ran towards me. 

“Sister, have we practically taken care of everyone?”

“There should be more than 10 people left inside headquarters. Even so, it shouldn’t be much of a problem for you now. Anyway, Jin-Cheol, you look like a complete superhero from a hero movie. When you were lifting one soldier with each hand and throwing them, you really looked like that green monster.”

“Haha! It’s not just my strength, it’s thanks to this suit.”

“Bulletproof vest? It blocks bullets from penetrating, but it doesn’t block all the impact.”

Jin-Cheol just smirked. Well, the impact is a problem for ordinary humans like me and Song-Yi, not for him.

“Is there no way to get this suit from the hotel? If I could just wear this suit in the other cursed rooms, I could become about 1.5 times stronger.”

It’s not just an ordinary bulletproof vest, it’s a special product of the Administration, so it will be difficult to obtain. Grandpa opened his mouth with a tense expression. 

“Beatrix hasn’t come.”

I looked slightly behind me and replied, “We’ve put distance between us, but this place is basically a space where the Zero-Dimensional Eye exists. Perhaps she doesn't want to fight here.”

— *Click!* Jin-Cheol opened the door leading to headquarters. It’s time for the next phase. *Honestly, in the previous fight, I just sucked my thumb. My role is important from now on. That’s why I’m wearing the protective suit!* After gesturing briefly to my companions, I prepared to blend in with my surroundings, slightly putting distance between me and the others. — *Bang! Bang! Bang!* Gunfire is heard from all directions. — *Wooooosh!* I felt the waves of the stars piercing my skin, as though they were stabbing through my protective suit. Meanwhile, I focused all my attention on the Monocular Eye, searching for Patrick. … … I found him. 

Eun-Sol: Patrick located.

As instructed, my companions started to create chaos in the area as loudly as possible. Cha Jin-Cheol suddenly jumped towards me as if to shoot me, and Pero screeched repeatedly. With my breath held, I became transparent and approached Patrick. Patrick was observing the situation next to a specially shaped passageway. If something goes wrong, he’ll probably escape through this passageway. That will be tiresome for all of us. As I opened the brooch, the butterfly was about to fly immediately - *No.* While you fly at your slow pace, Patrick will surely see your gorgeous appearance and run away. Trust your master this time. Holding onto the butterfly, I approached Patrick directly. I’ve been holding my breath for too long to become transparent, and I'm starting to feel short of breath. I hear a voice. 

“What the hell is that guy? He’s been hit 10 times already!”

“He doesn’t seem to have an ordinary body!”

“I can see that, you moron! Where is Beatrix? Is the escape route ready?”

“She’ll be here soon! It’s not even been a few minutes since those guys started running wild. The escape route will be ready within 10 minutes.”

“Throw a bomb!”

“Patrick, that…”

“There’s no other choice, is there? If we continue like this, the facility will -”

“Hello~!” With a light wave of my hand, I planted the butterfly on Patrick’s body. My appearance immediately became visible, and as the bodyguards tried to grab me, Patrick collapsed with a rough groan! The bodyguards were startled and tried to move Patrick somewhere, but I just held onto him. Yes, protective suit~! With this on, I’m super strong too! The bodyguards, with their faces crimson, try to pull me off, but it’s no use! Yes, the protective suit is super heavy~! I’m enjoying the feeling of being like 0.3 Cha Jin-Cheol, so I stubbornly endure. In the end, my companions, who had cleared the area, joined us. The end is in sight. We’ve secured Patrick.

“Eun-Sol unni! You did a good job.”

“This is just the beginning. Now, hold onto this guy.”

While Cha Jin-Cheol held onto Patrick, I retrieved the Nightmare Butterfly. Time-wise, it feels like less than 5 minutes, but Patrick looks like he’s aged 10 years. The moment the butterfly came out, a groan filled with pain erupted from his mouth.

“Ugh! Ugh!”

“Now just take him to the third floor. Ari?”

Ari had a troubled expression.

“Ari?”

“Even when we were planning, I said it was a bit unsettling.”

“Do you think the hypnosis won’t work well?”

“Yeah. He’s not an ordinary person.”

Meanwhile, Patrick regained consciousness.

“Ugh… The third floor. The third floor… It’s where the seal and He is. The Administration guys… They wouldn’t be trying to break the seal, would they? Did you come to rescue the Head Researcher?”

“You’re not completely clueless, are you?”

“Heehee… How amusing. Did you really come to rescue him? Do you fools think the Head Researcher is a true hero who saved the world? Do you know why I betrayed him? You gears… know nothing about -”

“Are we just going to listen to this guy endlessly? We don't have time, so let's hurry. Ari.”

Cha Jin-Cheol is right. We don’t know when Beatrix might show up. Ari also sighed and stared into Patrick’s eyes, like she did with Elizabeth before. After about 3 minutes, Patrick started to move according to Ari's instructions, with saliva dripping from his mouth.

“Is it good?”

“Probably.”

“That’s an unsettling answer.”

“I've said it many times, but he’s not an ordinary person, so I can’t guarantee it. Don’t let your guard down and keep an eye on him.”

Headquarters, where most of the people had either died or fled, and we moved towards our destination with Patrick in tow. There were several doors that outsiders couldn't enter, but since we had secured Patrick, it was not difficult to get past. … As we walked, a question I hadn’t thought about before came to mind. 

“Ari.”

“Yeah?”

“Why did Patrick betray him in the first place?”

“…”

“Think about it. This guy was originally a high-ranking official in the Administration. He was a high-ranking official in the Arizona branch. Would the Administration treat such a person lightly? They must have given him a lot of wealth and honor. That itself is a strong deterrent against betrayal.”

“That must have been the case. If you have that kind of position in the Administration, you could have accumulated enough wealth to feed your grandchildren and still have some left over.”

“But why did he betray them? In exchange for betrayal, he ended up living in the shadows, among monsters. He can't even easily leave this stuffy headquarters.”

Seung-Yeop replied, “Maybe Beatrix threatened him?”

“That could be, but based on the content of the records and his tone, it doesn’t feel that way. I felt that Patrick and Beatrix had more of a collaborative relationship, like business partners, rather than a one-sided relationship.”

Ari agreed. “Even though Beatrix is strong, she is ultimately an experimental subject under the control of the Head Researcher. Even if she had been fortunate enough to be released, would she have had the ability to manage this huge facility? From the management of the Cube to the underground facilities where the monsters are stored. This kind of facility management is something that a devil girl who has been experimented on her entire life can’t do. This is the domain of an expert who has accumulated relevant knowledge for decades.”

There is one point that we have consistently questioned while making plans. Considering our speculation and the advice that the Owl gave us, it is clear that the Head Researcher had a means to control Beatrix. But why did he lose control? Simply because he was careless? He is not a careless person. He is an incredible man who sealed the Zero-Dimensional Eye and saved the world. Is it easy to accept that he was careless and lost control to his own experimental subject?

…Perhaps. Patrick betrayed the Head Researcher and released Beatrix in the process. That would make sense of how the Head Researcher was defeated. He must have prepared a means to control Beatrix, but it would be difficult to predict that an internal administrator would betray him. 

Why did he betray him? Why did he betray his superior, who saved the world with the power of his experimental subject, abandoning the wealth and honor that the Administration provided?

I recall what Patrick said before he fell under Ari’s suggestion. *“Do you fools think he is a true hero who saved the world?”*

To be continued.
