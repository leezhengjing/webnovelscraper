## Chapter 176 – Party Time – Blessing Sanctuary (3)

**Date:** 89th Day

**Current Location:** Layer 1, Corridor

**Sage’s Advice:** 3

— Worrying is one thing, but now is the time to claim our rewards! In a way, this might be one of the most enjoyable moments in this hardship-filled hotel, right? As we approached the Blessing Sanctuary on the first floor, everyone’s faces brightened.

We entered the Blessing Sanctuary. 

**“Strengthening for Park Seungyeop/Elena Ivanova is possible. Do you wish to proceed? (Y/N)”**

“What? Why are there so few names?” Everyone was taken aback. Why are there so few people eligible for strengthening? I had already guessed that my name wouldn’t be there after obtaining ‘Scenario Understanding,’ since the owl had said it would be a long time until our next meeting. But why are the other people’s names missing too? Didn’t many people play their roles in the Gateway Chamber? Ari was even the final survivor. 

… A sad answer came to mind.

“I guess the ‘Gateway Chamber’ isn’t included in the contribution calculation.” Ari sighed and answered. “I wondered why there was no party time after the Gateway Chamber. So that’s why, because we didn’t need to go to the Blessing Sanctuary.”

Seungyeop replied, his voice somewhat hopeful. “I got recognition for escaping alone in the first attempt of room 201!”

My sister felt a little wronged. “I escaped alone in the second attempt too?”

“Sister, you got the Hand of Greed strengthened relatively recently. It’s probably not your time yet.” Jincheol oppa spoke nonsense. “If they just showed us the damn contribution numbers, there wouldn’t be any confusion! Based on my experience, hiding something like this is definitely a dirty trick to steal something from someone!”

“Who would benefit from stealing our contribution points….”

“…” What was the point of arguing further? In the end, the two of them received the blessing strengthening.

**Park Seungyeop**

My body felt like it was being sucked somewhere, and my mind went blank. As I managed to steady my swaying body, a familiar line rang in my ears.

‘Welcome to Summoner’s Rift!’ 

… This place feels familiar? The dark and somewhat stuffy air, computers everywhere. If there was just an employee at the front, it would be exactly like a PC Bang, but there’s no employee. Only one computer was turned on, playing music I’ve heard countless times.  Sitting in front of the computer was a boy who looked my age, completely focused.

“Excuse me….”

“Just a minute! I’m almost done!” 

“… You’re just doing backdoor with 5 death trinity. Our main team is getting pushed back.”

“It’s alright! As long as they hold on, we’ll be fine.”

After a while, the conclusion came.

**Illustrate: Click**

“…”

“…”

“Are you alright?”

“… How can you play this game all day? I’m already exhausted after just a few rounds. Why is my team luck so bad?”

Those words, coming from the Patron of Fortune, left me speechless. It’s obviously because you keep dying 5 times and just doing backdoor, so you’re losing! It’s not your team’s luck that’s bad, it’s the teammates who got paired with you who are unlucky! I couldn’t bring myself to say it.  Even though he’s a Patron, I had to endure it.

Noticing my look of disdain, the boy smirked and said, “I’m playing exactly the same way you did before you came to the hotel.”

“That’s not true!”

“What’s different?”

“Wow! You, this - no, Patron, you don’t know anything about League of Legends!”

“You’re not saying ‘this jerk’ to me, are you?”

“You think mindless backdooring and splitting are the same thing? Wow! I didn’t expect to hear this from someone who doesn’t even know the basics of lane management. Do you even know the difference between leaving 6 ranged minions and 3? Do you know how to make a big wave? Why did you pick your skills like that? At 21 minutes on Red -”

“No, no. I lost. I’m sorry. Let’s talk about our blessings.”

“…”

“Your parents really must have suffered.”

“What are you saying? I was really trying to hold back -”

“No, no, let’s talk about the blessing now. I’ve had some pretty interesting experiences since meeting you, but I don’t want to become the first Patron in hotel history to get beaten by a participant.”

“…Yes.”

The boy lightly waved his hand, and the PC Bang scenery vanished, replaced by an office-like space with a clean table and chairs.

“What kind of strengthening are you getting this time?”

“That’s a good question. My answer is, ‘I’m not receiving any strengthening this time.’”

“…”

The Patron observed me for a moment before exclaiming in amazement. “You’re incredible! You went through all that hell in the hotel, and even after being told there’s no reward, your expression hasn’t changed much. Seeing this, it seems like you have quite a bit of patience…”

“What are you trying to say again?”

“It just seems like you’re a different person whenever a certain topic comes up. Anyway, I’m not saying that there is absolutely no reward. You already heard it from your teammate, Hanganin, right? If you gather enough contribution, you can get a powerful strengthening.”

“Oh! So we proceed to the next room and get a powerful strengthening?”

“That’s right. But….”

“But?”

“You need to be active in the next room. Your contribution is quite lacking.”

“Then can’t we just get a weaker strengthening that corresponds to the contribution we’ve already earned -”

“No. You need to get a powerful strengthening.”

“…”

“You already got a hint of it. Room 203?”

“Yes.”

“The strengthening I’m going to give you there will be very useful. Compared to your teammates, you’re lagging behind a bit. You know that, right?”

“…Yes.”

“You still haven’t obtained any legacies. Room 203 will be both a crisis and an opportunity for you.”

“So room 202 is just a hopeless situation? It’s just expected?”

“Honestly, it’s not a room where you can make enough contributions to get a legacy. Still, try your best. You need to gain some contribution in room 202 to receive the next strengthening.”

As I listened, I became curious. Why is it that I’m unlikely to get a legacy in room 202, but room 203 is both a crisis and an opportunity? Noticing my expression, the boy immediately answered.

“You’re not trying to ask about the content of the next room, are you?”

“…”

“Of course, I can’t answer that.”

“Is it possible to ask other questions? For example, what is the ‘powerful strengthening’?”

The boy gave a somewhat ambiguous look before answering. “It will increase the ‘predictability’ of your abilities.”

‘Predictability’? I have no idea what that means. The boy looked at something else before continuing. 

“You’re worried because the hotel is getting colder, right?”

“Oh! Are you trying to give me a hint?”

“It’s different from the Curse Chamber. Not everyone needs to participate.”

“What?”

“You don’t have to push yourself too hard.”

What does that mean? 

With those words, my consciousness faded.

**Elena**

It’s a beautiful garden I experienced once before. I could hear birds singing from somewhere, and the scenery of the garden was like a painting drawn with watercolor paints. As soon as I entered, a worried voice reached me.

“You’ve obtained a dangerous power.”

“Hello.”

“I was hoping you wouldn’t obtain any power that affects your mind.”

“… I think the Irregular Polyhedron will be difficult for me to handle.”

“That’s true.” 

They say it’s an item that requires high intelligence to use, and hearing the words “it’s true that you will find it difficult to handle,” I felt a little bad. The Patron then smirked and continued.

“You don’t need to be a genius to handle the Irregular Polyhedron. However, you do need some calculating ability. And in that regard, don’t you have talented teammates?”

“That’s right…”

“Actually, the power of ominous premonitions isn’t a bad fit for you. In fact, few people can use it as well as you. It requires rich imagination, so it’s not a weak power at all. It’s just that the side effects are great and it’s difficult to control.”

“Come to think of it, when I obtained this ability, Gahin said that if I use ominous premonitions, I’m likely to develop a mental illness. But I haven’t felt anything like that yet. I just feel scared because I keep seeing strange monsters.”

“That’s because you haven’t actually used it properly yet. You’re struggling not to use it now, and it’s only because the power is slightly leaking out while you’re not paying attention.”

“I see.”

I became even more worried. Isn’t that saying that if I start using it properly, I’m bound to go crazy!

“Don’t worry too much. I was originally going to give you a different ability, but after seeing that you obtained ominous premonitions, I prepared an appropriate blessing strengthening. Correct faith takes root in a clear and calm mind.”

“What? Th, thank you!”

“However, the power I’m giving you will only reduce the side effects of ominous premonitions. You need to figure out how to use it yourself.”

“I’ll try my best.”

“Talk to that annoying guy you like about your abilities.”

“What??? What are you talking about???”

“What are you surprised about? It seems like you’re the only one who doesn’t know.”

“No, no, no, no,”

“Just leave the ‘no, no’s’ aside and go down now.”

With those words, my mind drifted like being swept away by a wave. As my consciousness blurred, I heard one last sentence.

“The problems related to the cold are not something you should get involved in.”

What does that mean?

**Hanganin**

After the two of them received their blessing strengthening and passed out, we moved them to a safe location and went to the tea table. The grandfather raised his cup and sighed, saying, “It’s getting worse and worse. Look at this.”

“Since when did you start liking green tea ice cream?”

“At least the ice cream has flavor… The condition of the first floor is deteriorating rapidly.”

It wasn’t just a few pieces of ice floating in the tea, it was literally an ice block of green tea. I couldn’t help but laugh dryly.

“What should we do?”

At Songyi’s question, everyone fell silent for a moment. It’s my turn to break the silence. I have something I want to say, especially since no one else knows this.

“Just a moment.”

My sister answered immediately.

“It’s about the advice, right?”

“Yes. As I said this morning, I’m going to use today’s advice for room 104.”

Ari gave an ambiguous response.

“Wouldn’t the problem of the hotel getting colder be more urgent than room 104?  I think it’s better to use the advice for that, but…”

“That’s true, but there’s never been a time since we’ve been here when there wasn’t a pressing issue. Plus, the party time is 3 days, right? Today is the first day.”

“We can ask on the second and third day, right?”

“Right. And…”

There’s a gut feeling I can’t explain with words. I’ve been feeling it for a while now. Perhaps it’s the conviction that came to me the moment I obtained Divine Descent, which grew stronger after using Divine Descent once in room 102. I must stand before the ‘Lord’ again and settle this.

“Then ask. It’s your blessing in the end, so it’s up to your decision. As you said, we can ask about the hotel getting colder starting tomorrow.”

The moment I decided to use the advice, I suddenly had no idea what to ask. What question should I ask? What is the ‘Lord’s’ scheme? Will I really betray my companions in room 104?  It’s such an expensive question, requiring all three uses, making it difficult to choose just one -

**To be continued.**
