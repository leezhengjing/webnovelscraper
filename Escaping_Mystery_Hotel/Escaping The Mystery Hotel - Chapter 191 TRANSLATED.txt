## Chapter 190 – A Prayer for the Labyrinth (9)

**Date:** Day 94
**Current Location:** Labyrinth of Hell
**Sage's Advice:** 3

– Santa Claus's fifth argument was, "How can you call yourself Santa without even Rudolph?" Wow! Rudolph is here too? I missed this whole thing from the start! If they brought Pero too, could Pero claim to be Santa's Rudolph? What if Pero started pulling Santa's hair during this argument? What if Santa gets angry and slaps Pero? ... Snap out of it. My mind is going crazy, and I keep having strange thoughts. It's a pointless story unless Pero is here. It's also difficult to control Pero subtly without "Songi".

Santa threw out a random statement. "You know, I have Rudolph too."

Hangain: "You do?"

Kim Muksung: "Do something! Now!"

Kim Ari: "Just buy us some time!"

What is Ari trying to do in the middle of this? Did she realize that Santa just blurted out something random? 

Santa started laughing. "Haha! You're out of prepared excuses, are you? Of course, a fake Santa wouldn't be ready for a real Santa! You should know, impersonating Santa is a serious crime!"

"I said I have Rudolph! You punk, I can't make Rudolph appear right now because I'm not a magician like you! You wouldn't be saying magic is essential for Santa, would you?"

"Then where exactly is it? If my eyes aren't failing me, I don't see your Rudolph anywhere - "

—  *Woooong!* *Bang!*

An 82-year-old Ford Granada crashed through the 'main gate' where Santa entered and went into the school. The Ford, which was moving at an incredible speed, drifted naturally and knocked over the reindeer that was peacefully posing next to Santa.

"Kweeek!"

"Komeeeet! Komeet!"

A reindeer screaming while flying, and Santa spitting out cries of despair as he witnessed the sight. I don't know who the villain is anymore!

In the midst of this, Ari smiled brightly. "Rudolph's here!"

I don't know anymore.

"What the hell! Who said a car is Rudolph?"

"Hey! What's wrong with a car being Rudolph?"

"You think that makes sense?"

"The world is constantly evolving! This is the era where ceramics produced in China come to America by boat, you idiot. You're a relic of the past, an old Santa still riding a sleigh! In today's world, Rudolph is cars and airplanes."

"Haha! You can't even see the terrified children, can you?"

It's obvious. Until now, it felt like crazy old men were just talking nonsense, and the kids were giggling. But when a car crashed through the main gate, the kids lost their minds completely. 

"You really are a bunch of bastards! I was wrong to try to talk to these crazy fools! You're not worthy of living. I'm going to blow your brains out one by one!" 

*Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way.*

"Eeet! It won't work? You even brought a car?"

"How can that work? How can this crazy gamble succeed?"

Both Ari and I were going crazy, thinking that the second attempt failed, but then we heard a song.

"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer~ Had a very shiny nose."

?

The whole school was filled with shock, and Miro walked towards the 82-year-old Ford Granada with a 'what the hell' expression. Everyone in the room, from children to teachers, from the hotel party to even Santa, was looking at Miro, wondering what kind of crazy thing was going to happen next.

What emerged from Miro's hand was a cherry from the top of a Christmas cake. 

"On a foggy Christmas day~ Santa said~ Rudolph's nose shines brightly~ So pull the sleigh!"

— *Poof!* 

The cherry was stuck on Ari's nose. 

"Now you're Rudolph, right? Your nose is bright now, isn't it?"

The change started.

*We wish you a merry Christmas. We wish you a merry Christmas. And a happy New Year!*

The carol changed to Korean.

From the moment we arrived at the school until now, the magical carol that had never stopped for a single moment began to lose its power.

Ari's surprised cry could be heard.

"It, it worked? If I just stick a cherry on my nose, I'm Rudolph?"

Santa's body began to crumble like sand. A tired voice could be heard.

"I… I thought the air felt strange when I first arrived at this school… I couldn't believe that it would be a school full of crazy people, from children to old men…"

It's true that they're crazy, but shouldn't a child-killing Santa be saying that?

There was only one person filled with joy and excitement.

"See, I told you! I told you! Santa's dying because I put a cherry on his nose! Wow, I guess I'm really smart! Right?"

“…Yeah. I was really surprised just now.”

“Ahaha! I'm a genius among geniuses! Should I become an exorcist? It looks like so much fun!”

You've already been one. And a very experienced one at that.

"Everyone, clap! Clap! Why aren't you clapping?"

— *Clap! Clap! Clap!*

Everyone started clapping towards Miro with a soulless expression. Miro, with cheeks flushed with excitement, began to pluck cherries from the cake and stick them on the noses of those around him.

I, according to Miro, Rudolph No. 4, managed to hang onto my sanity and looked at Santa. Santa, who had been speaking with a sense of despair like a sage's time had come, disappeared leaving only a small doll behind.

The magical power of the carol was gone somewhere. I don't know what happened, but the children were laughing and having fun. And in the middle of it all, a girl filled with happiness was roaring in victory.

Whatever happened, it's a happy ending!

Slowly, the space began to collapse. The labyrinth of hell, filled with nightmares, began to disappear into the other side of time and space.

Unlike Ari, who felt a heartwarming feeling with emotional eyes as she watched Miro roar, Grandfather and I had a truly exhausted expression.

“…Good work.”

“You did well too.”

“You're quick-witted. I couldn't believe you could respond to Santa's nonsense so well.”

As the ending approached, we were waiting for a rest, thanking each other for our hard work. Then everything stopped.

The swirling snow, the carol now in Korean, the teachers who had lost their minds and didn't know how to handle the aftermath, the children who were having fun even though they didn't understand anything. All the sounds stopped, and the collapsing space stopped collapsing.

As Grandfather, Ari, and I looked at each other, wondering what was going on, a familiar yet 'different' voice could be heard.

"You really came to save me."

There was something nostalgic about the atmosphere. Ari's eyes widened in shock, but Miro naturally went up to her and hugged her.

"M, Mom? Do you recognize me now?"

"Of course. It's strange that I didn't recognize you until now because of the hotel's tricks. We're so alike, you see?"

This is strange.

"Mom…"

This is strange. 

Unlike Ari, who couldn't handle the torrent of emotions and cried because Miro was acting 'like a mother' for the first time in her life, Grandfather and I were shocked and wide-eyed.

"Wait! Are you in your right mind right now?"

Ari, who finally noticed the anomaly, was startled and stepped back. 

Miro from the hotel, while we don't know exactly what happened, lost her sanity while creating Ari! Until now, it was the time before she created Ari, a time when Miro was younger, so it was natural for her to be sane. But the current Miro was different from 'young Miro'. She wasn't young Miro, and she wasn't the Miro who had lost her sanity while creating Ari.

Miro gave a faint smile, one she had never shown in this place. 

"It's funny. My daughter is surprised to see her mother in her right mind."

“…Nice to meet you, Mother."

"Come here."

“…”

“Are you not coming?”

Ari couldn't refuse and walked over. Miro grabbed Ari's face with both hands and looked at her for a while, as if observing her. 

"You haven't found the 'Mirror Room' yet, have you?"

“No.”

“Be careful when you find it. It's a much more dangerous place than you think.”

“Wait! Tell me more. What is dangerous about it?"

"Gain, sticking a cherry on your nose was pretty cool.”

“…You remember what happened during the first attempt, don't you?"

"It's strange hearing you use honorifics to me. It's one of the things I dislike about Korean. I can't tell you much about the Mirror Room. You haven't found it yet. My advice to you would be..."

Miro seemed to be thinking for a moment, then she spoke again. 

“I wanted to achieve many goals in that place, but I lost everything as a result.”

“Excuse me?”

Instead of answering more about the Mirror Room, Miro changed the subject. “Ah… To think I'd be able to get another chance at the hotel! I really didn't know."

"That's uncertain."

"Ho! That's right. Ultimately, it's up to you whether you use the ticket. But you'll eventually meet me again."

"How are you so sure?"

Instead of answering immediately, Miro smiled slightly. Did she have grounds for her confidence?

“Our blessings aren't given for no reason. You already know that, right?”

“It's given to the right person. Actually, I think I chose it."

“I received 'Justice'. What does this mean?”

“…”

“You must have heard a lot of bad things about me. I don't plan to deny them. But I can say one thing for sure.”

“What are you - ”

“I've always wanted to save the world. Even if it meant staining my hands with blood!”

An inexplicable fire flared up in Miro's eyes. After the nostalgic smile before, now her eyes burned with passion. 

I finally realized it deep down. This woman is different from the regressed girl Ari knows, and she's different from the innocent girl who was with us in this hell until now. 

This is someone who has traversed countless hells that Earth could not understand, over an immeasurable period of time, and has formed a mind as deep as an abyss. 

The blessing is given to the right person. This is something the 'Lucky Patron' already told us. From what I've learned over the past few months, Elena's justice, the current holder of justice, is similar to 'law'.

Then, what was Miro's justice when she was in her right mind? What kind of event happened in the world that forced Miro to stain her hands with blood to save it?

The world that had stopped began to collapse again. Miro looked around blankly.

“Thank you.”

“Excuse me?”

“Pain. Tragedy. Trauma. There was a time when I believed that you become accustomed to these things after experiencing them repeatedly. No matter how painful the memories, I thought that if they repeated over and over again, they would eventually feel insignificant."

“…”

"But it's not true. On Christmas Day, all my friends and teachers I loved died. I was the only one who was hiding among the corpses, and I was rescued by the Administration."

"You experienced something terrible."

"I thought it was just a distant past. But after falling into 'hell', I realized. I never overcame that pain. I just believed I had buried it in the depths of oblivion and forced myself to forget. This hell is not a place where you can get used to things with time…”

“…You suffered."

“Thank you. I'm serious. And if you revive me someday, I'll have to choose one of the inheritances I had before.”

“I've heard something like that would happen."

"I'm telling you this because my mind might not be right at that time. If I'm struggling with what to choose, tell me without fail. Choose the 'Clock'."

'Clock'.

In the final moment, Miro looked at Ari and grinned. 

“I love you!” 

Then the hell collapsed.
