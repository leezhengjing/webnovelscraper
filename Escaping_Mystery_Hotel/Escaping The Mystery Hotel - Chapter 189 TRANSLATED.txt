## Chapter 188 – Prayer for the Maze (7)

**Date:** Day 93
**Current Location:** Hell of the Maze
**Sage's Advice:** 3

— I explained to Grandpa, who was wondering why I had stopped, the realization I had come to. "The Santa that appeared earlier wasn't real. It was just an illusion." As I pointed to the clean, unblemished snow, Grandpa understood right away. "There's not a single footprint. Is that Santa a master of the Unsteppable Footprint?" "Yes?" "...Just a random thought. It felt so real that it's hard to believe it was an illusion." "It's not just about the footprints. There was no 'presence'. When a person moves, there's naturally the sound of their clothes rubbing together, their limbs bending, and so on. I didn't feel any of that at all." Ari, who had already sent the Maze back and returned, showed a reaction of wonder. "The sound of clothes rubbing together... your ears are that good? It was amazing earlier too. Even with Christmas carols playing everywhere, how did you hear the reindeer's breath 10 meters away? Are you a rabbit?" I had no answer. Even I found it difficult to understand my senses that had picked up the reindeer's breath amidst the carols. Ari simply said, "Your ears are good," but the sensation back then was not simply about being sharp of hearing. The moment I picked up the subtle feeling of something being off, all my senses focused on the minute sound, as if I was feeling my own heartbeat in a silent room—it was a strange memory. It felt like I had experienced something similar a few times…

As my thoughts wandered, the group who had returned to school with me led me to the back of the school where I had become aware. "Earlier, no, yesterday? Anyway, it's the same as yesterday. To my eyes, it's just a pile of garbage." "Actually, it's garbage now. It's an unconsciousness that's been completed, I don't know when." "Why are you back? To destroy it?" "That's one purpose, and before that, I'm seeing if there's something to figure out." "Should we try using the advice? You know—" "That when there's not enough information, you get an absurd answer? I know, but still, let's try it." After some thought, I chose the appropriate question. "Is there any information to figure out from this unconsciousness?" "..." "What's that look? An odd answer?" "It's already finished. Whether you destroy it now or not doesn't seem to matter much. And it's saying to walk six steps forward?" "Then, walk." "...If I walk forward, I'll end up destroying all these ruins?" "The Owl said it was an unconsciousness that's already finished, right? It should be fine to destroy it." I walked as instructed. One step, two steps, and six step— *Thud!* "What's this?" The moment my shoe touched it, something with a clear form hit my foot as if the pile of garbage was collapsing like sand. It was a small iron plate with strange lettering engraved on it. "It's written in English, so it must be some magical inscription." Ari looked completely clueless. "A reward for a good boy and a punishment for a bad boy. It's a phrase a slightly insane Santa would like. So what?" "We have to try the advice again." Grandpa, who was behind us, advised. "Don't ask about the unconsciousness, ask about Santa himself. It seems the unconsciousness itself is long finished, so it doesn't have much meaning now. It would be a waste to ask about a meaningless unconsciousness." "It's unsettling to use the advice before a fight, but there won't be a fight before midnight, right?" "It will. It's obvious that Santa will come again at midnight, and your advice will be accurate then, so don't worry and go ahead and use it." Ari had a different opinion. "Just in case, let's leave one. We might have other questions later, and we can't be sure if all the dangers have been revealed in the first attempt. What if a man-eating reindeer suddenly appears and goes 'Kya-ung' on the way back?" "Kya-ung?" "Kya-ung!" Let's leave one just in case. Maybe another moment will come when we need it. "Give me a hint about how to appropriately deal with Santa." ...Instantly, I went speechless.  When I conveyed the content, Ari and Grandpa also opened their mouths slightly. It's an obvious thing when you think about it, but I've been unconsciously overlooking it. This place isn't a cursed room! There's a high possibility that the way to solve it will also be different from a cursed room. Ari mumbled, seemingly flustered. "No, I get what you mean. Since it's not a cursed room, we'll need a different approach." "That 'different approach' seems to be the next line. 'Those who have fallen into hell must save themselves.'  This is quite a detailed answer even for the Owl." "I understand that too. Because Gain, as you said, gave an unusually clear sentence for the Owl. It means the Maze is the one who fell into hell and the Maze has to save himself.  Of course, Maze can't do it alone, we have to help him, but..." Grandpa summed up everyone's worries at once. "So what does it mean? Are you telling Maze to beat up Santa?" "It doesn't seem like that kind of method, unless Maze has a few more hidden superpowers." "This is getting more and more complicated. At first, we thought we had to catch Santa before Christmas, but Santa was just an illusion before Christmas, so it failed. Next, we thought we had to destroy the unconsciousness, but the unconsciousness is already finished, leaving only the ruins, so that failed. In the end, it's confirmed that Santa will appear on Christmas and go wild, right?" Looking at the current information, it's not a wrong statement. We haven't found a way to stop Santa from appearing on Christmas. In the end, we have to stop him after he appears. In the midst of the confused atmosphere, I checked the time and realized that it was already past 7 o'clock. "There are less than 5 hours left until Santa appears." "..." "Let's act based on the information we've gathered, instead of thinking and worrying." "What are you talking about? We haven't found anything at all, so what are we supposed to do?" "Why not? We realized an important fact. It's saying to involve the Maze." "Ah?" "This." "Huh?" "Take this too. Maybe Maze will understand." The strange piece of metal found in the center of the unconsciousness, and a phrase that Santa would probably like. 'A reward for a good boy and a punishment for a bad boy.' 

Midnight is not far off. My heart was starting to race. I was lost in thought, wondering what to explain to Maze and how. ...An idea popped into my head. Why does Santa come to school? To give presents. *Soon, it'll be time for Santa to appear. The atmosphere on the first floor was quite different from yesterday. Yesterday, the kids were full of anticipation for Santa coming with presents, but today, they all had excited expressions, thinking they were going to play a 'fun prank'. Will it work as planned? I definitely felt that 'this direction' was the answer. There's no way to stop Santa from appearing. Santa is a difficult being who is extremely hard to deal with by force. Lastly, Maze must save himself from this hell. After combining all these factors, I came to the conclusion that I have to somehow cleverly break this bizarre situation of 'Santa the Demon of Christmas Appearing' in a way that doesn't involve fighting Santa.  "Gain, Gain, Gain, Gain!" "Maze? What's wrong?" "...Will it work? I'm a little scared." Most of the boys and girls on the first floor are simply understanding the current situation as a fun prank. It's impossible to proceed with the plan properly if the kids start fearing Santa, so I had no choice but to lie.  Because I had convinced Maze, who had absolute influence among the children, I was able to control things to this extent.  And, Maze, the only girl on the first floor who vaguely understood the current situation, couldn't hide her anxiety.  "It will be fine."  If it doesn't work, we'll just have to try again. "It's just... too weird!  Santa is suddenly going to kill us all?" To convince Maze, I used today's final advice. The Owl had told me that when it comes to convincing someone about the existence of supernatural phenomena, it's most effective to directly show them your abilities once, rather than using a thousand words. Maze had reacted with 'You're crazy?' when I talked for 30 minutes, but she was convinced after just one 'instantaneous movement'.  I slightly shook the pen again and wrote 'Don't worry' in Maze's field of vision, and Maze calmed down.  ...Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way. Oh! what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh.  The carols played. It was ironic that I had just told Maze not to worry, but deep down, I was overwhelmed with fear that was too much to bear.  — *Bang!*  Santa entered. At the same time, the children shouted. "Merry Christmas!" Santa's eyes widened, then he burst into a wide smile and shouted. "Merry Christmas! Thank you all so much! It seems like there are a lot of good children here. I'm truly happy. But." Santa's mouth split 'vertically'. The children at the back thought they had seen something wrong and didn't react much, but I could feel the startled expressions of the children in the front row. "But, only good children can receive Christmas presents. We can't know if you're all good, right? So—"  At that moment, Maze stood up. "Santa! We already got our presents!  Hey everyone!"  As she said those words, the children took out the boxes they had been hiding behind their backs. Various gifts that the teachers at the school had frantically searched for during the past few hours emerged from the boxes! For the first time since entering Maze's hell, Santa's face contorted with confusion. Now is the time for the final blow. "Hey! Who are you? Our kids already got their presents from me, you're too late, aren't you?" A kind old man with a warm red outfit, a huge bag of presents in one hand, a much kinder look than the Santa monster with a vertically split mouth.  The Old Man Santa appeared.
