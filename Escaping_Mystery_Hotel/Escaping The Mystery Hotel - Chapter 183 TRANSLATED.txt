## Chapter 182 – Prayer for the Maze (1)

**Date:** 92nd Day
**Current Location:** Layer 2, Frozen Hell – Resurrection Chamber
**Wise Man’s Advice:** 3

A maze suddenly appeared before us, trapped in ice. Ari collapsed, completely stunned, and the rest of us just stared with our mouths agape, unsure of what to do. 

At that moment, a voice echoed from the sky. “Participants, welcome to Frozen Hell!” Welcome in this atmosphere? This was a ridiculous statement, so I raised my head in disbelief. The unidentified drone we had seen in the Gateway Chamber was there. “What are you?” “Participant Han Gain, I have been assigned the role of guiding you through Frozen Hell. Please call me the Guide.”

The appearance of the “Guide” finally brought our companions back to their senses, and they began to gather one by one. Songi supported Ari and brought her over. “Here… what are we supposed to do here? Why are we in this dreadful place -” Jincheol Hyung’s bewildered words were abruptly cut off by the mechanical voice. “Participants, please take out your tickets.”

My sister took out the ticket with a blank expression. “You can use this ticket to resurrect one person who has fallen into hell. Will you use it?”

Everyone was speechless. We all knew about Ari’s mother and the situation with the Maze. Wasn’t she a being who was insane but incredibly strong? If we resurrected the Maze immediately, there was no guarantee we could control her. Even Ari herself admitted this and agreed that it would be best not to resurrect her rashly until we found a way to restore her mind.

However, would Ari be able to answer the same way, even now, in front of the Maze, who was trapped in ice and suffering endlessly? Could we persuade her to leave her suffering mother and save someone else? We had eight mouths but no one had anything to say, and a frozen silence filled the room.

… The first to break the silence was my sister. “Can I ask some questions about the resurrection? I’ve always been curious about this.” “Ask.”

“As far as I know, Maze-yang owned numerous legacies in her lifetime.” “Former participant Maze possessed three legacies before her death.” “Really? If she’s resurrected, will she come back with all three of those legacies?” “If a former participant is resurrected, they can choose to recover only one legacy from the legacies they acquired during their lifetime. However, two people cannot obtain the same legacy. Therefore, if former participant Maze is resurrected, she can choose to recover one of the two legacies other than ‘Ancient Blood’ from the three legacies she acquired during her lifetime.”

If a former participant who acquired multiple legacies is resurrected, they can only recover one of those legacies. Also, since the same legacy cannot be given to two people, Maze cannot recover ‘Ancient Blood’. The next question followed immediately.

“What about her blessing? I’m not sure, but Maze-yang’s blessing was…” My sister mumbled, glancing at Elena. “Since participant Elena Ivanova, who has already received the blessing of Justice, exists, former participant Maze cannot recover the blessing of Justice. However, the hotel’s principle is that participants must be given a blessing, so a new blessing will be assigned.”

It’s a simple story in summary. If Maze is resurrected, she will have one legacy and a new blessing. Since it’s a new blessing, it will not be at all developed. 

When I thought this far, an idea came to mind. If Maze’s power is that level, wouldn’t it be enough for our party to handle? Jincheol Hyung, who had a similar thought, immediately opened his mouth. “Ahem. I feel like things are suddenly getting urgent, but it seems like the situation is a bit different from when we discussed it before. At that time, we put Maze-yang’s resurrection on the back burner because she was too strong, right? The core of that strength was the ‘multiple legacies.’” 

Songi, who was supporting Ari, agreed. “That’s right! But according to the Guide, she only has one legacy now, right? And her blessing is reset. In that case, Maze-yang wouldn’t be able to overwhelm us alone -”

My sister’s sharp voice cut through the room. “Wait. Wait. This isn’t a matter to be decided so impulsively. Maze’s power isn’t just her legacies. Did you all forget that she was a superhuman with superpowers even before she entered the hotel? Grandfather?”

My sister’s accusatory question made the grandfather lower his head and answer. “… That’s right. Maze was already a superhuman before entering the hotel. She had several abilities that were difficult to understand.”

“See. Don’t easily underestimate the danger just because the number of legacies has decreased. And in fact, there’s a more fundamental issue than the strength of her abilities. Guide!” “Participant Eun Sol, ask your question.” 

“I heard that Maze was insane before her death. Will her mind be restored after resurrection?” “The former participant’s mind will be resurrected in the same state it was in before death.” “So, there’s no chance of her mind being restored?” “That’s correct.”

My sister whipped her head around, and everyone fell silent again. My sister’s opinion that Maze’s danger is still extreme is persuasive. If she were a being with intelligence, even if her personality was a bit strong, it would be possible to cooperate for the common goal of escaping the hotel, but can we cooperate with someone who is originally insane? What if she starts acting childish and attacking our allies during the Cursed Chamber quest? Who will be able to handle that? Ari? What if Ari died during the Cursed Chamber quest? There is no answer. The more I thought about it, the more I realized there was no answer. No wonder even Ari, her daughter, said she didn’t plan on resurrecting her until they found a way to restore her mind.

… While my head was getting tangled, the voices around me began to rise. Someone pointed out that my sister’s words were too sharp, and my sister, in turn, said she was disappointed by their impulsive words, and even saw the grandfather stop them. It was chaotic. And it was painful. If the one trapped in the ice and suffering endlessly was my parent, how would I react? Wouldn’t I immediately descend and beat everyone up to free my mother from suffering? When I thought about that, I realized that Ari’s mental strength was extraordinary even in this chaotic situation.

… Come to think of it, I have an ability that helps me in such a complicated situation. “Is there a way to solve this situation wisely?” 

“Ah, you little punk! This isn’t an answer again! Are you serious?” “Did you use Advice?” Ari, who hadn’t said a word until now, asked me for the first time. “… Yes. It said to have a cup of coffee and relax. It said there’s an answer in your mind.” 

“Is that so?” Ari silently took out coffee from her backpack and offered it to me. “…” “Have some.” “Thanks.”

The harshness of hell, reminiscent of the polar regions, the song of suffering echoing throughout the world. In the midst of it all, my companions started arguing about the most pointless topic since entering the hotel, and I began to relax with a cup of coffee amidst this chaos. What in the world is going on? … “There’s an answer in your mind.” I recall the memory of the past. What did Dr. Kim Sanghyun, the doctor who first informed us about the existence of the “Resurrection Chamber,” say? “Someday… if you get a chance in the Resurrection Chamber, or if you meet Buddha…” 

The doctor mentioned “Buddha” in addition to the Resurrection Chamber as a way to save himself. “The Sponsor said that the matter of the cold is not my business.” “I heard that you don’t need to force yourself.” 

Elena and Seungyop received advice from their Sponsors that the matter of the cold was not their business. Information scattered in my mind gradually began to come together. What does all this information mean? There is another way to save NPCs who have failed in the hotel besides resurrection! Furthermore, we have something to “do” in this space. It’s not something Elena and Seungyop are suitable for, but something I need to do in coordination with experienced people. The Sponsors wouldn’t have given advice that we should use tickets to resurrect someone and be done with it, or that we don’t need to force ourselves. 

“Wait! Everyone, calm down and be quiet. Guide!” My voice burst out loud, and my companions stopped arguing. The drone hovering in the air turned towards me. “Participant Han Gain, ask your question.”

“What can we do here besides resurrection through tickets?” The Guide didn’t answer. 

“Why aren’t you answering? What can we do? Is there any other way to stop their suffering?” The first person to react to my words was the grandfather. “Come to think of it, this situation is strange. Isn’t it clearly a situation where they were going to make us do something grand before we came? Someone said not to step in, someone said to work with experienced people. So why are you suddenly talking about tickets now?”

My sister also approached. “Why isn’t he saying anything? Hey! Guide? Are you hiding something?”

Finally, Ari opened her mouth to everyone. “I guess he’s going with the ‘doesn’t lie’ concept.” 

“What concept?” “Doesn’t lie. But doesn’t tell the truth either. Isn’t this a drone with a concept like that? We seem to have to find some kind of ‘keyword’ and speak.”

As soon as I heard ‘keyword’, a word came to mind. “If it’s a keyword, then it must be ‘Buddha’? Guide. Should we pray to Buddha for former participant Maze?”

“I don’t think so. Guide. Can we just break the ice?”

“Stop trying to solve everything by breaking things. Guide. Can we buy Maze?” 

“… Eun Sol. That was even worse than breaking the ice… what are you trying to buy?” 

“Can’t we just shove someone else into hell instead? A merchant or something?”

“Why do you hate merchants so much, grandfather?”

Amidst the chaotic, nonsensical conversation, Seungyop said, “Guide, should we all pray together?”

— Wing! “Participants. Will you offer a ‘prayer of rest’ for former participant Maze to Buddha?”
