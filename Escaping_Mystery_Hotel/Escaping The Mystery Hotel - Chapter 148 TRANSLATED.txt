## Chapter 147 - Rest and Reorganization (3)

Immediately after the Hand of Greed was used, a familiar merchant appeared as if the surrounding space itself was echoing. When it was first used, a monster extermination event occurred, so this time I thought it would be another event that we’d solve through fighting. But it seems I was wrong. A different kind of event occurred. This time, is it a trade event? Everyone was somewhat taken aback and focused their attention on the merchant. 

The merchant, with his bandages flapping, began a long speech. “Good day to you, esteemed customers. I have come personally at the request of customer Eun-sol. The hotel is a rough and arduous place! Without powerful treasures or supernatural abilities, it’s a place you can’t survive, right? The desire to become stronger! I understand. I deeply sympathize. Of course, there’s no free lunch in this world! You know that, right?” 

Eun-sol said in a somewhat tired tone, “Just tell us quickly. What are you selling this time, and what will we have to pay for it?” 

“What am I selling? Oh, dear, dear! That’s a misunderstanding. I’m not here to sell anything this time.” 

“What do you mean?”

“I’m sorry, but the goods I’ve brought this time are precious items I can’t even dare to sell myself. Unfortunately, they can’t be taken outside the hotel.” 

“Can’t be taken outside the hotel? Are you saying you’re not selling them but lending them?”

“You’re quick-witted. That’s right. The goods I’m showing you this time can’t be taken outside the hotel. I will retrieve them immediately upon your departure. However, I will not refund the rental fee.”

The goods are ‘body parts’, and the rental fee. An ominous feeling arose. Just in case, I asked, “The rental fee… could it be, our original bodies?” 

The merchant didn’t answer, instead he opened his mouth wide enough for his lips to split. That was a sufficient answer. The merchant, as if growing increasingly amused, began his detailed explanation. 

“The goods are all specific body tissues! Those who wish can exchange them for their own real bodies and borrow them. Upon exiting the hotel, they will all be retrieved. In other words, you pay with your real body as the rental fee, and the borrowed body tissue will be retrieved upon your exit. Do you require further explanation?”

I understood perfectly. In short, it means you’ll be left with disabilities when you go outside. Everyone started making sounds as if they were suffocating. Grandfather Mook-sung asked, “Is treatment possible?”

“Impossible within the hotel! The real body you pay as the rental fee cannot be recovered even in room 105. It’s actually strange if it were to be recovered. If the borrowed body tissue is still there, and you recover your real body, wouldn’t you end up with three arms? However, you’ll have to figure it out outside the hotel. You might be able to recover through the power of wealth and medicine by getting a transplant.”

It’s a kind of loan transaction where you exchange your real body for a special body in exchange for your real body, and that borrowed body is also taken back when you leave the hotel.  Listening to it, I felt like it was bearable enough as long as that was the only price. For example, let’s say you give up one arm and gain an arm with immense strength. While you’re in the hotel, you have an arm with immense strength, so there’s no loss. Once you leave the hotel, wouldn’t there be some way to treat it? For example, if you ask for the help of the Management Bureau, I think they could somehow recover a missing arm. 

Ari, who had a similar thought, asked, “Why are the conditions so good, unlike your usual self? Is there no other price?”

The merchant answered with amusement, “Haha! This is all I’m taking. If I were to cheat you-”

… ? The merchant suddenly stopped talking. . . . Suddenly, the merchant’s mouth ripped open horizontally and vertically in a cross, revealing countless hidden teeth like saws! The merchant, who never lost his smile, even when we were attacking him, was now sporting a hideous expression comparable to a demon descended upon earth, sending chills down our spines. 

The merchant glared at Eun-sol and said, “Haha, my patron seems to want a ‘more friendly explanation’.”

Did Eun-sol’s patron intervene? She simply answered, “Tell him I’m grateful.” 

The merchant’s expression returned to a forced smile. Perhaps due to the pressure from his patron, he began a much more detailed explanation. “This kind of explanation is really boring, but I can’t help it. Strictly speaking, it’s hard to call it a price because I’m not receiving anything. However, there’s something else that might burden you from your point of view. It’s the burden itself that comes with the new body tissue. The human body is like a complex machine. Just because a certain part of the body has an abnormal strength doesn’t mean the burden is only on that part. A mutated arm will affect your entire upper body, and a mutated eye will affect your brain. And that burden also cannot be treated within the hotel.” 

The second price: the burden on the entire body.  From a certain perspective, isn’t this the real price?  The first price, the loss of the real body, is something you don’t need to worry about while you’re in the hotel, and you can solve it somehow outside the hotel. However, the second price, the burden on the entire body, cannot be treated within the hotel, so the recipient has no choice but to endure it. 

As everyone was thinking over this complex issue, the merchant began to show the goods in earnest. 

The first item was an arm covered in black, opaque scales. “This is the arm of a powerful warrior from the Abraus clan. It can generate three times the strength of an adult male, and its durability is enough to deflect blades. Its regenerative power will make even lizards jealous. In fact, having just this one arm can make everyone skilled warriors.”

The second item was a reverse-jointed leg covered in white fur. “This is the right leg of the master of Mount Esede. Its strength and intensity are incomparable to human legs.  If you use its spring-like muscles, you can run 20 meters, 30 meters in one leap. Most importantly, this is its extensibility! This leg can actually stretch or shrink according to the situation.” 

The third item was a large eyeball, almost the size of a fist. “This is the eye of the One-Eyed Kraken from Philote Island. It has incredible eyesight that can see a mayfly 100 meters away and read the words written on a flying arrow. This is just the beginning. This eye can actually capture the entire scene currently in its field of vision, just like a camera.  And even more amazing! It’s said to be able to dimly detect invisible beings that cannot be seen by human eyes.”

The last item was a spine. “This is the backbone of a Flocksian. This item-” 

Ari immediately cut him off. “Wait. The price of this bone is taking our spines, right?”

“That is correct.” 

Ari turned to us and said, “This is unacceptable. Even with the Management Bureau’s technology, there’s still no way to regenerate an entire spine. In the first place, if your spine disappears, you’ll probably die instantly as soon as you return to Earth, right? None of you want to die right after going outside?” 

I asked Ari, “Only this spine is met with this reaction? Can’t we recover the arm, leg, and eye?”

Ari nodded. “The eye isn’t regeneration, but a prosthetic, but we can mostly recover it.”

It seems we need to consider the remaining goods except the spine. The one who used the Hand of Greed, Eun-sol, was eagerly looking at all those items and started asking the merchant more detailed questions.  As I looked around, those who were interested and those who weren’t were clearly divided.  Generally, those who had reliable power even without those items, like the inheritor of wealth, Jin-cheol, Song-i, and Ari, seemed indifferent. To be honest, they didn’t look like amazing items compared to inheritance, and I thought that these items might hinder the free use of inheritance or blessings if they burdened the body. 

Seung-yeop was showing considerable interest, so I pulled him away.  This was something I had already discussed with Jin-cheol and Grandfather Mook-sung, but considering the blessing ‘Luck’, it seemed most appropriate for Seung-yeop to use the protective suit in normal situations. If he’s going to wear the protective suit anyway, then an abnormal body is of little significance. 

In the end, Elena, Grandfather Mook-sung, and Eun-sol started to discuss it enthusiastically. Grandfather Mook-sung was arguing passionately. “Everything but the eye is a trap! The arms and legs are nothing. Can’t you see? They’re just making you stronger, right? Jin-cheol has brute strength, Pero has it, and there are protective suits. There are many alternatives. However, overwhelming visual abilities! There are no alternatives for that.”

Eun-sol partly agreed and partly disagreed. “I agree that the eye is the best, but arms and legs aren’t bad either.  There are only three people interested anyway, so it seems like it would be better if we all got something - one person gets the eye, the other two get the arm and leg, so everyone gets something.”

Elena also chimed in. “I think the legs are definitely a trap.  An arm becoming strong on only one side might have some significance, but is it significant for only one leg to be strong?  Most actions that use legs, like running, jumping, and hopping, require balance from both legs.  Can you properly jump if only one leg is strong?” 

“Hm, the legs really do seem like a trap. Then, just the eye and the arm?” I also shared my thoughts. “It’s ultimately your choice, but I think it’s better if Elena doesn’t get anything.”

Elena looked at me with curiosity.  To be precise, she looked at my feet.  It’s still awkward for me to make eye contact. “These body tissues seem useful, but they’re not comparable to inheritance or the power of blessings. Therefore, it would be problematic if these items hindered the operation of inheritance or blessings. Isn’t it a case of seeking small gains and losing big ones? From that perspective, Eun-sol’s ‘Wealth’ or Grandfather Mook-sung’s ‘Communication’ seem fine because the blessings are unrelated to the body. Even if those body tissues burden your body, Wealth or Communication wouldn’t be significantly affected. On the other hand, Elena, remember what happened in the past? The injuries you suffered before Justice Activation couldn’t be healed even after Activation. Didn’t you confirm that because of those injuries, you could collapse or be incapacitated even after using Justice?”

Elena understood what I was saying. “If I use these new body tissues and accumulate damage to my body, that damage could cause me to collapse even while using Justice. Then I’ll give up.”

In the end, it was decided that Eun-sol would get the eye and Grandfather Mook-sung would get the arm. The two of them approached the merchant. 

Eun-sol, standing before the merchant, asked somewhat fearfully, “I’ll take the eye, and this old man here will take the arm.  But how are you going to give them to us? You’re not going to actually take my eye and this old man’s arm, are you?”

“Goodness! Who would do such a barbaric act? Are you barbarians?  Taking an eye and an arm without anesthesia! People die from that, you know. Shock death! You understand?”

“…” That bastard, wasn’t he telling us to cut off our fingers and limbs as payment last time we met? 

“Don’t worry. We will attach the goods to you without pain while you’re sleeping. Just in case, please don’t grit your teeth and resist while you’re sleeping. It’ll just cause trouble for everyone.”

The loan transaction was concluded.  The merchant put away the rejected body parts, showed the arm and eyeball to us once more, and then disappeared. 

… It should be considered the price for gaining powerful strength, but both body parts are too different in appearance from human arms and eyes. Especially the eyeball, judging by its size, it’s doubtful whether it’s the right size to fit in a human skull.  I think Elena’s quick abandonment of the leg was also influenced by its outward ugliness.  If that’s the case, then the determination of those who were willing to accept that ugliness to obtain the eye and the arm is extraordinary.  It was a matter of course, but I looked at my sister and grandfather once again.
