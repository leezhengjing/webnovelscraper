## Chapter 152 – Room 201, The Cursed Room – ‘□ □□’ (1) – Kim Ari

“Team Leader Elizabeth, this is the Hesbert Mansion.”

“Hmm.  So it’s true that over one hundred people have already lost their lives in this place?”

“At this rate, it will reach four digits by next year.”

“That’s why we’re here. Let’s go in.”

— Clunk! 

“What was that sound?”

“Team Leader Elizabeth! The door is locked!”

“What the hell is going on? Contact headquarters!”

“What? What’s happening? The signal is gone!”

— Beep beep beep!

After entering the Hesbert Mansion, I regained consciousness along with a beeping sound echoing in my mind. Everyone else began to open their eyes and look around.  As expected, Gaini was sealed. Seven people were visible, excluding Gaini. A dizzying amount of information was being poured into my brain in real time.  Surrounding me were familiar colleagues and two unfamiliar individuals.  Suddenly, seven people started struggling, and the two NPCs looked back at us in confusion.

“What’s wrong with everyone? Are you alright?” 

This man’s name is… I remembered. Oliver, an agent. 

“Have the mansion’s anomalies already begun? I can’t feel anything yet.”

This woman’s name is… I remembered. Elizabeth, also an agent, and the leader of this team. First, I need to handle the situation.

“I suddenly heard a strong beeping sound in my head. I think those close to the entrance probably heard it.”

“Is that so? Agent Ari, are you alright?”

“I’m fine, Oliver. Elizabeth! Give us a little break.”

“Okay. There are plenty of chairs, so let’s take a break.”

Soon, my colleagues also regained consciousness. There were two mysterious NPCs around us.  Finally, we started using the chat window.

**Lee Eun-sol**: What’s this I’m wearing?

**Kim Mook-sung**: Bulletproof, stab-proof armor.

**Park Seung-yeop**: Is this a real gun?

**Kim Ari**: Yes. Put the barrel down, it’s scary.

**Cha Jin-cheol**: Are we playing special forces agents?

**Kim Mook-sung**: Attention! We are all agents of the Management Bureau in this stage.

**Kim Ari**: Anomalies are occurring in this mansion. There have been numerous casualties. We are here to take care of them.

It seems like our colleagues are gradually understanding the situation.  Ironically, we have become Management Bureau agents in this stage.  The highest ranking person among us is the team leader, Elizabeth.  The only drawback is that we are already inside the mansion.  If we had regained consciousness earlier, we would have sent one person away in a car for ‘escape route’ purposes…  It’s probably a measure to prevent trickery.  We entered the mansion, and after the door was locked, we woke up. 

As we slowly began to regain consciousness, Elizabeth and Oliver approached from the other side. It would be more comfortable if it were just us.  Why are these NPCs here?  There has to be a reason.  The chat window became noisy again.

**Kim Mook-sung**: Ari, stall those guys for a bit.

**Kim Ari**: ?

**Kim Mook-sung**: Look at that guy’s face, Seung-yeop!

I looked over, curious what he was talking about. Seung-yeop was inspecting the gun with the barrel pointed at his eye, looking fascinated. My head suddenly started to ache.  Mook-sung seemed to be trying to give Seung-yeop and Song-yi some basic firearms training. What the hell was the hotel doing handing these kids assault rifles?  It’s ominous.  I’ve experienced the Cursed Room many times, but the hotel has never provided such flashy equipment as “assault rifles” or “bulletproof, stab-proof armor.”  There’s no reason to give out such powerful equipment meaninglessly. It feels like we will be facing a fierce battle in this trial.

I suggested to Elizabeth and Oliver that we try to find a way to contact the outside world and stalled for time.  After about 30 minutes, while searching for a way to escape, I took the opportunity to also examine the mansion’s structure. Although it was called a “mansion,” it was about the size of a slightly luxurious rich person’s house.  It was far from the ridiculous size of the previous haunted mansions, where we thought, ‘How can a mansion like this exist in Korea?’.  The interior was clean, and there were four rooms inside. The living room and study were also elegant.  There were two ways to exit – the front door and the back door – but both were locked.  There were no other findings. There was no way to go outside.  The doors were completely locked.  Even Jin-cheol’s incredible strength couldn’t budge them. The walkie-talkies were dead.  I checked to see if we could escape by breaking a window, but this mansion didn’t have any windows.  It seems like the 7 party members and the 2 NPCs need to thoroughly investigate this mansion. Should I try to stall for more time?  I glanced at Mook-sung for a moment. Naturally, he had only taught them the basics, like “the trigger is here, and make sure the barrel isn’t pointed at anyone.” At this rate, Seung-yeop, Song-yi, and Eun-sol won’t be able to handle the guns properly. Jin-cheol is fine since he’s been in the military, but surprisingly, Elena seems to understand quickly as well.  Has she had experience handling guns?  Or maybe she has a natural aptitude for this?  I don’t know.  No matter what, I need to buy more time for the three gun novices –

“Ugh!”

“Oliver? What the hell is that?”

“This, look at this!”

I followed Oliver’s frantic gaze to a large, unnatural-looking mirror hanging on the wall.  Bright blood-red letters appeared.

Go down.

The meaning was clear.  It means to move now.  Looking back at my experience in the hotel, if I don’t go down and persevere, ‘discipline’ will begin soon.  There’s nothing I can do. Mook-sung also sighed and began to move with everyone else. But it didn’t say to go to the front door or the back door… ‘down’?  Is there a way down?

Elizabeth, who was looking around with a similar thought, discovered something.

“Everyone, this way!”

Elizabeth opened the door I had mistaken for the third room’s door. Behind the door was a staircase leading downwards.

The chat window flickered.

**Kim Mook-sung**: It’s ominous that we’re following orders.  Should we go down?

**Kim Ari**: Any other ideas? There’s no way out of the mansion.

**Lee Eun-sol**: Let’s go down for now.

Through the staircase behind the door, we went down a short distance into what looked like a passageway.  What else is down here in the mansion?  Before my colleagues could even express their bewilderment, a clunking sound echoed.  This sound? It’s the sound I heard when we first entered the mansion!  Jin-cheol was the first to react.

“I heard that sound earlier, and then the door locked!”

Jin-cheol quickly turned around and went back to the place where we first started. Or rather, he tried to go back.  After a brief sound of exertion, Jin-cheol returned and told everyone.

“The entrance is blocked. We can’t go back now.”

When we first entered the mansion, the door locked, preventing us from going outside. When we entered the underground passageway, the entrance to the passageway locked, preventing us from going back to the mansion.  A repetitive phenomenon.  We can’t go back. There is only forward.  Regardless, we can’t stay in the underground passageway forever.  We had no choice but to go straight through and come out. 

As soon as we exited the passageway, we were dumbfounded.

“This is…?”

“Did we accidentally go the wrong way and walk backward?  We only went straight, right?”

After walking a considerable distance through the mansion’s underground passageway, we returned to the front door of the mansion.  Does that make sense?  But there’s no other explanation. We were bewildered to find ourselves back in the Hesbert Mansion.  But we had already taken a look at the mansion, so there was no need to examine it again.  I glanced at the familiar wallpaper, flower pots, TV, dining table, and pottery. The suffocating interior without windows was an added bonus.

Elizabeth, who was surveying the surroundings, tilted her head and gave us instructions.

“Let’s go to the living room.”

I also moved towards the living room and looked around.  The fluffy carpet near the living room – ?  Did the carpet pile get a little longer? As I tilted my head for a moment, Oliver, who had searched the mansion with me earlier, also felt something strange.

“The design seems slightly different, doesn’t it?”

Oliver gently placed his foot on the carpet. 

“My observation skills are quite sharp, but earlier, my foot didn’t sink in like this – ”

— Slap! 

A dark hand popped out from under the carpet and grabbed Oliver’s foot!

“Grandma said that you shouldn’t step on the carpet with your shoes on!”

In an instant, Oliver was dragged ‘under’ the carpet. There’s no way an adult male could fit under a carpet! It was as if Oliver had seeped through the space between the carpet and the floor, disappearing.  Everyone was caught off guard by the sudden tragedy.

“Aaah! Ugh!”

A scream echoed.  A very terrible and painful scream.

— Crack!  Creak!  Squeal!

The sound of someone’s body being ripped apart and dismembered echoed throughout the mansion.

Ten minutes, maybe more.  Oliver’s screams continued, piercing our ears.

…  We were all speechless in the face of such a unimaginable tragedy.  After the surroundings finally quieted down, the chat window flickered.

**Yoo Song-yi**: What the hell happened? We went down into the mansion’s basement and returned to the mansion’s entrance?

**Lee Eun-sol**: Is it a cyclic structure? A mansion with a connection between the basement and the entrance?

**Elena**: It’s frustrating not even knowing the name of this room!

I agree.  It suddenly occurred to me, but we had taken it for granted that every time we started the Cursed Room, Gaini’s status window would show us the name of the room.  We don’t even know the name of the room.  Obviously, we have no understanding of the scenario.  Of course, there’s no way to ask for advice. We’ve been thrown into this bizarre murder mansion with absolutely no information.

I was about to type in the chat window, but I changed my mind.  Elizabeth needs to hear this too.

“Everyone, pay attention. If we stay still, we’ll probably get another instruction to move from the mirror.  If we decide to move, we need to think about where we’re going. There are three paths in this mansion. The front door, the back door, and the basement.”

Mook-sung added his opinion.

“Actually, it’s down to one now, right? We went down into the basement and came back to the front door.  The basement and the front door seem connected.  It’s a useless route.  Only the back door remains.”

Elizabeth chimed in.

“Then let’s go to the back door.”

It seems like the back door is the only remaining option.  Should we go to the back door?  It’s confusing!  Hints would be helpful in situations like this.  There are times when I miss that clumsy guy. Let’s stay calm.  We don’t have what we don’t have, and we need to think based on what we have.  Wasn’t the concept of the second floor’s ‘sealing’ to target parties that were overly reliant on specific individuals or specific abilities?  We lack information and don’t know where to go.  If ‘wisdom’ is the power that helps us make the right decision based on the given information in this state…  Well, there’s a way to choose the correct answer without that power.

“Seung-yeop. Where do you think we should go?”

Before I could finish, Seung-yeop swayed and bumped into the chair next to him, falling over.  His outstretched hand instinctively pointed towards the front door, where we came in.

“Oops! I, I’m sorry. This armor is making my body swell up suddenly, so I keep bumping into things – ”

“No, you’re right.”

That’s it.  I think I know now. The lucky choice has already been made.  If Seung-yeop thinks about it and chooses, that would be wrong.

“Let’s go to the front door.”

Mook-sung looked confused at my words.

“We just came through the front door, right?  Since the basement and the front door are connected, wouldn’t we just go back through the basement?”

Even Elizabeth was speechless.

“Did you forget that the entrance to the underground passageway was locked? If we go back to the front door and retrace our steps through the underground passageway, we’ll just end up back at the locked entrance.”

I think I’m getting it now.

“Think about it and just go back to the front door.  To be honest, doesn’t it seem a bit strange that the front door and the basement are connected?  How did we originally enter the mansion?”

It’s the front door, of course.  When we first entered, the front door was naturally connected to the outside.  However, after entering the mansion, the front door and the basement became connected.  This mansion’s space is distorted.  Mook-sung, who had grasped that, paused for a moment.

In the end, everyone decided to go back to the front door as I suggested.  Elizabeth grumbled that it didn’t make sense to go to the back door, but she didn’t oppose the majority opinion.

* We went through the same process again. When we opened the front door, the underground passageway appeared again. When everyone entered the underground passageway, the door clunked shut, blocking the path back to our original location.  As we walked straight through the underground passageway, the door that had been locked earlier was now open. 

… No, not really.  According to my logic, it wasn’t the door that was locked earlier that opened this time.  This door is the one we first found. We opened the door and entered the ‘third’ mansion. There are countless mansions in this bizarre world.

Next Chapter.
