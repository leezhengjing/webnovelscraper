## Chapter 187 – A Prayer for the Maze (6)

**Date:** 93rd Day

**Current Location:** Ice Hell – Resurrection Chamber

**Sage’s Advice:** 3


When I regained consciousness amidst the dizzying sensations, we were standing outside the door. Checking the status window, I realized that time had passed.

“Ugh, I never would have thought that Santa would be the culprit. Are you okay?” My grandfather, who had been holding his head as if he had a headache, replied.

“That Santa guy was really tough. He kept using all sorts of magic while singing, there was just no way to deal with him. Are you alright, Ari?”

“I'm fine. Ugh... I should have known something was wrong when I heard those Christmas carols!”

Just then, Eun-sol walked over from the opposite side.

“From the sound of it, you didn't succeed?”

“It seems like we’ll have to go back in again. Let’s take a breather first –”

“Sorry, but we need to go back in right now.”

“What?”

“I’m sorry. But the situation on our side isn’t as good as we thought. We need to save as much time as possible.”

What does that mean? Our side? Shouldn’t the prayer team just be sitting around?

Unlike me, who was baffled and about to ask something, Ari acted quickly.

“I guess they have their own struggles over there. Let’s go back immediately. Let's have the meeting there. We have plenty of time before Santa goes wild anyway.”

“... Be careful everyone. I'll try my best to solve this as quickly as possible.”

We immediately returned to the maze's hell.


* Right after the "Hell Team" returned to the maze's hell following Eun-sol's instructions, Cha Jin-chul came running from afar after checking the situation on the first floor.

“Sis! How did it go?”

“It seems like the first attempt failed. They have to try again.”

“I see.”

“What about Seung-yeop and Song-i?”

“They’re just barely hanging on. I wrapped them up in sleeping bags and blankets.”

“The weather is too harsh. I never imagined that ‘Fragrance of Rest’ would be something that burns a person’s energy.”

“The first floor is a mess. It’s just another hell like the second floor. The door to room 105 is completely locked. How is Elena?”

“It's been about three hours since she went in. It's going to get rough. I'll go in next.”

“…”

“Take this.”

“This is…”

“Maybe it’ll help us out.”

Cha Jin-chul held a piece of white paper in his hand: ‘3-Day Rest Voucher’.

We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy New Year!

As the carol rang out in ‘English,’ I realized something. Since this place is an American school, everyone from the students to the teachers must have spoken English in real history. The hotel conveniently translated all the dialogue into Korean. The only exceptions were words that, like the maze’s ‘imbued words,’ contained supernatural power. Why would only the carols be constantly in English? It was a clear warning that the carols themselves contained something supernatural!

Immediately after waking up from the maze’s hell, I rushed to the faculty room where Ari and my grandfather were.

“Have you given it any thought?”

“About how to deal with Santa? This guy is really not easy.”

“In the original history, the Management Bureau would have taken care of him, right? The maze would have been lucky to survive.”

“That’s probably right. The Management Bureau would have had a way to kill him with firepower, whether they used a helicopter or a missile. But we need to find another way. We can’t even get in touch with the Management Bureau.”

Ari nodded.

“I don’t know if the hotel didn’t implement the Management Bureau within the maze’s hell or if there’s just no way for us to contact them, but the conclusion is the same. We’re on our own.”

“Let's share any weaknesses we’ve thought of. What I’ve confirmed is that he’s docile before ‘Christmas.’ As you know, Santa was already around before Christmas. Maybe he’s already here now!”

During my first attempt, I encountered Santa while having a snowball fight with the maze.

“That’s a definite key point. Perhaps the answer is to kill him now, before Christmas.”

Ari also spoke up.

“The weakness I noticed is that he has to sing carols before using his powers. There’s a kind of ‘preparation time’ required for all his techniques.”

“It seems like he had to sing the corresponding carol for every technique, like the blizzard, summoning the man-eating reindeer, head-bursting, etc., right?”

After pondering for a moment, my grandfather replied.

“His main body itself didn't feel extremely physically powerful. You may recall this, but when I punched him with the arm I got from the merchant, he flew away weakly.”

“But didn’t he get back up immediately after flying away? He was fine even after being shot, wasn’t he?”

My grandfather thought for a moment before answering.

“I think my judgment is more accurate since I saw him up close. Both my punch and the bullets didn’t feel like they didn’t work. It’s just that they weren’t enough. What if we set his whole body on fire?”

Ari quickly consolidated the ideas.

“His main body isn’t that strong, and he uses ‘carols’ like incantations to activate his magic, right? What if we hold him down with Muk-seong's strength, shut his mouth, and burn him?”

The idea was pretty good for something we came up with in a short time. His main body isn’t physically powerful, and he’s a monster who mumbles something to use his magic. In other words, isn’t he a kind of magician? We’ll shut his mouth before he uses his incantation and burn him. It’s a plan that takes Santa’s abilities into account.

After laying out a detailed plan for about 30 minutes, we began to wait for Santa to appear.


* During the first attempt, Santa appeared on the playground with his reindeer around 6 or 7 p.m. We still don’t know the exact conditions for his appearance. Therefore, we decided to create a situation as similar as possible to that time. In simpler terms, I’m currently having a snowball fight with the kids.

— Thwack!

“Spinning Whirlwind Shot!”

“…”

“Yaaah!”

Ever since I met Ari, I’ve always felt this way, but she’s really good at everything. Not to mention her studies, her physical abilities are also beyond ordinary people. Now that her ‘Ancient Blood’ is gone, she’s lost the superhuman aspects like her unique strength, but her natural talent hasn’t disappeared.

“How do you make it go straight to their heads every time you throw it?”

“Aim for their heads.”

“... That’s a good idea.”

— Thwack!

A snowball flying in from the side hit my cheek. Ari chuckled at it, and Miro and the other kids giggled from afar. Everyone’s laughing happily except for me who got hit in the face – happy ending?

We wish you a merry Christmas

While blankly standing there and listening to the carols, I realized time was running out. I subtly signaled Ari.

Han Ga-in: Time’s almost up.
Kim Ari: Should we send the kids in?

Unless we know the exact conditions for Santa’s appearance, we need to maintain a situation similar to the first attempt.

Han Ga-in: Everyone except Miro.

Soon, Ari and my grandfather, who had been watching us from nearby, let the kids inside. Is there a way to keep just Miro? Luckily, this problem was easily solved. As my grandfather started sending the kids in, Miro grabbed Ari’s arm and hid behind the car. My grandfather, naturally not seeing them, moved to prepare to deal with Santa.

Han Ga-in: Keep Miro with you. It’s time to wait.

… …

— Whoosh!

A chilling breath, like a tickle in my ear! I opened my eyes wide and turned my head towards the sound. I realized that I was the only one who heard it. Ari and my grandfather hadn’t reacted at all. They only looked towards the source of the sound after noticing my tense expression.

Soon, reindeer appeared from the forest.

— Whoosh. Whoosh. Plop.

The reindeer that had been ripping apart people’s heads a few hours ago was now walking gracefully and gently on the snow, like a genuinely kind animal.

“…He’s so graceful now.”

“Ha ha! Boy, you have discerning eyes. That child, despite his appearance, is truly sensitive and graceful.”

Santa appeared! He’s using the same method of appearing as last time. While everyone’s attention is on the deer, he suddenly appears from behind, as if by teleportation.

“Oh? Are you Santa Claus?”

“That’s right! What’s your name, kid?”

“My name is Han Ga-in. And those kids coming from over there are Miro and Ari.”

… Something’s strange. I realize a fact I didn’t notice the first time.

“Yes, yes. This is a good time. But Ga-in?”

“Yes?”

“Are you a good kid?”

Suddenly, only this sentence was spoken in English. What does it mean? Does this sentence contain magical power? While pondering, the chat window became noisy.

Kim Muk-seong: I’ll shut that guy’s mouth –
Han Ga-in: Stop
Kim Ari: ?
Kim Muk-seong: ?
Han Ga-in: It’s useless. It’s useless now.

Was it because I didn’t answer Santa’s question while focusing on the chat window? The old man looked annoyed.

“Kid, you should answer when an adult asks a question. I’m starting to doubt whether you’re a good kid.”

“I apologize. I was thinking about whether I’m a good kid, so I didn’t answer.”

“... That’s fine. It seems like you’re troubled about whether you’re a good kid. It’s good enough that you’re thinking about it.”

“Thank you.”

“There’s no such thing as a completely good person in the world. Everyone makes mistakes and gets dirty as they live. So think about it, think about it again. Think about what you’ve done wrong, and keep repenting. As you continue to do so, someday you’ll become a pure person like this beautiful, pristine snow.”

I was struggling to hold back a snicker. Just listening to him talk, you’d think he’s a child education expert. Who was that being that massacred kids earlier?

“I will always think about it.”

“Yes! Now, Ga-in, what do you want for Christmas? Only you and Ari haven’t written down what you want, so I’m worried.”

“Um…”

“This Santa Claus really likes you. So it’s okay to ask for something nice. Good kids need to be rewarded.”

What kind of present could Santa give? A nice present. I was stumped, suddenly asked like that. I managed to spit out the only word that popped into my head.

“Could you give me a doll? I want to make more friends!”

That’s probably the right kind of present to ask Santa for at this age, right? Santa smiled after hearing my request and then ‘disappeared.’

A moment later, Miro, Ari, and my grandfather appeared.

“That’s a strange conversation. He seems really obsessed with the word ‘good kid’?”

“I don’t know… But I find it even more strange that he asked about a ‘present.’ Does he actually give things?”

“Why did you tell me not to interfere? That guy’s mouth!”

“Teacher, Miro will be scared.”

Kim Muk-seong: We were going to shut his mouth and burn him!

“What are you all talking about? Fun stories?”

“Eung, Miro! Let’s go eat.”

I stared silently at the spot where Santa had disappeared. Santa suddenly appeared from behind me with the reindeer, and we talked for a while. Of course, I didn’t just stand still like a stone statue the whole time. Santa walked around naturally on the snowy ground the whole time we were talking. Now that he’s gone, there are no footprints on the snow anywhere.
