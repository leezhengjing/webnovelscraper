I Am Not a Monarch (1)

I was sinking to the bottom of the lake in the Fengyang Layer. I had just arrived at the Chije Layer. And I had transformed into a strange entity, infiltrating the bodies of the Heukrin Eoryeongmun disciples. All of me was so shocked that I simultaneously screamed.

"How are you here, Seohyeol!"

"Ah, is that what you're curious about?" Seohyeol said with a kind smile. "Why, isn't there a teleportation array in the Black Ghost Valley? I requested to use the Black Ghost Valley teleportation array formally as a Taesu. I used the Black Ghost Valley sub-myeongham in the human race to teleport to the sub-myeongham in Sappung Station, so I could arrive at the right time."

"You bastard..." I spoke through the mouth of a Heukrin Eoryeongmun disciple. "That's not what I'm asking. How did you break the barrier after 500 years...!"

The barrier I set up was not a simple one. It was designed to be extremely difficult to break before a thousand years had passed, as it was set to automatically dissolve after a millennium. Of course, someone at the level of the Union Stage could tear it apart and escape, but Seohyeol was not at that level yet. The power of the Heaven and Earth Demons could amplify each other's strength to reach two stages higher, but Seohyeol could not use my Intangible Sword at the level of the Heaven's Fear.

"How did you do it?" I asked.

Seohyeol smiled faintly. "Why are you so surprised, Seo Dou? Humans are known for their loyalty and deep emotions towards each other."

"That's news to me."

"Well, regardless of what you think... I just 'asked.' It's impossible to break the barrier with my current strength from inside, but I could at least send my 'voice' outside."

"Voice...?" I glared at him in disbelief.

"I told all the other Taesus with my split body. I said I would be in seclusion for a thousand years, and if I asked to be let out from inside, it was likely I had fallen into a demonic trance, so they should never comply. And I created General Seo to guard the entrance...?"

"Well... maybe it worked because I conveyed it sincerely? Haha..."

"..."

I stared at him for a moment, then looked at the necks of Gyo Yeom and Nokju in his hands.

"Why did you kill them?"

I felt a pang of regret for Gyo Yeom. I had heard from the Yozu that Gyo Yeom had abandoned the Yozu like an old shoe. Considering that, he deserved punishment, but I had hoped he would at least save his wife before being punished. However, Gyo Yeom's wish was completely thwarted by Seohyeol.

Seohyeol smiled brightly. "It was just a trivial prank, Seo Dou. What does it matter if a few bugs live or die?"

"..."

I didn't bother to argue and just glared at him. There was no point in arguing with a heartless being. Instead, I sneered at Seohyeol.

"Too bad for you."

Wooooong! Far away, the morning sun was rising from the east. Considering the size of the Gwanghan Realm, I didn't know how that was possible. But the sun and moon rose from the east and set in the west every day, and it was clearly 'morning' now. As the darkness of Sakwol was washed away, the entrance to Jeomuldo of the Jungnyongjin began to close as the darkness receded.

"Why did you come all the way here? You can't do anything even if you come."

Kiiiiing! I surrounded Seohyeol's body with the bodies of the Heukrin Eoryeongmun disciples. I intended to reverse-infiltrate him using the technique of the Strange Entity. However, Seohyeol just smiled warmly.

"Seo Dou, didn't you see something when you entered the otherworld of the Jungnyongjin?"

"Hmm?"

"The Kangnyeong Bongyang Saja Jungnyong Map. The place you entered is not just Jeomuldo. From the Union Stage, you can carry things in your own domain, but why would someone like the Jungnyongjin need something like Jeomuldo?"

Wooooong! As I watched Seohyeol extract something from the corpses of Nokju and Gyo Yeom, I activated the technique of the Strange Entity while he was babbling.

"Strange Entity, Reverse Infiltration!"

Chiiiiii— After sealing his ten directions, I used the technique of the Strange Entity to dig into him. However, Seohyeol just smiled calmly.

"The place you entered... During the great war that happened hundreds of thousands of years ago, the Jungnyongjin designated all the living beings of the Gwanghan Realm as protected species to protect them from extinction during the battle between Yuhodeok and Jungnyong. After teaching the concept of Kangnyeong to the living beings of the Gwanghan Realm, he showed mercy by allowing anyone who knew the concept to enter and become a protected species."

Kugugugugugu! Seohyeol's energy began to rise rapidly.

"This, this is...!"

He absorbed the energy of Gyo Yeom and Nokju, temporarily exuding the momentum of the Death Stage. His eyes shone, and familiar characters appeared around him.

Kangnyeong (康寧).

"Kangnyeong Axis, Release."

Flash! The power of Kangnyeong shone upon the heavens and the earth. At the same time, a massive sound echoed through Satoyak.

Kuuung, Cheolk! The sound of a latch opening, or a lock being unlocked. As soon as I heard that sound, I felt a chill run down my spine.

"This, this guy..."

The Jeomuldo of the Jungnyongjin had already closed, but Seohyeol reopened the door. He was coming into this place.

"You won't pass easily!"

I used all my strength to infiltrate his mind with the Strange Entity. However, I felt the connection with the Strange Entities weakening at some point.

"Haha, I've heard of this technique. It was created by the tribes of the True Demon Realm to counter the erosion of the Blood Demon Realm's demons, right?"

I saw Seohyeol smiling faintly.

"Sorry, but my technique is not as primitive and low-level as the erosion or parasitism of the Blood Demons... It will be difficult for you. Haha..."

Crack! At the same time, my vision went dark, and I felt the connection with the Strange Entities completely severed. All control over the Strange Entities that had entered Seohyeol was lost, except for the 'sight' and 'sound' of one entity. He had digested my Strange Entities and made them his own.

'Why did he leave the sight of one entity?'

And soon, I understood the reason.

Splash! Seohyeol jumped into the heavens and earth. At the same time, he skillfully navigated the illusionary formation, finding his way by observing the constellations.

'This guy...'

He had left the sight to make me anxious. I thought, feeling a surge of irritation at Seohyeol's intention.

'But it's not a big deal. Even if Seohyeol comes to the Fengyang Layer, I am sealed.'

I guessed that even Seohyeol couldn't do anything about this lake water. The lake water was so powerful that it nullified physical force and had considerable resistance to magical power.

'He can't enter this water.'

He can't enter, so what can he do?

"Ah, you're sealed inside Cheongru?"

'What?'

I felt a chill run down my spine. Seohyeol was speaking to me through the sight and hearing of the Strange Entity he had left behind.

"It must be quite troublesome. But the method to nullify Cheongru is surprisingly simple. If you make a hole in the bottom of the Fengyang Layer, Cheongru will naturally pour down to the lower layer, and Seo Dou can come out."

Chill, chill! I ground my teeth at the worst possible scenario.

'Seohyeol, this guy, now...'

"Ah, you're curious about how I read your thoughts."

Step, step... Seohyeol quickly broke through the illusionary formation and succeeded in reaching the front gate with the signboard 'Kangnyeong Bongyang Saja Jungnyong Map.'

Creak, creak... Reaching the front gate, Seohyeol began to rub his face. His face twisted, and at the same time, he transformed from the appearance of 'Cheongbal's Seoeunhyun' to the 'complete Seohyeol.' Except for the lack of horns, he was now the complete Seohyeol.

"Don't worry, Seo Dou. You'll find out soon enough. Hahaha..."

I felt a chill as if I had fallen into an ice cave. I had never felt so cold and spine-chilling even after becoming the Ghost King.

'Does he really know all my thoughts?'

Zap, zap... I felt a tingling sensation inside my mind and gathered my thoughts.

'No, I shouldn't believe everything Seohyeol says.'

"I always like to tell the truth."

'Don't be swayed by his sweet words.'

I ignored Seohyeol's words and checked all the connections with the Strange Entities, putting my consciousness into a dormant state as much as possible. Then, I accelerated my consciousness with the Extreme Phoenix Technique and prevented the waves of my consciousness from leaking out with the Mysterious Heart Technique, organizing my thoughts.

'Is he following my accelerated thoughts?'

'No, he can't follow.'

'He can't read all my thoughts. He can only read the parts that are strongly revealed.'

'Whether it's the Strange Entities or the Blood Demon's body... even if he can read my thoughts for some reason, that reason is not perfect.'

And then, Seohyeol spoke to me again as he walked through the Flowing Layer.

"Interesting, Seo Dou. Try it. I can read everything."

It was a chilling statement. But the closer he got to me, the more I felt a tingling sensation in my heart, a sense of vigilance.

And that tingling sensation made me more suspicious of Seohyeol's words.

'Can he really read everything? If he could read everything, he wouldn't need to threaten and instill fear with words. He could just read my thoughts silently.'

When the liar Seohyeol didn't tell me the truth, was 'I can read everything' the truth?

'No. Somehow...'

The stronger the tingling sensation, the more I felt I understood Seohyeol's way of speaking.

'I'm more convinced that he can't read everything.'

Judging by his actions, he was definitely reading my thoughts in some way. But it was clear.

He couldn't read 'everything.'

'In that case...'

I operated the Mysterious Heart Technique, making the waves of my consciousness complex and filling my conscious representation with countless trivial thoughts.

'Try reading all of this.'

Ziiiiing— I want to eat, General Seo looks like an idiot, why does the main body's face look like that, the soup I ate with Yeon was delicious, why can't he understand my aesthetics, Seohyeol is a bastard, I like Kang Minhee, what's Seohyeol's secret, did the main body really get eaten, if Seohyeol and the Ghost Army ordered sweet and sour pork together, would they fight or not, come to think of it, the culinary culture in the Middle Realm didn't develop well....

After filling my surface consciousness with countless useless thoughts, I hid the 'real' secret.

* * *

'Seohyeol is a chilling guy...'

I thought as I took a breath in the Chije Layer. The Chije Layer was dark. But as the darkness of the Chije Layer seemed to be absorbed into my dream body, my field of vision gradually expanded, and I waited until my vision was fully restored.

'While Seorip's mind is blocking Seohyeol's thought reading, I need to achieve something in the Chije Layer.'

After a while, Seohyeol reached the end of the Flowing Layer and was ready to ascend to the Dogo Layer. At the same time, I realized that my vision was fully restored.

'This is the Chije Layer...!'

Ooooooo— A sinister wind was howling with a ghostly sound. I opened my mouth in awe at the 'giant things' in front of me. The Chije Layer gave the impression of a 'warehouse' rather than the 'small worlds' of the other layers. Statues of Sin Recognition the size of small hills, and paintings and scrolls hanging everywhere. Large boxes and... equally vast [Jade Scrolls].

'Wait, where I'm standing...'

I realized that the ground I was standing on was not a floor but the top of a 'desk.' I had climbed onto an enormous 'desk.'

'The statue of Sin Recognition in front of me... it's not a statue.'

It was a kind of Sin Recognition 'seal.' 'Suitable for the body size of the Jungnyongjin...'

Upon closer inspection, it wasn't a warehouse. Rather, it was...

'An office.'

It was closer to the form of an 'office' where someone handled official duties. And I felt that this place was not used by the Jungnyongjin.

'The Jungnyongjin is located in one of the largest lands of the True Demon Realm.'

The entire True Dragon Alliance was practically the body of the Jungnyongjin. This office was large, but it was far too small to contain the entire body of the Jungnyongjin. Without looking further, I flew to the giant Jade Scroll on the desk to gather information. Fortunately, I could use the Flight Technique in the Chije Layer, so I got there quickly. I operated the Mysterious Heart Technique, covering the Jade Scroll with my consciousness and reading it.

'This Jade Scroll...'

My eyes shone. It was written in the language of the underworld, which I had learned from Biyul when I made the Budeok Jeseo mine. The language of the dead.

I read the contents of the Jade Scroll.

'This is...'

The Jade Scroll was none other than a will.

—To the True Dragon, my subordinate, from Haenyeong, the Second Judge General of the Kangnyeong Seat.

Ziiiiing—

"Aaaargh!!!"

As soon as I heard that [name], I felt an excruciating pressure on my mind.

'I must endure...!'

It felt like I would be 'devoured' at any moment!

"Ugh, ugh!"

At the same time, I steadied my consciousness and strongly linked the axis of wealth in Seorip's body to me. The gravitational pull of the axis prevented my consciousness from being blown away.

"Huff, huff..."

When I came to my senses, I realized that Seohyeol had already crossed half of the Dogo Layer. And around me were numerous blood letters I had scribbled with my dream body's fingers. They were filled with countless pieces of knowledge and formulas, and as soon as I saw them, I instinctively knew.

'Ah... I see.'

The Death Stage investigator living in the human race's protected area. That investigator believed that an 'entity' would resurrect inside him as he recalled the 'immortal arts' he had seen. He even vomited a handful of strange stones and sealed them. Those stones melted, leaving 'water' containing the formula to control the Cheongrin Armor.

As soon as I heard the name [Haenyeong], I knew. This entity was the one believed to resurrect inside the Death Stage investigator. And at the same time, I felt a deep sense of relief and fear.

Haenyeong could not resurrect. He was completely, absolutely annihilated.

I knew this as soon as I accepted the 'knowledge.' It was a fact I could understand because I had survived facing countless true immortals. And at the same time, I could infer the state of Cheongmunryeong.

Seeing that his symptoms were similar to mine, it seemed that his petrification was also due to accepting the information of a 'dead true immortal' like me. The existence known as the Lord of the Salt Mountain would not resurrect through Cheongmunryeong. He, too, was an annihilated entity like Haenyeong.

Of course, the difference in reaction between me and Cheongmunryeong was due to our difference in level, but it was also because the Lord of the Salt Mountain was a higher-ranking entity than Haenyeong.

'In that case... the Water Realm has an entity higher than the Second Judge General, and Cheongmunryeong glimpsed its traces...'

I felt relieved about Cheongmunryeong but more fearful about the Water Realm. I looked at the unknown formulas I had scattered. I barely resisted the urge to devour those formulas and decided to finish reading the Jade Scroll to gather more information.

—The god of the underworld has ordered the selection of a panel of judges to assist the Gwanghan Heavenly Army in their battle. The members of the panel are familiar faces to you, True Dragon. The Chief Judge General, Myungma True Lord Yuhodeok. The Reincarnation Judge General, Myunggui True Lord Yusuryeon. The Second Judge General, Goryeok True Lord Haenyeong. We were all members of the panel, and the Heavenly Army of the Golden Heaven also joined us, following the orders of the god of the underworld.

"Aaaargh!!!!!"

The names of these distant entities pierced my mind. I endured the pain, drooling and gasping for breath. It was more painful and terrifying than having my testicles removed or consuming a poison 60,000 times more painful.

The fear of being devoured by these [names] overwhelmed me. But perhaps because I had faced so many true immortals, or because I had reached the Death Stage and gained some resistance, I managed to survive without being annihilated.

'Crazy...'

My hair had turned white in the Death Stage.

'Seohyeol is approaching.'

I gritted my teeth and continued reading the Jade Scroll.

—Thanks to the Gwanghan Heavenly Army, who did not falter even against all the heavenly lords and the Lord of Light, and pushed the Lord of Light to the brink of destruction, there was a gap in the surveillance of the Heavenly King Heaven, ruled by the Lord of Light. Thanks to that, we, who govern the Five Blessings, were able to gather.

—The Chief Judge General was at a critical moment, about to ascend to the rank of the Supreme Lord, so the god of the underworld ordered him to send his subordinate, the True Dragon, instead. But the noble Chief Judge General, who was captivated by the character of Gwanghan, declared that he would witness the historic moment with his own eyes and crossed the Myungdo Heaven to descend to the Ilwol Heaven.

—I, too, rejected the position of the King of the Immortal Realm and declared my intention to join the battle with the same heart. Originally, you, my subordinate, the True Dragon, would have been in my place, but I will not take you with me.
