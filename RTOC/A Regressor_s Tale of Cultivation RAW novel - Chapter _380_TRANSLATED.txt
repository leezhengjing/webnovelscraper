**Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 380: Together with Everyone (2)**

“Hmm….” I recalled the figure of the person who, despite being struck by my attack, regenerated his body and charged at me in a frenzy.

“It seems he possesses excellent conditions for martial arts training.”

Every time he swung his weapon, every time he was hit, every time he fought an opponent. Not just simple morale, but a species that gets aroused? Whether it was martial arts or any combat-related technique, it was a species incredibly advantageous for learning.

‘No wonder they are considered one of the two evils along with the human race, who love to exploit and devour other species.’

Honestly, that sticky intent was a bit unpleasant, but aside from that, I thought they had the best conditions to become warriors.

Kim Younghoon, who was watching my reaction, chuckled and said, “Do you understand now why I said I am not a martial artist?”

“Hmm….” I pondered for a moment and then shook my head. “Um, I’m sorry. Honestly, I don’t really understand. Why aren’t you a martial artist?”

I truly didn’t know. I decided to be honest rather than pretend to know.

Kim Younghoon gathered the qi in the air and created a qi weapon. A golden dao made of qi appeared in his hand.

“What do you see me holding?”

“A sword,” I replied immediately, seeing the intent imbued in his dao.

“Correct. A martial artist is someone who wields a weapon.”

Kim Younghoon and I stepped outside the pavilion to continue our conversation.

Vroom!

Kim Younghoon, who had reached the edge of the Guangyin Domain, swung the dao in his hand at me.

“What did I just swing at you?”

“A technique.”

“Correct. We are those who train in techniques.”

He swung the dao again. This time, he swung it with the intent to truly cut me, so I drew my Chongtian Sword and met his attack.

Bang!

Although both of us had put enough force into our weapons to split the sea, our perfect control prevented a massive shockwave from occurring.

“What did we clash with?”

“Intent.”

“Correct. A martial artist is someone who swings a weapon to create techniques and clashes with intent.”

Wooong!

His eyes glowed golden.

“In the end, it’s about intent, and that intent is our soul. We imbue various intents and display them through our art. Even though we fight with weapons, we do not get consumed by the fight itself. But do you remember what was in the hands of that warrior?”

I recalled Jin Mayeol, who had charged at me with gleaming eyes. What he held was not just a simple chain sickle and sword. It was desire. He was completely consumed by sticky lust.

“…I see.”

I finally understood what Kim Younghoon was trying to say.

“Were you trying to say that ‘martial arts’ is about what you imbue in your weapon?”

“Something like that. It reminded me of something from last time. Come down.”

Thud!

After saying that, Kim Younghoon descended. It was the deep sea of the Gaolixian Realm.

Thoom—

He still managed to stand on the dimension above the deep sea.

“You are certainly strong. But if what I felt back then wasn’t a mistake, your martial arts are incomplete.”

“Well… I did combine the Tianzhi Clan’s techniques with puppet arts.”

“That’s not what I’m talking about.” He shook his head. “I just said it. Martial arts are about what you imbue in your weapon.”

“Indeed.”

“But how many weapons do you have?”

Splash, splash!

The surface of the dimension rippled, and the area above the deep sea where Kim Younghoon stood trembled.

“I wondered why you couldn’t stand on this dimensional surface last time. At our level, it shouldn’t be that difficult, so I pondered why it was hard for you. Then I found the answer.”

He smiled.

“Martial arts are about what you imbue in your weapon. But you have too many weapons. And you don’t imbue intent in all of them. That’s why your martial arts are incomplete, and because your martial arts are incomplete, your cultivation level is unstable, preventing you from standing on the dimensional surface.”

Flash!

The golden dao in his hand seemed to shine brilliantly.

“You asked how to cut a star, right? You can’t cut a real star, but I can cut something similar.”

Swoosh!

As he swung the dao, the sea seemed to ripple and split, revealing countless fragments of worlds beneath the dimensional sea. Among them, fragments of worlds with starlight were also drifting.

Kim Younghoon swung his dao towards one of those fragments. He spun in the air, drawing a circle with his dao. In the next moment, the starlight split. Following the trajectory of the circle he drew, the ‘light’ in this sea area split.

Rip!

The sky seemed to split into two for a moment, creating an illusion that spread across the entire sea area.

Kim Younghoon wiped his sweat and laughed heartily.

“I know you have many weapons. And you imbue intent in at least three or four of them. But you don’t imbue intent in all the miscellaneous ones. So either discard all the miscellaneous ones, or if you don’t want to discard them, make all of them truly yours. If you do that….”

I felt like I had grasped a clue on how to solve Zhang Yi’s task through Kim Younghoon.

“You will be able to cut starlight.”

Swoosh—

The sky that had been split returned to normal. It wasn’t space that was cut, but just the light in space, a divine technique.

I bowed my head to Kim Younghoon in gratitude.

“Thank you for your guidance.”

I had found the path I needed to take.

‘Indeed….’

Then, after bowing to Kim Younghoon, I drew the Pakdo from my mindscape. The green Pakdo was in my hand. I was confident that if I swung it once, I could destroy this entire sea area. No, not just the sea area, but I could even cut a star as Zhang Yi had said.

However, I didn’t use the Pakdo for such a purpose. Instead, I swung the Pakdo towards Kim Younghoon’s mindscape.

Boom!

The Pakdo I swung embedded itself in Kim Younghoon’s mindscape. It seemed to pierce through the head of the Phoenix, and then the Pakdo disappeared into the Phoenix.

He blinked and asked, “What is this? It doesn’t seem to be your mindscape….”

“Try infusing your mindscape into the Pakdo and communicating with it. You will meet an interesting person.”

‘Zhang Yi’s disciple should be Kim Younghoon.’

“Thank you for the advice. I will take my leave now.”

After giving Kim Younghoon a strike from Zhang Yi and a clue to communicate with Zhang Yi, I returned. Although it was a short moment, what I received from Kim Younghoon was significant.

‘Yes, he’s right.’

I had learned too many things. So, could I give meaning to all those things and use them properly?

‘No.’

I thought I had combined the Tianzhi Clan’s techniques and martial arts while creating the Sword of Heaven and Earth with Hong Suling. But in hindsight, it wasn’t a combination; it was just creating another weapon.

I performed the Danak Sword Technique from start to finish while holding the Chongtian Sword. From the first move, Wolak, to the thirtieth move, Sansimyeonhudo.

‘It’s time to create the thirty-first move.’

I went to the Wujiao Training Ground and began to organize everything I had learned so far. Starting with the Five Elements Sword Technique, the Qingmen Clan’s techniques, the Tianlin Sea Star, the Ghost Army’s circuits, the Strange Bone, the Kyutojang Sacred Art, the Yin Soul Ghost Curse, the White Orchid Sacred Art, the Changling Star Light Five Colors Technique, the Destruction of the Gods Technique, the Thunder Sword Technique, the Myriad Connections Sword, the Six Extreme Yin Thunder God, the Great Desert Sea Star, and more.

‘I’ve learned quite a lot.’

I had even created many techniques myself. Including the Black Seal Sacred Art I made recently, there were quite a few techniques I created and used myself.

I recalled countless techniques and reflected on Kim Younghoon’s words.

‘You have many weapons, but you don’t imbue intent in all of them….’

So what should I do? How can I imbue intent in my weapons?

‘There’s only one way.’

I performed the Danak Sword Technique. And in line with the techniques of the Danak Sword Technique, I began to compare the techniques of countless other techniques.

‘I will melt all my techniques into one.’

And combine techniques and martial arts. It wasn’t just about melting the Tianzhi Heart into the later stages of the Danak Sword Technique. It would be a process of integrating ‘everything I’ve learned so far’ into one.

‘Let’s begin.’

To cut a star. And to move forward!

No matter how many years it takes, I will achieve it through hellish training!!!

And about ten years passed.

* * *

‘It’s not easy.’

I succeeded in melting the Yin Soul Ghost Curse, the White Orchid Sacred Art, the Black Blood Flower, the Six Extreme Yin Thunder God, and the Great Desert Sea Star into the sword. But the sword technique has forms. Even if I melt those techniques into one move, the forms created by combining different moves. I have to melt the techniques into each of those forms and the connections between them.

‘It’s daunting.’

Honestly, I started without a clear idea of when it would end. But I continued the work.

Twenty years passed.

* * *

The bad omen I felt last time wasn’t just my intuition or a mistake. I still felt it from the sky. I consulted with others like Yeonwi and Songjin, but they seemed unable to see the celestial signs I saw. Yeonwi insisted I was possessed by an evil spirit and tried to perform an exorcism with a burning ritual, so I had to hang her upside down to bring her to her senses.

But it wasn’t just my imagination; the bad omen continued. There were frequent incidents of people being kidnapped by attacks from other sea areas. Although we managed to rescue them each time, and those who were kidnapped once were careful not to let it happen again, I still felt uneasy.

Recently, a half-human, half-fish clan member named Wi Yun, a Yuanqi demon from the Wujiao Sect, had been causing trouble by setting fires and attacking members of the sect in various branches. I wanted to capture and interrogate him, but he always managed to hide whenever I went to catch him, which was quite annoying.

While handling my duties as the Wujiao Sect Leader, I focused on building my strength and integrating my techniques and martial arts into one.

Thirty years passed.

* * *

Crack, crackle!

While training, I encountered a heart demon. I succeeded in melting all my techniques into one form. But the problem was what came after. I had to apply all those techniques to the countless variations of the Danak Sword Technique. It was overwhelmingly daunting! My talent was far from sufficient!

Crack, crackle, crackle, crackle!

A heart demon appeared, and I was devouring it.

“I can do it, I can do it, I can do it…!”

With my eyes rolling, I swallowed the heart demon and shouted.

“I must do it…!”

I had long grown tired of crying and despairing over my lack of talent. I was already approaching 4,000 years old. At this age, I couldn’t sit down and make excuses like a child!

“I will do it! No! I will!”

Talent is just an excuse. If I lack talent, I will grind my body to achieve it!

I had experienced this many times. So….

“I will do it!”

Without sitting down, I stood up and swung my sword, melting the techniques into it.

Forty years passed.

* * *

Once I got into training, it seemed I fell into madness. At some point, I started accelerating my mind and training like before. When I came to my senses, I couldn’t tell how much time had passed. What was clear was that as I integrated all my techniques into the Danak Sword Technique, I felt like I didn’t have enough time.

How many times did I repeat this madness? I was now confident that I had melted all my techniques into the first twelve forms of the Danak Sword Technique. Now, only the middle and later stages remained.

‘I’m getting there, getting there…!’

I continued to integrate the techniques while fighting deep-sea monsters. Fifty years passed.

* * *

How many times did I go mad while fighting deep-sea monsters and building my strength? I finally succeeded in integrating all my techniques into the thirty forms of the Danak Sword Technique. Now, only the countless variations and connections of the Danak Sword Technique remained to be integrated with the techniques.

“Hahaha!”

Crack, crackle!

I tore off the face of the heart demon that was tormenting me and smashed the head of a deep-sea monster to extract its core. Surprisingly, this deep-sea monster was quite strong, and its head contained an enormous core, with a rare gem embedded in the center.

I hummed as I extracted the gem and saw my reflection in it. For some reason, I felt I resembled Jin Mayeol, who had charged at me madly. So, am I not a martial artist? Is what I’m doing not martial arts?

I thought of asking Kim Younghoon if I was a martial artist, but then I remembered he hadn’t been seen recently. He seemed to be in a secluded place, communicating with Zhang Yi. With his talent, what kind of reaction would Zhang Yi have? What kind of enlightenment would he gain from Zhang Yi? Could he show hope beyond the barrier, beyond the state of Zuo Tuo Li Wang?

As I pondered this, I felt a sense of self-pity. It was contempt for myself, thinking that Kim Younghoon would go to the next stage first and tell me about it. And with that self-pity, I realized I was still a martial artist. The very fact that I had a desire for the next stage, the very fact that I longed for a higher level of martial arts, showed that I was different from Jin Mayeol.

The martial arts of the warrior race were filled only with lust, but my martial arts were filled with a longing for a higher place!

At least I was relieved by that fact and continued to train in martial arts.

Sixty years passed.

* * *

“Aaaaaah!!!”

Finally! I had integrated all my techniques into all the forms!

In actual time, it had been about seventy years, according to the sect members, but since I had accelerated my mind while integrating the techniques, it felt like hundreds of years had passed.

But I wasn’t happy.

“Why is this happening! Why!!!”

I performed the sword forms. Countless techniques followed each form. This sword was a curse, a blessing, the grace of my master, the fruit of my efforts, the heart of Seolip, the will of the Golden Thunder Sect, the research of the Black Ghost Valley, and the tenacity of the Changtian Sect.

And the Myriad Connections Sword was imbued in the forms.

Sizzle—

“Aaaaaah!!!”

A hazy mist permeated the forms, and I screamed as I tried to perform the forms. But it was wrong. It was distorted. It started to break. The forms went out of control and eventually exploded at some point.

I succeeded in integrating all the forms. But when the Myriad Connections Sword was imbued, the forms went berserk. And while I was forcibly performing the forms, I experienced something for the first time in my life.

Boom!

The Chongtian Sword slipped from my hand.

“….”

I dropped my sword. I couldn’t understand what was happening, and my hands trembled.

“I, I….”

I dropped my sword?

It was something that should never happen. But I dropped it. No, to be precise, it would be more accurate to say the sword suddenly disappeared from my hand.

My grip, which had held a sword all my life, had reached an abnormal level, and I was confident that my grip strength alone wouldn’t lose to even a demigod. But no matter how strong the grip, if what you’re holding suddenly disappears, you can’t hold onto anything.

Shocked, I stopped training in martial arts for a while and focused only on sect duties.

Why did this happen?

Eighty years passed.

* * *

Recently, I often saw Bukhyanghwa and Kim Yeon together. They seemed to have become sworn sisters, sleeping together and calling each other by their surnames.

“Why are you so late, Buk?”

“I told you not to call me that, Kim.”

“How dare you talk to your elder sister like that!”

“Kyaa! I told you not to pull my hair!”

They occasionally had minor quarrels, but they would walk around holding hands as if nothing had happened.

And then, I suddenly realized.

“Ah….”

The reason my sword forms didn’t listen to me. I thought the Myriad Connections Sword was my technique, but in hindsight, it wasn’t. As Songjin said, connections are something you create with others. Since it was created with others, it wasn’t just my technique. Trying to mix something that wasn’t mine into my sword, of course, it wouldn’t listen.

Although I still didn’t know why it exploded at the end, I understood one thing.

“I need to communicate.”

From that day, I started training in stillness rather than movement. It was training to feel the Myriad Connections Sword itself more deeply.

And ninety years passed.

* * *

I looked at the trinket I received from Bukhyanghwa and compared it to the Colorless Glass Sword. She said the trinket contained a strange stone spat out by the Qingmen Spirit, which was an enormous power source. Indeed, the trinket emitted an overwhelming power.

But it seemed Bukhyanghwa had a misconception. Since she was only in the mid-stage of Yuanqi, she didn’t seem to know, but when I infused my consciousness into the trinket, I felt nothing. In other words, there was no strange stone sealed inside. And this trinket was connected to ‘somewhere,’ and the power source used by the Bukhyang Fleet was not the power of a simple stone but a power source drawn from ‘somewhere.’

At first, I wondered if this trinket was connected to the Myriad Connections Sword, but it didn’t seem to be the case. The trinket and the Myriad Connections Sword had no reaction.

‘I should ask Kim Yeon to find the place connected to the trinket with her consciousness later.’

I couldn’t do it, but with Kim Yeon’s vast consciousness, she might succeed in finding the place connected to the trinket.

‘So, I can’t find the secret of the Myriad Connections Sword with the trinket.’

I looked at the Colorless Glass Sword, the origin of the Myriad Connections Sword. If I scattered all 3,000 swords, they would be at the level of an ordinary treasure, but if I combined them
