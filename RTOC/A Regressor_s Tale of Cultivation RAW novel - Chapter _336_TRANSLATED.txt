The Madness of the Old Monster (4)

I was momentarily frozen, not knowing what to say, and my mouth opened and closed without a sound. Watching me, Kim Yeon gave a bitter smile.

"I thought... you were finally accepting my feelings. I've liked you for so long. And when we met in the dream, you gave me the impression that you liked me too... That's what I believed."

She stood up from her seat.

"But... it was my misunderstanding. For some reason, you see someone else in me, don't you?"

"..."

I couldn't speak, my face stiffened. Seeing someone else. Yes, that was true. In a way, I wasn't saving the current Kim Yeon because I liked her, but because I had feelings for the Kim Yeon from the past, the one who was with Gwaegun. But in the end, I was deceiving myself.

"...I'm sorry."

I apologized to Kim Yeon. And I made a decision.

'Let's tell her.'

Even if it was difficult, I decided to tell her everything I could about my regression.

"There was someone who liked me before... not Kang Minhee."

I told her about the Kim Yeon from the previous timeline. I referred to her simply as 'her' and described the thousand years as 'a very long time,' but the meaning was conveyed without issue. We sat on the hill in front of the entrance to the True Demon Realm and talked. Finally, I told her everything about the Kim Yeon from the previous timeline.

"That's the end. She... died. She met me at the end... conveyed her feelings to me. And I might be projecting her onto you."

"...So that's why."

Kim Yeon nodded.

"Now I understand why you felt a sense of longing from me."

With those words, a brief silence fell between us. After a while, Kim Yeon asked a question.

"Brother Eunhyun."

"Hmm?"

She hesitated for a long time, but then closed her eyes tightly and asked me.

"...You know, right? That I... like you, Brother Eunhyun."

Kim Yeon buried her face in her knees, her face flushed red. I gave a bitter smile.

"...Yes."

"..."

An indescribable feeling flowed between us.

"...You don't intend to accept my feelings, do you?"

I was silent for a long time. I didn't expect her to come at me so quickly. Her question made me realize a feeling I hadn't known myself. I loved the Kim Yeon from that timeline, but the current Kim Yeon...

'I don't love her.'

She was still just a cute junior to me.

"...I see. Haha... I'm glad I asked."

Kim Yeon was silent for a moment, then spoke.

"Actually, I thought we were dating. When you talked to me in the dream, it was hard to distinguish the feelings, and you kept showing me that you missed me, always talking to me, comforting me, laughing with me, and being my companion. You even came to save me from Gwaegun..."

Kim Yeon laughed brightly.

"If you hadn't told me, I would have been really confused. Hehe..."

She stood up from her seat.

"Thank you for being honest with me. If you had lied to comfort me, it might have made things worse..."

She turned her back to me and spoke.

"I have a goal now, Deputy Seo Eunhyun."

I wanted to say something, but no words came out. I didn't know what to say.

"I will keep confessing to you. I will keep confessing my love until I really, really make you fall for me."

She turned her head back to look at me.

"I like you, Deputy Seo Eunhyun."

Kim Yeon was crying. No tears fell, but she was crying with a dark blue light of emotion. I hesitated for a moment, but seeing that emotion, I made up my mind. I would no longer hesitate.

"Okay."

I didn't have feelings of love for the current Kim Yeon as a lover. I had to admit that. And I had to admit that she would keep sending her feelings to me. If her feelings didn't waver, my heart might eventually fall. No, in fact, it had already fallen several times. To Bukhyanghwa. To the Kim Yeon from the previous timeline. To Hong Suryung...

"I can't accept your feelings today."

"Then I'll give them to you tomorrow."

Her eyes hardened.

"Tomorrow, the day after, the day after that, no matter how long it takes. Continuously!"

I met her gaze for a while. The eyes of someone with determination shine. She was shining.

"Do your best."

People's hearts change. But sometimes, there are hearts that don't change. And those who maintain and hone those unchanging hearts sometimes are reborn with a new perspective. I could only cheer for Kim Yeon. I couldn't like her right now. That would be deceiving my own heart. But if she kept sending her feelings to me over time...

'Then, who knows.'

My relationship with Kim Yeon would change in the future. Until now, I had deceived myself into thinking I liked her, and she had mistakenly thought we were dating. But at this moment, I revealed my true feelings, and she, despite hearing my true feelings, decided not to give up and to start over, pushing her feelings towards me. I suddenly felt afraid of Kim Yeon. If that unwavering heart changed or cooled down midway, it wouldn't matter. But if it didn't change? If it didn't, Kim Yeon might become a very significant part of me. It was natural for me to cherish someone, but loving someone was a fearful thing. I had lost love too many times and knew how painful and heartbreaking it was when love disappeared. Yes, Kim Yeon would become my most painful finger in the future.

After sorting out our relationship, time passed.

Rumble!

Huge warships crossed over from the entrance of the True Demon Realm. They were the remnants of the human race. Strangely, the Black Dragon King never appeared, and so the human army could come without interference. And leading those remnants was Jeon Myunghoon. He returned with a peaceful face and spoke to me.

"I overturned everything because they were doing something stupid like the Celestial Destruction Formation. I killed a few of the higher-ups, but since they're all in the Sacrificial Demon Realm, they'll revive on their own."

"...You killed the higher-ups?"

"Do you have a problem with that?"

"Well..."

"They wouldn't listen even when I said we had to leave quickly, insisting on activating the formation to the end. The Taesoo Association might make a fuss, but... you're a Taesoo now, so support me appropriately."

I was a bit taken aback by Jeon Myunghoon's reckless approach, but I also thought it was very like him.

"Well done."

Since the Sacrificial Demons could revive, killing a few of them didn't matter. If he killed a few and brought the humans out quickly, he did well. And soon, I was able to meet Oh Hyunseok.

"It's been a while, Seo Eunhyun."

"It's been a while, brother."

He spoke with a very tired face.

"...A lot has happened. And... I heard you became a Taesoo?"

"Yes."

"Haha. Jeon Myunghoon has grown unexpectedly, and you've become so strong already. Haha, I'm the only one still like this."

Oh Hyunseok was currently in a state of decision-making, unsure of what went wrong. Jeon Myunghoon explained with his arms crossed.

"He was originally a member of the Celestial Human Qi, but he suffered a fatal injury while blocking the demons' advance, and his current state has fallen."

Oh Hyunseok sighed.

"...I've realized a lot. When I return to the Celestial Heaven Sect, I plan to focus on increasing my level. This world really... requires strength to live like a human."

"That's true."

I agreed with Oh Hyunseok's words. But I smiled and spoke at his mention of returning to the Celestial Heaven Sect.

"However, wouldn't it be more efficient to stay with us rather than just returning to increase your level?"

I made a suggestion to Oh Hyunseok. In the previous life, I failed to gather my comrades. In this life, I had gathered Jeon Myunghoon, Oh Hyunseok, and Kim Yeon. Now, if I called Kang Minhee, everyone who could be gathered in the current situation would be together. The first goal of this life was to develop the All-Seeing Fate. It would be best to stay with talented comrades and operate the All-Seeing Fate.

'I also regretted not seeing my comrades together in the previous life...'

However, Oh Hyunseok shook his head with a regretful face.

"Sorry, but... the training method of the Celestial Heaven Sect is actually more efficient and powerful than any other sect. If I train there, I can't help but become stronger. I plan to become even stronger there first."

"..."

'The Celestial Heaven Sect is indeed efficient.'

"Why don't you join the Celestial Heaven Sect instead? You don't have to be a disciple; you can stay as a guest."

"..."

The Celestial Heaven Sect doesn't have guests. No, there are people who want to be guests, but they all run away within three days.

'The longest a guest lasted was probably seven days?'

Moreover, since guests are not inner disciples, they don't chase after them if they run away. Inner disciples, however, are pursued by senior disciples for 'discipline' if they run away. But what can they do if a guest wants to leave? Anyway, the important thing is that the Celestial Heaven Sect is not a place that leaves even guests alone, and even guests run away. If Kim Yeon or Jeon Myunghoon went there, I guarantee they would run away within five days. Of course, saying this outright would be offensive, so I softened my words.

"Sorry, but training with us would be more efficient than training at the Celestial Heaven Sect."

"Hmm? What do you mean by that?"

"Well... the Celestial Heaven Sect's leader is a Sacrificial Demon, isn't he?"

"That's right."

"At this point, both Jeon Myunghoon and Kim Yeon, and I all have power beyond the Sacrificial Demon. And I already have the qualification of the Taesoo of the Human Alliance."

I extended my hand to him.

"Honestly, it would be better for you to train with us than at the Celestial Heaven Sect. And I can find several techniques that suit you perfectly."

"Hmm..."

"Think about it. Well, if you really prefer the Celestial Heaven Sect, there's nothing I can do."

Oh Hyunseok said he would think about it, and I chatted with them for a while before standing up.

"Then, since we're all gathered, shall we go find Kang Minhee?"

"Ah, she's in the Black Ghost Valley, right?"

"Yes. Let's go."

Boom—

I connected my comrades with my power and took a step towards the Black Ghost Valley.

Flash!

Using the Shrinking Earth technique, I arrived at the Black Ghost Valley in an instant and was startled. In front of the Black Ghost Valley, Oh Hyeso, dressed in pure white, was sitting on a nearby rock, looking at me.
