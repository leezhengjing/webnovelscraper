### Demonic Sect (1)

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

Under the dark sky of the Netherworld, a massive ship moved. The ship, named 'Seomyeongham,' was said to be able to cross even the River of the Underworld. It was one of the 49 replicas of a certain divine ship owned by the Black Ghost Bone Palace. At the bow of this replica, a senior elder with the cultivation level of a combined technique, Cha Jogwi, turned around with a gleam in his eyes.

"...Yes, I have resolved everything."

"To defeat a monster, I must become a monster. That demonic sect leader must also be a fanatic influenced by a true immortal. I will defeat him in the same way."

Cha Jogwi looked at Yu Hye, a maiden ghost dressed in white, who possessed the cultivation of a member of the Sashukgi unit. He followed her gaze. Under the starlight, the shadow of Seomyeongham moved along with the ship. Clicking his tongue, Cha Jogwi ignored the two senior elders beside him. At that moment, Yu Hye's eyes turned red.

Swoosh—

Yu Hye's shadow, reflected in the starlight, transformed into that of a ghost with a dog's head. Hearing this, Cha Jogwi clicked his tongue and spoke to Baek Rin.

"...It doesn't matter. What he said was to kidnap the demonic sect leader, not to subdue the demonic sect. My goal is to subdue the demonic sect and rescue my comrades."

The entity possessing Yu Hye's body chuckled. Cha Jogwi took a drink and asked. Hearing this, Cha Jogwi frowned. He glared at the entity possessing Yu Hye's body and spoke.

Swoosh—

After a while, Yu Hye's eyes and shadow returned to normal, and she touched her head with a puzzled expression. Cha Jogwi looked at the distant white light from the bow of the ship.

Rumble, rumble, rumble—

A translucent spherical barrier covered the entire Baek Eum region. He looked around with interest. Beyond the barrier, a dark mountain came into view. On the other side of the Five Elements Mountain, a gigantic monster was crouching. Cha Jogwi's eyes sparkled.

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

An overwhelming aura befitting a combined technique ghost king emanated from Cha Jogwi's entire body, covering the Baek Eum region. Soon, the combined technique ghost kings from the famous Ghost Palace and Bongrae Island also released their auras, wary of Cha Jogwi and Seomyeongham. Just as the three forces were about to clash—

Flash!

In an instant, a multicolored light flashed from the center of the Baek Eum region. And then—

Boom!

The ultimate weapon prepared by the famous Ghost Palace. Lightning flashed from the entire body of Bi, and Bi collapsed on the spot.

Roar!

Bi howled in pain and collapsed, and panicked voices echoed from the famous Ghost Palace's side.

Rumble, rumble, rumble—

Simultaneously, a ghost king with 19 heads rose above the spherical barrier covering the Baek Eum region. Below the ghost king, a garden of countless cursed runes and bizarre flowers began to bloom. Cha Jogwi clicked his tongue.

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

The anchor hanging below Seomyeongham connected with the earth's ley lines, absorbing the surrounding ghostly energy.

Swoosh—

As Seomyeongham's hull rotated sideways, the cannons attached to its side aimed at the demonic sect leader.

Flash!

Seomyeongham's cannons fired. Simultaneously, an energy imbued with the power of the Five Elements flew from the Five Elements Mountain of Bongrae Island. The combined technique ghost kings from the famous Ghost Palace also launched their attacks, and in an instant, a tremendous explosion of light obscured the spot where the demonic sect leader Seo Eunhyun had been.

Next to Cha Jogwi, a ghost king covered in shadows and another ghost king possessing a crew member of Seomyeongham approached to watch the explosion. The senior elder specializing in possession chuckled while inhabiting the crew member's body.

Crack!

And then, in the next moment, something flew out of the explosion and struck the possessed senior elder, causing him to stagger and collapse. Cha Jogwi and the shadow ghost king were taken aback. In the crew member's shadow, a shadow with a dog's head was impaled by something shaped like a sword. The next moment—

Boom!

The crew member's body exploded. The senior elder who had been laughing with them just moments ago vanished without a trace. The area above Seomyeongham fell silent. In contrast, the famous Ghost Palace's side became chaotic.

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

Bi's body, which had been coughing, swelled up, and a heavenly tribulation boiled within it, causing Bi to explode.

Boom!

Cha Jogwi, the shadow ghost king, and Baek Rin looked at the inside of the explosion with trembling eyes. From within, a ghost king with 19 heads slowly walked out. The ghost king's body was unscathed. The Bongrae Island side, seemingly unaware of the situation, appeared to be preparing to attack the demonic sect leader again with the Five Elements Mountain. But Cha Jogwi quickly made a decision.

Clang!

The anchor was rapidly pulled up into Seomyeongham. Cha Jogwi tried to turn Seomyeongham around to escape. However, the demonic sect leader was one step ahead.

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

The spherical barrier below the sect leader began to shine, exerting an immense suction force. This suction force devoured the attack from the Five Elements Mountain and pulled the escaping Seomyeongham with tremendous power. Cha Jogwi gritted his teeth.

* * *

I illuminated the surroundings with ghostly fire from my 38 eyes, taking in the diversified view thanks to my increased number of eyes. The famous Ghost Palace seemed to have some connection with the Black Ghost Bone Palace, as the monster called Bi was identical to the one I had seen at the Black Ghost Bone Palace. It was just larger and more powerful, likely due to consuming more nutritious things. Its characteristics were still similar to the void corpses. And the void corpses had a trait of exploding when hit by a third-stage strike equivalent to a heavenly tribulation.

The famous Ghost Palace side was in complete chaos and terror. The ghost king, who had mastered a technique that placed his main body significantly in the realm of souls, also exploded and died in one blow from the Total Heaven Sword, which was entirely in the realm of souls. The Black Ghost Bone Palace side, sensing the situation, tried to escape, while the Bongrae Island side, with some misplaced confidence, continued to launch attacks imbued with the properties of the Five Elements using the mountain-shaped treasure they had brought.

But it was useless.

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

I exerted suction power towards the escaping Seomyeongham, pulling it in and devouring the attack from Bongrae Island.

Swoosh!

The energy devoured through the Great Desert Star flowed into the pre-prepared formation. The ley lines of the entire Baek Eum region were further stimulated. But it was still not enough. More power was needed to carry out the grand plan. Due to my speech, the number of followers in the Infinite Sect had decreased. About half of the ghostly beings had left the Baek Eum region. However, those who remained were burning with determination to stay with me. The overall power had halved, but the morale had doubled.

I shouted loudly towards the combined technique ghost kings of the three major forces who were glaring at me.

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

In the distance, a giant mountain imbued with the energy of the Five Elements began to rise into the sky. The mountain split into five peaks, which then flipped upside down. Three ghost kings of the Sashukgi unit were holding onto one of the peaks from above the mountain.

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

Simultaneously, a ghost king imbued with the attributes of the Five Elements charged at me.

Flash, flash, flash!

The Black Ghost Bone Palace side fired cannons at me, and a combined technique ghost king made of shadows threw a shadow scythe at me.

Whirr—

I drew out the Colorless Glass Sword from one of my mouths. Three thousand Colorless Glass Swords began to dance beneath my feet.

Whizz—

Three thousand swords simultaneously used the Moon Water Palace technique and disappeared. I swung the Total Heaven Sword at the Five Elements ghost king charging at me from the left. With a halo of the Three Taiji behind my head, I focused my mind.

'The shadow scythe thrown by the shadow ghost king, the Five Elements mountain, the Five Elements ghost king, Seomyeongham's cannons.'

There is a point where all these attacks can be cut in one stroke.

'Draw it.'

The Heaven Clan and Earth Clan each obtain information in different ways. The Heaven Clan uses short-term foresight, while the Earth Clan uses a form of 'inference' through the flow of heavenly and earthly energy. So how does the Heart Clan obtain information? How does their ability to read emotions help in battle?

The Heart Clan's eyes, to be blunt, are not very helpful in front of beings with such overwhelming power. Even if they foresee the path of the attack, what can they do? The difference in power is so vast that they can't block it, and combined technique cultivators possess spiritual power, making it impossible to dodge. The Heaven Clan can read such things with short-term foresight, and the Earth Clan can infer them through the flow of energy.

Therefore, for the Heart Clan to fight against these powerful beings, they need something different.

Whirr—

My upper dantian felt like it was about to explode with heat.

'Draw it.'

It's not future foresight. It's not rational inference. It's simply drawing the 'scene' you desire. And then, using all your martial power to reach that 'scene.'

Yes, realizing the reality you desire. That is the power the Heart Clan must develop to oppose the powerful Heaven and Earth Clans.

Whirr—

Single Peak Sword Technique. First move. Moon Crossing the Mountain!

A simple horizontal slash. But within the trajectory of that single stroke, all the attacks are drawn in and cut away.

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

The Five Elements mountain, which was falling, was momentarily deflected. The ghost king of Bongrae Island, with the power of the Five Elements, had his upper body severely cut and retreated. Seomyeongham's cannons and the scythe were cut and scattered.

'Blocked one attack.'

But it starts now.

Sizzle—

The Great Desert Star I had set up devoured the power of the other forces that had just been repelled. But the ghost king of Bongrae Island regenerated his body, and Seomyeongham gathered energy again. Now, the ghost kings of the famous Ghost Palace also seemed to be preparing to join the battle.

The eighth move of the Single Peak Sword Technique, Flowing Valley, is a technique that deflects attacks. The ninth move, Mountain and Water Painting, scatters sword marks in all directions. Combining these two moves creates a technique that scatters attacks in all directions while deflecting the opponent's attacks.

Boom, boom, boom!

The sword energy of the Total Heaven Sword rampaged in all directions, scattering the attacks of the ghost kings charging at me.

The thirteenth move, Wandering the Mountains, scatters sword energy in all directions, and the fifteenth move, Layered Mountains, splits the sword energy into thorny brambles. 

Slash!

The Total Heaven Sword seemed to stretch out, grinding the ghost kings of the famous Ghost Palace charging at me into pieces.

Combine the moves. Transform them. Apply them. My sword was a storm. It was a wave, and at the same time, it was a towering mountain. It was a high cloud, and also a single blooming flower. This was the formless sword. At the same time, it was the Total Heaven Sword that combined all changes and hues.

Countless changes of the Total Heaven Sword seemed to gather in my embrace for a moment, then burst out in an instant. This was the Single Peak Sword Technique. A message from someone to cut through any mountain in front of you and move forward.

Boom, boom, boom!

Thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of sword strikes burst out in an instant. Simultaneously, one of the peaks of the Five Elements mountain was completely cut away.

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

In an instant, the ghost kings of Bongrae Island, whose peak had turned to dust, stared at me in shock.

Whirr, whirr, whirr!

And then, the transparent Moon Water Formation activated, scattering storms in all directions.

* * *

"Damn it! What is that monstrous guy!"

"Who the hell reported that lunatic as a member of the Sashukgi unit!!!"

Cha Jogwi, too exhausted to use spiritual speech, screamed out loud.

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

The hull was being cut by something transparent. They tried to escape, but the spherical barrier's insane suction force was pulling them in. They couldn't fight back either. The invisible and intangible [something] swirling around that monster literally 'ground up' anyone who approached.

Cha Jogwi gritted his teeth and shouted at the shadow ghost king.

"I'll send the signal! Let's deploy the domain!"

"It's not enough for just the two of us to deploy our domains! All the combined technique cultivators here need to deploy their domains simultaneously to trap him!"

Cha Jogwi screamed towards the combined technique cultivators of the famous Ghost Palace and Bongrae Island. Initially, the combined technique ghost king of Bongrae Island, who had been at the forefront of fighting the demonic sect leader, was now desperately trying to escape, far away from the demonic sect leader.

"Everyone! We need to combine our strength!"

Cha Jogwi shouted. But the combined technique cultivators of the famous Ghost Palace and the combined technique ghost king of Bongrae Island ignored him, screaming as they fled.

"Damn it, if we combine our strength, we can catch him! Cowards!"

"Then you deploy your domain first! Then we'll deploy ours!"

"Damn it...!"

Cha Jogwi's face turned red with anger, but he gritted his teeth and formed a hand seal with the shadow ghost king.

"Open!"

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

Centered around Cha Jogwi, his domain expanded. The domain quickly spread across the entire Baek Eum region, trapping the demonic sect leader. The shadow ghost king's domain overlapped with Cha Jogwi's, pressing down on the demonic sect leader.

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

And the demonic sect leader's movements slowed. Only then did the ghost kings of Bongrae Island and the famous Ghost Palace brighten up.

"Haha, seeing that he can't resist the domain, he's not a true combined technique cultivator!"

"A mere wretch who gained power by being influenced by a true immortal...! I'll show you the true power of a combined technique cultivator!"

Their domains overlapped with the domains of the ghost kings of the famous Ghost Palace and Bongrae Island. The four combined technique ghost kings prepared their ultimate techniques while their domains overlapped.

Cha Jogwi formed a ghost palace with a ghost head, compressing energy to form an arrow. The shadow ghost king created a large scythe made of shadows. The ghost king of the famous Ghost Palace formed the shadow of a ferocious beast with 108 heads, and the ghost king of Bongrae Island formed a ghost bird imbued with the power of the Five Elements.

Swoosh, swoosh!

Clang, clang!

The 55 Sashukgi ghost kings they had brought also used their spiritual power to suppress the demonic sect leader with forbidden techniques and curses.

"Die, you evil demonic sect leader!"

And the demonic sect leader, Seo Eunhyun, laughed.

Flash!

White flowers began to bloom around him as he unleashed countless sword strikes. The next moment, the world was bathed in light.
