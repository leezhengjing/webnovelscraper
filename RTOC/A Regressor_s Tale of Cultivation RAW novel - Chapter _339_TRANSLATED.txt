The Madness of the Old Monster (7)

Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa!

The dragon's form turned into a beam of light and shot down into the pit, exuding divine power. The sea dragon's form scattered like a spray of water, covering Seo Eunhyun and his party. As Seo Hyul formed a hand seal, the gravitational pull from the Blood Yin Realm became overwhelmingly strong, drawing Seo Eunhyun and his party towards it. Seo Hyul seemed to be affected by the pull as well, but when Oh Hyeso extended her hand and overlaid the form of a black dragon onto Seo Hyul's body, the effect disappeared. She then unleashed a black breath downward from the black dragon's mouth.

Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa!

The giant of the stars, Oh Hyunseok, feeling particularly betrayed, tried to ascend in a frenzy. Purple energy boiled from his entire body. The giant of the stars, Oh Hyunseok, transformed into a colossal being covered in purple steam. His fierce eyes glowed through the purple mist. Oh Hyeso covered her mouth with her hand, suppressing a laugh as she responded to Oh Hyunseok's voice.

"Oh my, family? We're not even blood-related, so what family? Ah, that expression is so amusing. Truly, the Oh clan is full of affection. The Oh family... heh heh."

"Hahaha, that's impossible, Brother Hyunseok. 'Father' was just self-satisfaction. I observed 'Father' more than anyone, so why are you pretending to know better? Do you want to play family? Should I call you by your original title, Stepfather?"

Oh Hyeso laughed heartily and extended her palm towards Oh Hyunseok. A massive black dragon's form poured down on Oh Hyunseok, and he couldn't withstand it, falling into the pit. Kim Yeon extended her consciousness to bind Oh Hyunseok, preventing him from falling into the Blood Yin Realm.

"Now, who should I drop next...?"

As Oh Hyeso looked down, searching for her next target, a flash of light and a thunderous roar erupted.

"Kyaaa!"

Six lightning-formed flags flew in, piercing Oh Hyeso's arms, legs, back of the head, and waist. Black clouds formed in the white space, and the flags embedded in Oh Hyeso acted as lightning rods, attracting bolts of lightning. Lightning struck down relentlessly. Oh Hyeso screamed and tried to escape, but the flags embedded in her body shimmered, pinning her down. Jeon Myunghun, with six arms, climbed up from below, his eyes gleaming fiercely.

Thud, thud, thud, thud!

Jeon Myunghun climbed up nimbly using his six arms, muttering to himself. Finally, Jeon Myunghun's hand overcame the gravitational pull and emerged from the pit. He locked eyes with Seo Hyul, who stood above him. Seo Hyul smiled and stroked his chin.

"Hmm, at first, I thought you were Yang Dou's reincarnation, but it seems you're not. If you were Yang Dou, you would have used Hyeso's soul for a human sacrifice and borrowed the power of the Blood Yin to counterattack me."

Jeon Myunghun, taken aback by the sinister method, looked dazed. Seo Hyul smiled gently.

"Therefore, it's most accurate to think of you as not Yang Dou's reincarnation, but rather Seo Dou's pet."

At that moment, five blood-red flags floated above Seo Hyul's head.

"Go, Five Elements Blood Flags."

Jeon Myunghun instinctively felt fear as he looked at the blood-red flags. He had experienced Seo Eunhyun's torture technique a few times! However, he grinned wickedly and opened his mouth. Lightning shot out, turning all of Seo Hyul's Five Elements Blood Flags into dust. But Seo Hyul had already used the Five Elements Blood Flags to distract him and approached Oh Hyeso, pulling out all the lightning flags embedded in her body.

"Hah... I thought I was going to die. You've grown a lot, Mr. Jeon. You were just a useless employee who did nothing but play around at the company, and now you can do this?"

"I won't fall for the same trick twice."

Oh Hyeso formed a Taiji symbol between her hands. The white space shook, and Jeon Myunghun's hand, which had emerged from the pit, seemed to distort as the space itself separated, causing him to fall back down. The light of the Glass Peacock struck Jeon Myunghun's head directly. Jeon Myunghun, with a dumbfounded expression, fell downward, and Kim Yeon desperately held onto him, preventing him from falling.

After dropping Jeon Myunghun, Oh Hyeso looked down at those still holding on. Kim Yeon, Hong Beom, and Kang Minhee. Among them, Kim Yeon was holding onto Seo Eunhyun, Oh Hyunseok, and Jeon Myunghun, preventing them from falling, while Hong Beom was holding onto Kim Yeon. Therefore, the only one capable of counterattacking was Kang Minhee. Oh Hyeso broke into a cold sweat as she saw the black sphere boiling below.

"...As expected, that damn thing is the most troublesome."

"Haha... That person is also an interesting helper. Is that the Ghost Dao Yin Fire Line? No, even without the Ghost Dao Yin Fire Line, that helper has incredible talent."

Seo Hyul also revealed his reptilian eyes as he watched Kang Minhee's energy surge below.

"If I had known, I would have brought that helper instead of Hyeso. I regret it a little. Haha..."

"I assure you, if it were Minhee, you might have been devoured instead."

"Haha, that's impossible unless it's a monster or a divine clan. Anyway..."

Both Seo Hyul and Oh Hyeso tensed up, glaring at Kang Minhee, whose energy was surging madly from the pit. Kang Minhee's energy was growing. Her power, which was at the early stage of the Four Destructions, was reaching the mid-stage, late stage, and even the Great Perfection! Kang Minhee was absorbing the Ghost Kings in real-time, building a pillar of Ghost Kings.

Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa!

Above the white space, the black clouds summoned by Jeon Myunghun did not dissipate but instead condensed further, gathering the energy of heaven and earth inside. The heavenly tribulation stirred. However, before the heavenly tribulation could strike properly, a torrent of black ghost energy surged out of the pit.

Kwa-kwa-kwa!

The ghost energy pierced the sky. The heavenly tribulation shattered before it could strike, scattering into pieces. Seo Hyul's expression twisted, and Oh Hyeso's face turned serious.

"What kind of madness is this...?"

"...I see. The Blood Yin Ghost Labyrinth is supporting that helper. Even with the power of the Blood Yin, this is the outer edge of the underworld..."

Seo Hyul's vertical eyes glowed red.

"Such incredible potential. The possibility of reaching the Shattering Star stage..."

Seo Hyul stroked his chin and smiled brightly.

"That helper... I must obtain them. It's too wasteful to throw them to the Blood Yin."

At the same time, a thick darkness spread from Seo Hyul. Ten 'eyes' appeared within the darkness, staring directly at Kang Minhee, who screamed. Seo Hyul laughed, his eyes glowing with blood-red light.

* * *

Seo Hyul delved into Kang Minhee's mind. He smiled faintly.

"Her mind is like a miniature underworld. She has several ghosts stored inside... And yet, the ghosts are not rampaging but are perfectly calm. This is unbelievable."

Seo Hyul gradually peered deeper into Kang Minhee's mind, laughing.

"I've obtained a being with the talent of the ages. The power to stabilize ghosts is terrifying, but it's not as troublesome as Hyeso's abilities..."

As Seo Hyul looked deeper into Kang Minhee's mind, he suddenly saw something at the center of the ghosts.

"Hmm?"

The ghosts were worshipping it. The pressure emanating from it kept the ghosts calm and obedient to Kang Minhee.

"Could it be...?"

Chills ran down Seo Hyul's spine as he guessed what it was. He tried to withdraw from Kang Minhee's mind, not wanting to get entangled with 'it.' But it was too late. The being beyond 'it' noticed Seo Hyul.

'It' was a [hole]. Inside Kang Minhee's mind, there was a 'hole' connected to 'somewhere.'

: : Did you dare to peek at the Emperor? : :

A colossal will filled Kang Minhee's mind. Her mind, which had been filled with twilight, was instantly engulfed in darkness. Seo Hyul, with a serious expression, frantically tried to escape from Kang Minhee's mind. The oldest and darkest one. The deepest and greatest one. That being did not react. But the one seated at the right hand of that being revealed their wrath, crossing the hole to punish Seo Hyul.

* * *

Boom!

"...Huh?"

Oh Hyeso dumbly looked beside her. It happened in an instant. Seo Hyul's head, which had attempted a spell on Kang Minhee, exploded. Seo Hyul's soul, with no head above the neck, staggered for a moment before dissolving into a handful of darkness and flowing away. Crackle, crackle! Oh Hyeso tried to react, but her head seemed to freeze, and she collapsed on the spot. It wasn't just Oh Hyeso. No one present looked well. Kim Yeon looked like she was about to vomit, and Hong Beom's eyes were bloodshot as he looked up at Kang Minhee. Seo Eunhyun, Jeon Myunghun, and Oh Hyunseok, who had escaped Oh Hyeso's tricks, were also paralyzed with fear. No, Jeon Myunghun gritted his teeth despite trembling with fear. It was a similar feeling.

'Heavenly punishment... It feels similar to that time...!'

Kang Minhee clutched her head and screamed. A colossal being was trying to emerge from within her, exerting its power in this world. The ghosts beside Kang Minhee screamed and merged into one. The massive Ghost King, formed from the fusion, had the energy of the Great Perfection. However, the Ghost King, instead of showing arrogance, displayed a look of terror and slit its own belly.

Shaaak!

A black flag emerged from the Ghost King's slit belly. The Ghost King, with its belly split open, cried tears of fear and shouted in a trembling voice. As the Ghost King waved the flag and shouted, the ghostly horde under its command trembled in fear and echoed the shout.

Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa!

Kang Minhee's form began to change. Her eyes emitted a blue ghostly flame, surpassing her human form. Her hair spread out in all directions, shimmering. Behind her, a massive shadow enveloped Kang Minhee. The colossal being glared at the entrance of the Blood Yin Realm, which was still exerting its gravitational pull on Kang Minhee and Seo Eunhyun's party.

: : Remnant of the past. Live according to your name and stop imitating the noble one. If your actions continue to desecrate the noble predecessor, I will annihilate you, even at the cost of the Emperor's wrath. If you understand, hold your breath and shut your filthy mouth. : :

At the will of the colossal being, the entrance to the Blood Yin Realm rapidly shrank and closed. The colossal being then looked up at the sky, seemingly observing a distant dimension beyond the Blood Yin Ghost Labyrinth created by Seo Hyul.

: : Is the mountain about to fall? Once again, the Emperor is being confined. As the gods begin to move, the age of myths is returning. : :

The black being muttered as it looked down at Kang Minhee.

: : Since the insect has noticed, it would be best to hasten the awakening. Emperor, if we delay, the light will notice, so act now. : :

The shadow finished speaking and receded, merging back into Kang Minhee. Kang Minhee screamed. The colossal being, about to return through Kang Minhee's mind, suddenly shifted its gaze to two suspicious figures. Behind the half-conscious Oh Hyeso, Seo Hyul was pulling her, trying to extract her. Below Kang Minhee, Seo Eunhyun, who had regained his senses, was forging a sword at the level of the soul.

Seo Eunhyun was flying towards Kang Minhee at a furious speed, holding a multicolored sword, cutting through the darkness.

The colossal being's momentum was cut. At the same time, Seo Hyul, having extracted Oh Hyeso, cast thousands of eyes into the Blood Yin Ghost Labyrinth.

Takhonmantian!

The Blood Yin Ghost Labyrinth moved under the influence of Takhonmantian, attempting to imprison Kang Minhee. The Myeolshingeopcheon became a blade to cut through the remnants of the colossal being's presence within Kang Minhee. The colossal being, returning to its original place, glared sternly at Seo Hyul's Takhonmantian.

: : Sinner, for the crime of daring to gaze upon the holy face, I seal the eyes of your mask for a thousand years. For a thousand years, you will see nothing but darkness. : :

Thousands, no, millions of eyes were simultaneously shrouded in darkness. Across the entire region, those who had encountered Seo Hyul felt a strange sensation and touched their heads. They all felt something rampaging inside their heads, but soon it felt like a parasite in their brains had fallen asleep. They all found it strange for a moment but moved on, thinking it was a good thing.

Inside the Blood Yin Ghost Labyrinth, the colossal being looked at Seo Eunhyun.

: : One who knows righteousness. I wish to bless you, but the Emperor deems it unnecessary, so I will only take away the calamity you have brought upon yourself. Do not forget your resolve to repent and your thoughts for your comrades. : :

Crack!

The Myeolshingeopcheon, which Seo Eunhyun had unleashed, shattered as the being exerted its power, and Seo Eunhyun was covered in blood. Having completed its task, the colossal being fully returned through Kang Minhee's mind. Kang Minhee, now a completely new being, screamed. But Seo Eunhyun did not stop. Despite the Myeolshingeopcheon being shattered and his body being crushed, he flew towards Kang Minhee.

Flash!

As the light swirled, Seo Eunhyun finally plunged the multicolored sword into Kang Minhee's chest.

* * *

"Please, please...!"

I gritted my teeth and looked at Kang Minhee. I didn't want this life to end like this. But more than that, I couldn't stand to see my precious people being destroyed by the whims of these colossal beings.

"Kang Minhee, please...! Come to your senses...!"

And then, it seemed like reason returned to Kang Minhee's eyes.

Flash!

For a moment, Kang Minhee's message flowed into my mind.

"What? What do you mean... No! Don't accept it! You can resist fate!"

Kang Minhee's lips moved slightly. She seemed to smile sadly for a moment.

Rumble―

The gravitational pull swirled, and the 'pit' leading to the Blood Yin Realm reopened. Kang Minhee pushed me away. She smiled at me and moved towards the center of the Blood Yin Ghost Labyrinth created by Seo Hyul. She was to be sealed. Ironically, by the collaboration of Seo Hyul and me, she would be trapped in the center of the Blood Yin Ghost Labyrinth for hundreds of years, calming herself alone. And, as she had conveyed to me, she would follow the command given to her by the god of death.

"Kang Minhee!!!"

I screamed and tried to reach her, but I was helplessly sucked into the new 'entrance' created by her gravitational pull. Not just me, but Kim Yeon, Jeon Myunghun, Oh Hyunseok, and Hong Beom were all sucked into the new entrance created by Kang Minhee. I was drawn into the darkness, watching Kang Minhee lose her reason again.

* * *

"..."

When I opened my eyes, I realized I was floating on a black river.

'Here...'

I staggered and stood up. Strangely, the river did not submerge my body, and I could stand on it as if it were solid ground. My feet were slightly submerged, but only a little. As I looked around in confusion, I noticed something below the river.

"Master, you're awake!"

"...! Hong Beom!?"

I was startled to see Hong Beom on the riverbank. He was being devoured by a giant carnivorous plant-like creature.

"Master, save your comrades first! I'll get out quickly! You can pull them up with your gravitational pull!"

"...Understood."

I hurriedly pulled my comrades up from the riverbed. After dragging them to the riverbank, I checked their condition. Fortunately, they were all relatively unharmed.

"...But where is this place...?"

I cut down the carnivorous plant trying to devour Hong Beom and looked around. The air was filled with black ghost energy instead of the energy of heaven and earth. It was different from the True Demon Realm. The surroundings were eerily quiet, giving the impression of a 'side path.' Hong Beom, having returned to his human form, shook off the mucus on his body.

"Master, let's take out the Yeonjin."

"The Yeonjin?"

"Yes, it would be best to contact Yeonwi and ask if she knows where this place is. Yeonwi has a lot of experience and knowledge."

"Good idea."

I took out the Do Won Do and released Yeonjin. As soon as Yeonjin emerged from the Do Won Do, she shouted.

"Hey! Senior, it's all good, but why did you take so long to release me? Be honest, you forgot about me, didn't you!?"

"Um... I'm sorry."

I realized I had forgotten to release Yeonjin since we crossed over to the Guanghan Realm. Feeling immensely guilty, I apologized to Yeonjin.

"Ugh, really. If it weren't for the ancestor's words, I would have just... Ugh! Ugh!"

Yeonjin, who was about to grumble, suddenly started coughing up blood.

"...! Yeonjin!?"

I rushed to Yeonjin in shock. At that moment, Yeonjin's eyes rolled back, and she quickly sat in a lotus position, expelling the ghost energy around her. I realized that 'she' inside Yeonjin had awakened due to the life-threatening situation.

"You reckless fools, didn't you say you were ascending to the Guanghan Realm!? Why are you here!"

"Yeonwi..."

I explained the situation to the angry Yeonwi.

"So, you got caught up in a complicated incident in the Guanghan Realm and ended up here?"

"Yes. Do you know where this place is?"

Yeonwi rubbed her head,
