君(군)이 아니다 (4)

“끄아아아아아아!!!”

Seo Hyul suddenly began to scream. It was a horrifying scream, unlike anything I had ever heard before.

Puff!

At the same time, part of Seo Hyul's head turned into salt and started to trickle down to the ground. Seo Hyul seemed to try to hold his crumbling head with trembling hands, but even his hands began to turn into salt and fall apart.

“...”

“...”

Seolip and I stood there, momentarily speechless as we watched the scene.

‘What on earth did this guy touch?’

Anyway, it was a good thing. I gripped my sword tightly, my eyes gleaming.

“Now.”

Seolip used his magic, pulling out a curse talisman and the Five Elements Blood Curse Formation. Now that Seo Hyul had shown a gap, it was time to drive him out and reclaim my body.

Eojun (御前). The first step. Through self-reflection and compression, I reached beyond the realm of the divine.

‘I didn't need to seek it externally.’

The essence of martial arts was already within me. Everything I had learned was already inside. Why did Jang Ik name this state Eojun (御前)? Because self-reflection is the way to reach the presence of a great being.

Kiiiiing—

A single sword that compressed everything within me. Even my mental image was contained in this sword.

“Here I go.”

Swoosh!

I became the sword. A single sword of light flew towards Seo Hyul. Just as Jang Ik had embedded his sword into my mental image, I shot into the filthy mental image of Seo Hyul.

I overlaid the existence of 'me' over the existence of 'Seo Hyul.' Although it was theoretically possible with the Ten Thousand Connections Path, it wasn't just relying on history; 'the current me' also drove him out. That was the 'real' plan I had hidden from Seo Hyul and conveyed to Seolip.

By simultaneously utilizing the abilities of the Ten Thousand Connections Path and the first step of Eojun, I took my place inside Seo Hyul.

* * *

Swoosh!

As soon as Seo Eunhyun entered Seo Hyul's inner self, Seolip activated the Five Elements Blood Curse Formation. 

Sizzle—

A black ghostly flag was created, turning the area around Seolip into a field of black flags.

“Go.”

Swoosh!

Countless black ghostly flags gathered like a swarm of bees and plunged towards Seo Hyul. While Seo Eunhyun took control of Seo Hyul's mental image from the inside using Eojun and the Ten Thousand Connections Path, Seolip was tasked with imprinting the 'pain' Seo Eunhyun had experienced onto Seo Hyul from the outside.

The fear and pain felt when facing Jinseon. The castration. The 60,000-fold pain poison. The pain of losing Changhoja right before his eyes. The loneliness, sorrow, and pain of being modified for a thousand years. The situation when he first awakened the Yin Soul Ghost Curse. The loneliness of having to explore beyond martial arts alone, leaving only Kim Younghoon behind. The pain of leaving his master behind after bowing to him. The pain of losing his disciples. The countless connections he had to let go of.

All the immense pain that 'Seo Eunhyun' had experienced was embedded into Seo Hyul's mind. If Seo Hyul had brainwashed Seo Eunhyun to turn him into Seo Hyul, what they were doing was the opposite. They were brainwashing Seo Hyul to turn him back into Seo Eunhyun.

Now, when Seo Hyul had suddenly started turning into salt and crumbling, was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Just as I thought that.

Puff!

“Ugh...!”

Suddenly, Seolip also grabbed his head. Part of Seolip's head also turned into salt and started to crumble. Although his entire head didn't crumble like Seo Hyul's, part of him suddenly turned into salt.

“What, what is this?”

Seolip was bewildered, but soon he looked around and understood. The Black Scale Fish Spirits, the Spirit Scale Tribe, the Cold Spirit Tribe, the Leaf Tower Tribe, and others that Seo Hyul had assimilated. Many of them were also having their heads turn into salt and crumble.

And this was happening throughout the entire Ilwolcheon.

* * *

Gwanghan Realm.

The combined stage Taesu, Wilyeongseon, who had conversed with Seo Hyul and released him, suddenly grabbed his head and collapsed to the ground.

“Ugh...!”

Part of his head turned into salt and started to crumble. It wasn't just him. Those who had conversed with Seo Hyul in the Black Ghost Bone Valley also had their heads turn into salt and crumble. In the case of the Black Elder Heogwak, it was particularly severe.

“Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh!”

About three-quarters of his face had turned into salt and was melting away. The same was true for Changhoja.

“Ahhh!”

Half of Changhoja's face had turned into salt and was melting away. All the celestial beings who had met and conversed with Seo Hyul were either spewing salt from their faces or having parts of their heads turn into salt and crumble.

The same was true for the Jinryong Alliance of the Ji Tribe.

“Ahhh! Sister!”

“Ahhh!”

Seeing Gyuryeon spewing salt from her mouth, her younger sister Gyuhwa turned pale and infused her with life force. However, even Gyuhwa, who had conversed with Seo Hyul, had part of her face turn into salt and fall off.

“Ahhh!”

Jinryong Alliance of the Ji Tribe. The hidden floor in Bongmyeongju. Inside the vast manor.

Cough, cough!

A woman there coughed and spewed some salt, then opened her eyes with a meaningful smile.

“Oh my, our great lord has finally shown a gap?”

Her eyes curved into a smile.

“Now, I might be able to see your shrouded past...”

Her hand reached out into the air.

“Shall we find Seo Hyul's [pillar]?”

Above the land of Malryu, which could enter the Sappung Station. Inside the strange fortress gliding quickly above it. Inside, Gwaegun suddenly scratched his chin with a surprised expression.

Scratch, scratch.

A small amount of salt, about the size of a pinky nail, fell from Gwaegun's chin. Considering how long he had known Seo Hyul, it was an absurdly small amount.

“...? What is this?”

Gwaegun didn't pay much attention and focused on steering the strange fortress.

* * *

Goryeok Realm, above the lakeside where a massive fleet was stationed. Inside the command ship of the fleet.

A woman in white, holding a trinket and meditating, suddenly grabbed her head.

“Ugh...”

Her face turned into salt and crumbled away. Sizzle—

She quickly regenerated her face, but she opened her eyes with a puzzled expression.

“Why me...?”

Goryeok Realm. Inside the eastern hall above the massive mountain range next to the fleet.

“Master!”

Part of Songjin's skull suddenly turned into salt and crumbled. Seoran, seeing this, became anxious. And at some point, Seoran also grabbed her head.

“Ugh... my head...”

* * *

Regardless of whether it was the Gwanghan Realm, Goryeok Realm, or the Water Realm, all those who had met and conversed with 'Seo Hyul' had salt trickling down from their heads.

I entered Seo Hyul's inner self, digesting his mental image and existence.

‘There are really so many.’

It wasn't just those Seo Hyul had conversed with and implanted arrays into. There were countless others who had already been completely transformed into 'Seo Hyul.' Seo Hyul was already everywhere in this world.

I watched from inside Seo Hyul as he constantly communicated with the 'other Seo Hyuls' outside. It was like watching brain cells. Each of the countless Seo Hyuls acted as a nerve, exchanging opinions and information with countless other Seo Hyuls, thinking and judging as one 'brain.'

I realized the terror of Seo Hyul as I faced the endlessly expanding darkness.

Anyone who conversed with Seo Hyul, unless they were overwhelmingly superior in realm, would have an impression of Seo Hyul imprinted in their mind. This impression itself became an array, forming Seo Hyul's personality within them. And those who had Seo Hyul's personality formed within them would instantly develop a 'liking' for Seo Hyul.

The reason everyone Seo Hyul met evaluated him positively. The reason everyone in the Water Realm had absolute trust in Seo Hyul's words. I muttered the name of Seo Hyul's technique that emerged from the darkness with a sense of bewilderment.

“Immortal Technique, Turbid Soul Fills the Sky. So that's the name of your technique.”

The more people Seo Hyul met. The more he appeared in front of the public and imprinted 'himself' on them. Seo Hyul would form within them, making them act for Seo Hyul unconsciously.

Seo Hyul's plans rarely failed. His predictions were rarely wrong. The reason was simple. Everyone who had met him would inevitably move in a way that benefited him.

The countless human relationships I saw when I was assimilated with Seo Hyul. The confidence that I could twist those relationships to benefit me. It wasn't confidence or talent; it was just 'fact.'

A terrifying ability. Seo Hyul increases over time. If those Seo Hyuls meet people, they too will eventually become Seo Hyul. If those Seo Hyuls fill the world, the world itself would become Seo Hyul.

‘The only fortunate thing is that all Seo Hyuls share the memory of the Jinseon he saw in the Ten Thousand Connections Path.’

The darkness was quite noisy. I slowly pushed Seo Hyul out of my body, watching the Seo Hyuls debate joyfully and noisily.

Ziiing—

Countless Seo Hyuls communicated in their own language. Normally, it would be an incomprehensible language, but due to being assimilated by Seo Hyul, I could understand it to some extent.

—It's dangerous.

—We must protect □□. As long as we have that, I am safe.

—No, we don't need to go as far as □□.

—Yes, let's gather it in one place.

—Where should we gather it?

—It's best to put it in the most useless one.

—How do we judge what's useless?

—Based on the success or failure of the plan.

—Then...

Swoosh—

I felt as if billions of unpleasant gazes were looking at me from the darkness.

—The one who failed to parasitize the second-level dangerous entity should take responsibility.

‘I see. So that's how it is...’

I seemed to understand the 'Seo Hyul' system to some extent. Just as I thought that.

Beyond the deep darkness.

‘Hmm?’

I saw the Taiji (太極). The circulation of Yin and Yang, the eternal rotation. The totality of history. Somehow, I could feel the presence of countless celestial beasts' true blood within that Taiji.

And as the Taiji rotated, it shattered the 'darkness.'

Crash—

At the same time, I saw something unbelievable beyond the darkness. A 'clear light' that I thought could never exist within Seo Hyul's inner self burst forth from beyond the darkness.

I was bewildered but also excited.

‘This is my chance to uncover Seo Hyul's true identity!’

Swoosh!

Using the ability of the first step of Eojun, I shot towards the gap of light.

Crash!

I became a sword and lodged myself in the gap of light. My mind widened the gap, and the Taiji flowed into it.

And.

Ziiing—

Before I could properly see the inside of the light, I was repelled by the concentrated mental attack of billions of 'Seo Hyuls.'

“Ha, hahaha, ahahahaha...!!!”

‘I’ laughed out loud. That is, my original body. The body of 'Seo Eunhyun.' Although my body was turning into salt, I had regained significant control over the body that Seo Hyul had taken.

I laughed maniacally.

“Seo Hyul! Seo Hyul! Seo Hyul!!!”

Until now, I had thought of Seo Hyul's identity in connection with the underworld's judges. That he might be Myungmajin-gun Yoo Ho-deok. Or the Myung-gwi-jin-gun Yoo Soo-ryeon, Goryeok-jin-gun Hae-nyeong, or Ja-geum-cheon-gun, whom I learned about today.

However, after glimpsing his light just now, I realized one thing.

“You are not... a lord (君).”

Not a Jin-gun or a Cheon-gun.

“No, you were never...”

My eyes filled with blood. The true identity of Seo Hyul was laughable and absurd.

“You were never a Jinseon...! Right?”

Neither of us were Jinseon. Despite not being Jinseon, we had been absurdly recognizing each other as Jinseon-level beings and performing a ridiculous farce of pretending to be Jinseon.

Me, a Jinseon Dou? What a joke. He didn't see me as a Dou; he was desperately pretending to be Jinseon in front of me, a pitiful creature.

* * *

Jinryong Alliance of the Ji Tribe. Bongmyeongju. Hidden floor.

Crash—

One of the Jiangshi inside was grabbing the neck of the woman in white, Oh Hye-seo. The Jiangshi's face changed. His attire changed. The handsome man with blue hair and blue robes. The Jiangshi, who had transformed into Seo Hyul, spoke to Oh Hye-seo with a cold expression he had never shown before.

“What are you doing, Hye-seo?”

“Haha, why are you so upset, great lord? Are you angry because I peeked at your secret?”

“...I should thank you. Thanks to you, I remembered the feeling of displeasure after a long time.”

“That's great! You look more human now. Uhuhu...”

At that, Seo Hyul threw Oh Hye-seo away with a cold face.

“You, on the other hand, are inhuman despite being human.”

“Hmm, it makes me sad to hear that from you, great lord. Aren't we both the same, with human faces and beastly hearts?”

Seo Hyul, who had been staring at Oh Hye-seo for a moment, regained his usual smile.

“Huhu, I deliberately got rid of it, but it seems you never had it from the beginning, which is fascinating.”

“Aha, there's no way that's true. In this vast world, there must be others like me.”

“Huhu...”

The man with the mask and the woman who was nothing but a mask looked at each other with smiling faces.

“Anyway, this won't do. What just happened was a bit dangerous for me, so I need to give you some education this time.”

“Thank you for kindly letting me know that this method was effective.”

“Huhu...”

Seo Hyul reached out his hand towards Oh Hye-seo with a smiling face.

* * *

“Huhu...”

Still, that unpleasant laugh. Seo Hyul, looking at me through the bodies of other races. It was truly an unpleasant sight. But I pitied him as I looked at him.

I had seen a light in Seo Hyul's mental image before. I thought it was an illusion then. But now I knew. His mental image might have originally been like a paradise.

“Pitiful. Great lord of the Haeryong Tribe, Seo Hyul. How miserable it must have been to bury your original heart deep in the abyss and torment yourself.”

“...”

“Open your heart. If the wounds you suffered before are the problem, I have martial arts that can heal your heart.”

“...Huhu.”

Seo Hyul smiled faintly.

“You say amusing things, Seo Dou. What you just saw was merely a joke. There is no such thing as a heart in this world.”

“...Is that so.”

I looked straight into Seo Hyul's eyes and spoke.

Tap, crackle...

Gradually, Seo Hyul was being pushed out from within me, and the influence of 'something' he had seen was weakening, allowing my body, which had turned into salt, to regenerate.

“You're always smiling.”

“Huhu...”

He is a liar. His words, actions, face, even his heart, all turned into lies, a pitiful monster. Then what kind of lie is the smile that this monster always wears?

===

Author's Note: Seo Hyul might have just needed someone to talk to.... Breaking the character of Seo Hyul so that he no longer smiles will be the goal of Seo Eunhyun and me as we proceed with the Junggyeong episode. I really want to see Seo Hyul in despair.
