My name is (2)

"Damn it, what is 'Seolip'?" Huoguo asked, and I answered in a fluster. But after a moment of thought, I realized there couldn't be a more terrible name. I excluded the surname 'Won' because I was afraid Huoguo might know Wonlip if I answered 'Wonyu.' So I just said whatever came to mind, and it turned out to be the worst name.

"Damn it. I can't take it back now."

Whether he knew my thoughts or not, Huoguo laughed heartily and said, "Seolip! All the Seos are talented. I once tried to recruit a Seo into our sect but failed. He was an incredible talent."

"Haha... Is that so?" I laughed awkwardly, thinking I knew who he was talking about.

"Well, anyway, the Black Ghost Valley will continue to recruit more talents thanks to the newly established secret unit. For now... follow this child."

Woo-woo-woo―

As Huoguo waved his sleeve, a black ghost emerged from within.

"Take this one to the entrance."

Woo-woo―

The ghost nodded as if it understood and started flying somewhere.

"See you later. Follow it."

"Yes, sir."

After seeing Huoguo off, I followed the ghost he had summoned.

'So this is the Black Ghost Valley...'

It was my first time here, so I felt a sense of wonder. The valley was enormous, with countless narrow paths inside. The ghost skillfully navigated these paths to guide me.

After following the ghost for a while, I arrived in front of a small pavilion with the sign 'Entrance.'

The ghost beckoned me to follow, and I entered the pavilion.

"Whoa!"

Inside, I was startled by a strange sight. A white skeleton was sitting at a black wooden table, handling some paperwork. The skeleton exuded an aura that was just a step away from the Celestial Realm.

Though surprised, I remembered my first encounter with Songjin and spoke to the skeleton.

"Um..."

But before I could say anything, the ghost that had guided me flew to the skeleton's skull and seemed to whisper something. Their language was neither the language of the Yao tribe nor the common language of the Guanghan Realm. They didn't even use vocal cords, so I couldn't understand their language.

After some exchange, the skeleton looked at me and gestured. Soon, it spoke in a familiar common language.

"So, you came through the 13th secret unit?"

"Yes, that's correct."

"The 13th secret unit was just created, so it lacks many features. Normally, when someone ascends through a secret unit, we immediately track their origin. But the 13th unit doesn't have that function yet. So, I have to ask you directly."

The skeleton asked, with flames flickering in its eye sockets, "Which lower realm are you from?"

Seeing the flames, I realized it was a type of sensory technique similar to the 'Mystic Heart Mirror.'

'What an interesting technique.'

I controlled my thoughts and answered calmly, "It's called the Star Realm... a small star there."

"And the name of the star?"

"It was called Earth."

"You're from Earth too?"

The skeleton nodded and wrote something on a piece of paper. I thought of Kang Minhee and asked, "Are there others from Earth?"

The skeleton chuckled and said, "If you ask ascenders from the Star Realm where they're from, seven out of ten will say Earth. Do you think there's only one Earth in the Star Realm?"

"Oh..."

I was momentarily dumbfounded by a problem I hadn't considered.

"Anyway, it seems to be true, so let's move on. Once again, what's your name?"

"Seolip."

"Alright, Seolip. Gender?"

"I am..."

* * *

Paaaah!

I arrived at the human territory after flying for several days with Jeon Myunghun and Hongbeom.

"Are we heading straight to the Celestial Path?" Jeon Myunghun asked, and I shook my head.

"I'm going, but you two can't. You should go to the Thunder Spirit Path with Hongbeom and Yeonjin... and recover any remnants of the Golden Thunder Sect."

"You're going alone?"

"Yes. It's easier to escape alone if necessary."

Jeon Myunghun nodded. "Alright, see you later. If you escape, where should we meet?"

"Come to the Light Spirit Land in the Cold Spirit Tribe's territory. We'll meet there."

After making our promise, we parted ways. I flew quickly and arrived at the Celestial Path. The Celestial Path, being the headquarters of the human alliance, had the strongest barrier of any celestial realm. Due to the injuries of the fusion stage elders, the barrier was even stronger than usual. There were also checkpoints that weren't there before.

"Hey, Celestial Path guard! To enter the Celestial Path, you need a pass and a reason..."

I glanced at the Celestial Path guard and ignored him, drawing my Colorless Glass Sword and summoning the Three-Tai Chi behind me.

Booom!

A hole was blown in the barrier. I passed the stunned Celestial Path guard and headed to a specific place in the Celestial Path.

Celestial Path, Celestial Mountain. It was where the seven fusion stage elders usually resided.

'There are nine fusion stage elders in the human alliance.'

The fusion stage elder of the Black Dragon Tribe, Black Dragon King Hyun Eum. The master of Bongrae Palace and the Star Lord of Geon Gon, early fusion stage Hyeonwon. The leader of the human alliance, fusion stage elder Junje. The inspector of the entire human race, early fusion stage Wilyeongseon. The master of Gaejin Sect, mid-fusion stage Gaejin. The master of Yeoncheon Palace, mid-fusion stage Eungyeon. The chief military officer of the human alliance, early fusion stage Wisu. The late fusion stage elder from Sansu, Golmaek. The mysterious fusion stage elder Taeyeoljeon.

These were the nine elders supporting the human alliance. However, Taeyeoljeon rarely attended the elders' meetings, and the Black Dragon King, being from the Black Dragon Tribe, was only treated as an ally and didn't participate in human meetings. Therefore, the human alliance was essentially run by Junje, Wisu, Wilyeongseon, Hyeonwon, Golmaek, Eungyeon, and Gaejin.

I flew towards Celestial Mountain, increasing my speed to meet them. In the distance, I saw Celestial Mountain, shrouded in white spiritual energy. It was the residence of the fusion stage elders. But as I tried to enter Celestial Mountain...

'...?'

Something was wrong. No matter how much I flew, the distance to Celestial Mountain didn't decrease.

'This...'

I realized I had passed the same place again.

'Am I going in circles?'

It wasn't a problem with my sense of direction. My senses were fine. There was only one explanation.

'The space is distorted.'

The space was twisted like a barrier to prevent intruders. The way to cross such a space was simple. By using the space-folding technique that only fusion stage elders and above could use, one could fold the space and move through it. However, although I had the power of a fusion stage, I could only use celestial stage techniques. My abilities couldn't straighten the twisted space. So, what should I do?

'If all I have is strength, then I'll use strength.'

It was a simple logic. I gripped the Colorless Glass Sword tightly. Raising the sword with all my might, I slashed down. The twisted space was caught in my senses. The dimensions were wildly distorted.

Kwakakakakak!

The space tore apart, and the twisted space opened a path. I calmly entered the area where the dragon veins of Celestial Mountain flowed and arrived at Celestial Mountain. As I reached the front of Celestial Mountain...

Pabababat!

Six projections blocked my way. They were the projections of all the elders except for the mysterious Taeyeoljeon and Hyeonwon, who resided in Geon Gon Star. A familiar face spoke to me. It was Wilyeongseon.

"How dare you set foot in Celestial Mountain, the sacred ground of the human alliance."

I grinned and said, "I wish to receive a title from Celestial Mountain, so I seek the permission of the elders."

Their eyes twitched at my words.

"You know the conditions for receiving a title from Celestial Mountain, right?"

"Yes. Either be a fusion stage elder or borrow the name of a super-large force equivalent to the six great sects of the human race. I know it's one of the two."

"You know well. But you are not an elder, just a celestial stage cultivator."

"Hmm..."

I smirked and said, "I don't seek the title as an elder."

"Then what is it?"

"I claim that I, as an individual, am equivalent to the six great sects of the human race."

The elders were momentarily stunned by my arrogant statement. Wilyeongseon spoke again.

"Arrogant."

"Is that so?"

"Do you know that Hyeonwon has placed a bounty on you again? Bongrae Palace has offered a large reward, and your crimes are clear. You are guilty of escaping from the secret unit."

"Well, I have already registered my name in the records of the Golden Thunder Sect and the Destiny Path. So why should I be bound by the secret unit?"

"That's the procedure. Even if you descend to the lower realm and ascend again, the procedure is necessary. And you descended without notifying the alliance, which is also a crime. Moreover, you hindered the conquest of the True Demon Realm by hiding the Spirit Land there for years. These are serious crimes."

"Is that so."

"Furthermore, you trespassed into Celestial Mountain, where the elders' meeting is held today... Your crimes are too many. Even talking to you is an act of mercy."

I smiled slightly at Wilyeongseon's threatening words. After entering the realm of the gods, I could somewhat see the intentions behind their words, even if they were just projections. I read the intentions of the other elders and understood why they were treating me this way.

'I see.'

Gaining more confidence from their intentions, I spoke to Wilyeongseon.

"Then don't show mercy. Make me pay for my crimes."

"What...?"

"Make me pay for my crimes."

Wilyeongseon stared at me for a moment. Our standoff continued for a while. None of them attacked me first.

'It seems the damage from the Lord of Heavenly Punishment was significant.'

Normally, they would have come down in person instead of threatening with projections. At that moment, the leader of the human alliance and the head of the elders' meeting, fusion stage elder Junje, stepped forward and spoke.

"Inspector Wilyeongseon, arrest Seoeunhyun. If he is captured, we will hold an immediate trial and make him pay for his crimes."

At those words, Wilyeongseon disappeared from the spot with a grim face.

'Ho...'

Shortly after Wilyeongseon's projection disappeared, the space split open, and a man wearing a white mask emerged from the other side.

'Wilyeongseon, the real body!'

Kugugugugu!

An overwhelming pressure crushed me. At the same time, the other five elders' projections flew into the air and reached out to somewhere. Simultaneously, the surrounding space began to 'expand' suddenly. A stage was set for a showdown between Wilyeongseon and me. I felt his gaze from behind the mask. To provoke him, I said, "Your aura feels like that of a celestial stage. Are you in much pain? Are your joints aching?"

Wilyeongseon, who had been staring at me, smiled.

"Indeed, I suffered a fatal injury after facing the one who descended to Thunder Spirit Path. My condition is terrible."

'He admits it so easily?'

As I was slightly surprised, Wilyeongseon continued.

"Do you know why I, among us, stepped forward despite my condition?"

"Why don't you enlighten me?"

At my words, Wilyeongseon reached out to the sky. At the same time, I was startled and stepped back, sensing the energy from far away.

Kugugugugu!

From a great distance, an immense energy was being transmitted to this place.

Paaaah!

Hundreds of beams of light shot down from the sky. I traced the closest beam to find out where it was coming from.

'Wilyeongseon's clone!'

Wilyeongseon had dispatched his clones throughout the human territory to monitor the entire human race. Among them, three clones were stationed in the Celestial Path due to its vast size. These three clones were currently merging with the dragon veins of the Celestial Path, transmitting their power to Wilyeongseon's main body. The other beams were likely the same. The clones dispatched to the celestial realms were melting the dragon veins and transmitting their power to him.

Kugugugugu!

I marveled at Wilyeongseon, who was receiving the power of the dragon veins from all the celestial realms. His aura, which had been at the celestial stage, was rapidly rising. In the next moment...

Booom!

Surrounded by a technique, he charged at me with a seven-colored fan in hand.

Kwarururururu!

Flames erupted everywhere. The expanded space was instantly engulfed in a sea of seven-colored fire. I summoned the Three-Tai Chi.

In the next moment...

Kwaaang!

My Colorless Glass Sword pierced through Wilyeongseon's mouth. He seemed shocked, as if he hadn't noticed. I glared at him as he continued to charge his energy.

Kwaaang!

I struck him sideways, sending him flying. I grinned, baring my teeth.

Kwaaang!

I kicked off the air and charged at Wilyeongseon in the frozen world. He wasn't a fusion stage elder by luck. He used a technique to move swiftly in the frozen world. However, he was slow.

Booom!

Flash!

I slashed his upper body with the Colorless Glass Sword, which was imbued with an invisible blade. I then struck him a hundred and six times. But he couldn't even react. The four pillars of power—heaven, earth, heart, and anomaly—supplied me with volcanic energy. I amplified my power through General Seo's circuit and pressed him further. Eventually, he lost the ability to speak and focused on following my attacks with his eyes. At some point...

Paaaah!

Gathering his energy, Wilyeongseon used a faster technique and moved far ahead. He was now 2,000 li away. I extended the invisible blade towards him. The blade surged like lightning, but the distance reduced its power transmission. Wilyeongseon, who had withstood my attack, began forming hand seals.

'Now it begins.'

Simultaneously, countless clones emerged from Wilyeongseon's shadow. Each clone was at the celestial stage, filling the area around him.

'Huh, even if it's a technique and only for short-term use...'

The unstable clones would disappear soon. But when the number of celestial stage clones exceeded 300 million, I couldn't help but laugh.

Kugugugugu!

The clones spread out and began forming hand seals.

'They're setting up a formation.'

Single Sword Technique. Layered Mountains.

Kugugugugu!

The invisible blade extended in all directions, becoming a massive thorn bush that could split mountains. The clones began to burst under the onslaught of the invisible blade. But it didn't end there. I summoned all 3,000 Colorless Glass Swords and spread them in the air. The invisible blade imbued the Colorless Glass Swords. Wilyeongseon's clones began forming more clones. And those clones formed more clones. The clones gathered and set up formations. The formations amplified their power.

Single Sword Technique. Three Thousand Lights and One Peak.

Kugugugugu!

3,000 Colorless Glass Swords. Each imbued with an invisible blade, extended 3,000 invisible blades. 9 million blades swept the front. The clones burst under the onslaught. Single Sword Technique. Strange Rock. The 9 million blades scattered and gathered, sweeping the clones. Paaaah! One of the clones flew at me, reaching out. I sent a blade to burst the clone. At that moment...

Pabat!

Wilyeongseon swapped places with the clone. He swung the seven-colored fan at me.

Kwarurururu!

Flames hotter than lava melted the ground and surged at me. I quickly charged at him, swinging my hand. But Wilyeongseon had already swapped places with another clone.

'Annoying.'

If this continued, it would be a game of tag.

'I'll sweep them all away.'

Single Sword Technique. Single Sword!

Kugugugugu!

3,000 Colorless Glass Swords, imbued with the invisible blade, unleashed the Single Sword technique. 3,000 Single Swords filled the space, sweeping everything. Light flickered, and Wilyeongseon's clones vanished. At that moment...

Kuuuuuu!

I noticed the energy from the clones' formation converging at one point. That's where the main body is! As I directed my attack there...

Kuuuuuu!

Wilyeongseon began to unfold his domain. His domain quickly enveloped me, and I found myself in a world filled with colorful masks. Flash! A mask next to me transformed into Wilyeongseon and charged at me. Kugugugugu! The seven-colored fan he held turned red, then yellow, then white, then blue. Blue flames surged at me. These flames were far stronger than the previous ones. I bared my teeth and reached out.

Kwak!

I pierced through the flames and grabbed Wilyeongseon, sensing his surprise. I slashed at him, but he swapped places with a clone. My blade burst the clone and pierced his domain.

Kwaaang!

Just as the dimensional barrier of the Water Realm crumpled under my blade, Wilyeongseon's domain crumpled under a single strike. 'The dimensional barrier of a celestial stage elder was like cutting through water...' The domain of a fusion stage elder was different. It was a dimensional barrier itself! I tore through Wilyeongseon's dimensional barrier, laughing. His domain was filled with the emotions of pain. Wilyeongseon's clones charged at me. In the domain, each clone was at the early fusion stage, using fusion stage techniques. But...

Kwaang, Kwaaang!

With each strike, Wilyeongseon's domain crumpled. Kwaaang! With another strike, the domain tore apart. Jjeoong! With the third strike, countless clones exploded, and a hole was punched in the dimensional barrier-like domain. I continued to strike the world itself. I cut through countless clones, gradually heading towards Wilyeongseon's main body. He swapped places with clones, fleeing within the domain. He sent blue flames at me from afar, but I was getting closer. Single Sword Technique. Moving
