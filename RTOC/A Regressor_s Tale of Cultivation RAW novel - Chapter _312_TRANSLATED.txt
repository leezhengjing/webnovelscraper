I approached her with a trembling voice. It was then. Blink— A large eye suddenly appeared where I was heading and shone on me. Instinctively, I knew it belonged to Kang Minhee. At that moment, the narrow path I was standing on widened. And then, a familiar voice echoed.

“What are you doing here?”

“Huh…!?”

When I came to my senses, I found myself on a cloud bathed in golden sunset light.

“This place….”

As I stammered in confusion, I realized that my voice was coming out instead of my spiritual energy. When I turned around at the sound of someone’s presence, Kang Minhee was sitting on the cloud.

“Domain…?”

Only then did I understand why Kang Minhee, who was on the path to the Mingui Realm, appeared in front of me heading towards the Guanghan Realm. No matter where I went, I ended up heading towards the Guanghan Realm. Kang Minhee had reached the Fusion Stage in just over 300 years and twisted space with her power. And the attire of Kang Minhee, who invited me into her unique domain, was not the familiar black robe of the Heukseokgwigolgok, but a business suit from Earth.

Seeing Kang Minhee revealing Earth’s culture in front of me, I hurriedly touched my face.

“Oh. What….”

“I regained my memories. As expected, you sealed your memories and even transformed into something resembling a woman to stalk me. Really disgusting, Seo Eunhyun.”

“No, that wasn’t my intention…. No, more than that, Seorip is not exactly a woman….”

As I stammered in confusion, she took out a familiar liquid electronic cigarette from her pocket and laughed.

“I’m joking. Even though it was annoying to regain my memories, I wasn’t really angry.”

“…”

“Oh, but it was really disgusting. No matter the circumstances, it was extremely perverted and creepy.”

I broke out in a cold sweat. The karma of staying by her side in the body of Won Yoo had come back to haunt me.

“Ah… I can’t remember the taste from the old days…. Even though I roughly remember….”

She took a puff from her electronic cigarette and waved her hand. At the same time, the earthly items she enjoyed turned into illusions, scattered, and were absorbed into the clouds. Her clothes also transformed back into the black robe of the Heukseokgwigolgok that she originally wore.

I looked around Kang Minhee’s unique domain. Not knowing what to say, I decided to compliment the scenery.

“…It’s beautiful. Here….”

“Hmm….”

But Kang Minhee glared at me with a sidelong glance at my words.

“Don’t you remember this scene?”

“Huh, what?”

“Even though the clouds up to where we’re standing are a bit of my romantic touch, the rest of the scenery is what we saw together. Too much, isn’t it?”

“No, that’s not….”

‘Damn it. The Mansang Inyeondo is with the main body…!’

I gritted my teeth and broke out in a cold sweat. Seeing my flustered state, Kang Minhee burst into laughter.

“It’s fun to tease you. It feels like all my gloom has flown away.”

“You, really….”

We exchanged trivial chatter for a while. Once the atmosphere had somewhat relaxed, I cautiously asked.

“…Why didn’t you return from the path?”

“Well, I found out that my ex-boyfriend had turned into a bizarre body that was neither male nor female and was stalking me within the sect. It was terrifying.”

“…”

“I’m joking. Well, that’s part of it, maybe about 0.1 percent. The rest is….”

Kang Minhee walked over to me and swept the nearby clouds. As she did, the sound of children’s laughter echoed from somewhere.

“To comfort these kids.”

“…!”

Only then did I realize that the surrounding clouds were not just clouds. They were not clouds at all. Each grain that looked like a cloud was a ghost!

“…I’ve never died, so I don’t know well. But do you know what I always hear when I communicate with ghosts?”

“…”

“It’s ‘I’m sad.’ These kids are always sad. About losing their lives, about dying, about the things they couldn’t achieve….”

Kang Minhee squatted down and swept the ghosts with her hand.

“There’s nothing to do on the path. At such times, I read books brought from the Guanghan Realm or practice the Ghost Dao Techniques. Practicing the Ghost Dao Techniques might sound funny, but it’s about listening to these kids’ stories. As I listen to their stories, my spiritual power fills up….”

She continued.

“Do you know how many stories I’ve listened to?”

“…How many?”

“I don’t know! Really… countless. I kept listening to their stories. And… at some point, I had this thought.”

She smiled faintly. Somehow, I felt I had seen that smile before.

—I want to work for this company. I will think about what I can do for this company. I will do my best to work for this company.

“I want to use my strength for these kids. I want to find out what I can do for them. If possible… I want to find out the best I can do for them.”

I remembered watching her interview from the side. Yes, I knew she was a strong person when I saw her confident demeanor.

“I had a tough childhood too. So… I want to do something for these kids who had a tough death. If there’s a reason we gained this power, it must be a revelation to use it for someone.”

Indeed, she was still strong. Only those who are truly strong can use their power for the weak.

“…So, that’s why you didn’t return?”

“Hehe, you talk just like my ex-boyfriend. Really.”

“No….”

“The reason I didn’t return to the Heukseokgwigolgok is… I decided to leave it.”

“What…?”

I asked in surprise. Kang Minhee smiled and answered confidently.

“I confirmed that my ex-boyfriend had sneaked in, and more importantly… you know the Heukseokgwigolgok is only kind to its own members, right?”

“That’s true, but….”

“And it’s too harsh on rival sects or enemies.”

Her eyes darkened.

“They always fill the harbor where the Seopmyeongham is docked with ghost water made from countless vengeful spirits. You’ve seen it too, right? And when Heukseokgwigolgok disciples die, they either resurrect them or turn them into ghost souls to continue training. If a disciple above the Wonyoung stage dies, they are enshrined as ghost kings and treated well in the grand mausoleum. But… if they get their hands on the souls of rival sects or enemies, they always refine them into treasures, absorb them for spiritual power, or turn them into ghost spirits to control them.”

That was true. Although they treated their own members well, the essence of Heukseokgwigolgok was demonic. Techniques like the Bihonjinmagong consumed vengeful spirits to convert them into spiritual power, and the Sishikbirebon was even worse. They at least helped part of the soul go to the underworld, but that was it. The souls captured by Heukseokgwigolgok were harshly exploited until they were useless and only then allowed to rest.

“I’m going to leave Heukseokgwigolgok. I’ll leave and liberate all the souls captured by Heukseokgwigolgok, comfort them, and guide them to the afterlife. That’s the goal I set while listening to these kids’ stories.”

“…”

“You’ll keep it a secret, right, ex-boyfriend?”

Kang Minhee asked with a sly smile. I nodded with a heavy heart. She was undergoing closed-door training. If she turned the Heukseokgwigolgok and the five great sects of the human race into enemies, the repercussions would be enormous, so she was trying to raise her level before leaving.

“…How far do you plan to raise your level?”

“My goal is to reach the peak of the Fusion Stage. The Wall of the Shattering Stage is too high, and I can’t see how to reach it, so I set a realistic goal.”

‘I see….’

Her talk about her ex-boyfriend was half a joke. But her determination to liberate the souls from the demonic sect Heukseokgwigolgok was real. Only then did I realize the true reason she became the Ghost Dao Saintess.

‘In her past life, too, she kept… kept trying to….’

She had constantly used her strength to liberate the souls. And when the pain of the souls flooded into her already fractured mind, she couldn’t endure it and went berserk.

“Anyway. My goal is to raise my level so high that no ghost or soul can be seen before my eyes. That’s the goal I set.”

“…”

I felt there was something she wasn’t telling me. But seeing the fleeting thoughts, I couldn’t bring myself to ask what she was hiding. I just looked at her with a determined face.

“…If you accept so many ghosts, won’t it affect your mind?”

“Well… I hate to admit it, but that thing you stuck in me. It worked well. My mind is clear. Thanks to that, I don’t think you need to worry.”

It was as she said. Originally, I intended to use the Euihae Eunsan to alleviate any potential mental issues she might have. But in my eyes, she had no mental issues. Although I couldn’t use the Intangible Sword, I still had the vivid vision of the Geomcheon. Her mind was clear and healthy, without a speck of trouble.

‘Thanks to the Bongryeonghyo….’

At least for now, there seemed to be no worry of her awakening as the Ghost Dao Saintess. I smiled faintly.

“…That’s a relief.”

Thanks to her, I had come all the way to the distant Sapung Station, leaving behind the intact Heukseokgwigolgok branch, and even created another path. But I had no regrets. Just seeing that Kang Minhee was fine made the trip worthwhile.

“…Then I’ll go. I just came to check if you were okay.”

“Hehe, you didn’t come because you missed me?”

“Think whatever you want.”

“I’ll really think whatever I want.”

“Sure.”

I turned around and threw the Gwigol I made from my soul at her.

“It’s a part of my soul. If you think there’s a problem, contact me immediately.”

Through the Gwigol’s spell, I could use the Euihae Eunsan remotely if she had any issues. It was a piece I left in case she awakened as the Ghost Dao Saintess. As soon as Kang Minhee received my soul fragment, she threw it into a random cloud and turned her back.

“Okay. Go. I won’t see you off. And remember, keep the secret.”

“Sure.”

I walked in the opposite direction, and at some point, I was out of Kang Minhee’s domain.

‘This place….’

Before I knew it, I was on the upper path. And the giant ghostly body of Kang Minhee, which had been beside me, had disappeared. It seemed she had distorted space and vanished elsewhere. I wandered around for a while and finally found the path we had first connected to Kang Minhee’s path. After waiting there for a few days, I saw Heo Gwak and Heo Ryeong rushing towards me. I was surprised by their words and asked again. I pretended to be surprised and stood still. Heo Ryeong gritted his teeth and returned with me the way we came. We exited the path. I came out to the Guanghan Realm, released the Ghost King Transformation, and looked back at the path.

‘Hang in there, Kang Minhee.’

Kim Younghoon sought return. Jeon Myunghoon and Kim Yeon sought revenge. Kang Minhee sought salvation. Oh Hyunseok sought peace. Oh Hyeso… well, she would live well on her own. Anyway, everyone had their own goals. As long as Kang Minhee didn’t collapse, I intended to support her goal. I exited the Ghost Soul Pavilion of the Seopmyeongham, which led to the path. It was then.

Ziiing—

—You suffered so much from fate, and you’re just going to leave like that.

—You should have made sure Kang Minhee’s mind was more stable before leaving.

Suddenly, I felt a voice echoing from deep within my mind, which had been closed for a long time.

“…?”

I stood still and listened, but the voice didn’t come again. It seemed to be a hallucination created by my lingering feelings for Kang Minhee. I must have had quite a bit of lingering feelings for her without realizing it.

* * *

In the domain of clouds dyed in sunset light, Kang Minhee picked up Seo Eunhyun’s soul fragment, clenched it tightly, and smoked her pipe.

“…Hey. That was a lie.”

There was something she hadn’t told Seo Eunhyun. About her shadow. And her hatred for herself, who mistook the shadow for Seo Eunhyun….

The 0.1 percent influence of Seo Eunhyun was a lie. Along with that hatred. To never mistake him for a ghost again. To never mistake him for something like a ghost again, she decided to guide all the souls to the underworld.

“If you had said you missed me… maybe… none of this would have been necessary.”

She clenched Seo Eunhyun’s Gwigol tightly. As soon as she held the Gwigol, the weak sealing spell she had cast on it was released. The Gwigol couldn’t hear her words. Kang Minhee muttered softly to the Gwigol.

“…You idiot.”

Perhaps the two of them missed each other. But maybe they parted ways for each other’s sake. For each other. For each other’s sake. The meeting of the two, who had been running towards different goals, ended in a miss. Now, all that was left was to leap towards their respective goals. After they parted ways again, 100 years passed.

* * *

“…The Jeomuldo of the Jungnyongjin has opened.”

I succeeded in building one axis through the Budeokjesaseo.

Wooong!

I felt my lifespan increase by another ten thousand years.

Rumble….

I felt the heavenly tribulation pass over me and looked up at the sky. Having built one axis from the no-axis stage, I had reached the mid-stage of the Four-Axis Stage.

‘Enter the Jeomuldo of the Jungnyongjin, help the Heukrineoryeongmun, and receive a reward from them.’

And with the reward, I would create a small mysterious fortress for Kim Yeon.

‘The reason Seo Hyul feared the Gwaegun was that if he became a puppet of the mysterious fortress, he would surely die.’

I was confident I could reach the Fusion Stage within the remaining 500 years. If Kang Minhee also overcame her hurdle and reached the Fusion Stage, we would join forces to capture Seo Hyul, who had taken over the main body, and transform him. Then, using the small mysterious fortress, we would gradually replace his soul with an artificial one and kill him. No matter how strong Seo Hyul was, he would have no choice but to die. That was my plan to kill Seo Hyul.
