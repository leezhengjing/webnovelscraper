My Name Is (4)

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

The entire space shakes.

I realized that the curse on the vine I was holding was connected to the formation spread throughout this space.

As the curse reversed, the formation, which had been intricately tailored to the curse, began to shake violently.

Whoosh!

The withered thorny vines began to wriggle wildly, and new shoots started to sprout from various parts of the thorns.

And after a while, dazzling white flowers bloomed from within the new shoots.

Then, in an instant.

Boom!

A brilliant light spread in all directions, scattering white petals everywhere as the thorny vines vanished without a trace.

With it, the formation in the space seemed to disintegrate, and before I knew it, we were inside a small cave about three zhang in radius.

In front of us, Baekjin was kneeling and staggering.

“Ugh! How... How could you use an extreme righteous technique with the property of exorcism (降魔) while also mastering demonic arts!? Even if you learned exorcism techniques, you wouldn’t be able to break this formation without understanding the curse…”

It seemed that he was directly linked to the formation.

Baekjin was staggering, spewing a white breath from his mouth.

I smiled slyly and said, “When you reach the pinnacle of extreme demonic arts (極魔), the path to transcending demonic arts (脫魔) also becomes visible.”

“Kuh, kuhuhu… Are you saying that wasn't an extreme righteous technique? Well… I understand. But remember one thing.”

He looked at me with flames rising from his eyes.

“In the Black Ghost Valley, the majority of practitioners train in demonic arts, so using exorcism techniques is strictly prohibited. This is your first time, and since no one told you, I’ll let it slide… but be careful in the future.”

“Understood. So, are we disqualified for using that technique just now?”

“Hehehe, of course not. You... passed with the highest score….”

Rustle!

“…!”

I was startled.

Baekjin's body began to crumble into white powder.

Gradually, his voice turned into an eerie whisper, echoing through the space.

[You have succeeded in killing the examiner… From now on, you are all Yin Soul (陰魂) disciples. Since I died so absurdly… the following procedures will be guided by… this entity….]
Rustle!

After saying that, Baekjin swung his sleeve, releasing a ghost, and then crumbled to death.

I stood there, dumbfounded.

‘Did he just die?’

It was so casual that it seemed like he was just going to take a nap.

However, unlike my confusion, the other disciples were looking at me with eyes full of respect.

“Amazing, Senior. To kill the examiner….”

“The entrance examiners of the Black Ghost Valley are known to be stronger than those of the same realm, and you killed one who was at the threshold of the Heavenly Will realm in one strike….”

“I was rude earlier. I apologize.”

Their manner of speaking, fundamentally different from mine, made me feel dizzy.

At that moment.

[All five of you, follow me. I will distribute the Yin Soul disciple badges.]
A ghost emitting black energy spoke to us from the sleeve Baekjin had swung.

“…Let’s all receive our identity badges first.”

I hid my confusion and followed the ghost.

The ghost led us back the way we came.

‘Are we going back to the entrance?’

As I followed the ghost, I carefully asked it a question.

“Am I going to be punished for killing the guardian of the Black Ghost Valley?”

[No. Da-in Baekjin died because his training was insufficient. You don’t need to worry.]
“But… didn’t the sect’s strength decrease?”

[Ah… Da-in Seolip, you must have ascended, so you might not know about the Black Ghost Valley’s affairs.]
At the ghost's words, the other four showed expressions of shock.

“Ascended? You ascended?”

“How did you break through the spatial pressure with a mortal body….”

“I heard there are terrifying monsters in the void space…?”

“Amazing. Could you tell us about your ascension experience?”

In the sects I had entered so far, there hadn’t been many direct encounters with disciples from the Bright Heaven Realm, and the sect itself was a group that ascended together, so they didn’t care much about individual ascenders.

But it seemed they highly regarded individual ascension in the Bright Heaven Realm.

Especially for someone like me who ascended with a mortal body.

I thought about what to say and decided to give a short answer to avoid a long explanation.

“We’ll talk about it later.”

After saying that, I waited for the ghost's answer.

Why were they so nonchalant about me killing Baekjin?

Then, the ghost’s words left me in shock.

“From the ghost disciples (鬼魂) of the Black Ghost Valley onward, you are granted two chances to revive (復活) within the valley. Using the Soul Containment Box (섭명함) or the special grand formation of the valley makes it easy. Of course, the higher your realm, the more resources it takes, so those above the Black Elder have to revive on their own….”

“…!!!”

‘They offer revival chances?’

I was stunned by how casually the ghost mentioned it.

‘And if the Soul Containment Box has revival capabilities….’

I finally understood why Gwaegun had stolen the power source of the Soul Containment Box.

With its power source, the Soul Containment Box was a divine artifact with revival functions.

‘But, considering her condition, there must be limits.’

As I was bewildered, the bald tattooed man smiled warmly and said,

“You didn’t know, Senior? It makes sense if you ascended. Among the five great human sects, except for the Black Ghost Valley, all have support from Composite Stage Masters or Dragon Kings. One reason why the Black Ghost Valley, without a Composite Stage Master, is one of the five great sects is its extreme immortality (不死性).”

“Immortality… Isn’t it common among demonic beasts who practice demonic arts?”

“I don’t mean strong regeneration. The demonic beasts of the Black Ghost Valley are famous for their incredibly tenacious lifespans. Firstly, within the valley, practitioners in the small realm are given two internal revival chances—one through the grand formation and one through the Soul Containment Box. Furthermore, by learning a few special techniques of the Black Ghost Valley, even if their revival chances are exhausted, they can revive as corpses (屍), and if they die again, they can revive by taking over another’s body. Continuing this way, if they finally can’t revive anymore, they can be sealed as ghost kings (鬼王) in a shrine inside the Soul Containment Box to continue their existence. As ghost kings, they become even harder to kill, and even if killed, there are techniques to remain in the world as residual souls (盞魂), making death itself nearly impossible.”

“….”

Listening to him, I couldn’t help but be shocked.

‘Compared to them, Wonrip was a saint.’

The bald tattooed man was clearly an outsider trying to enter the Black Ghost Valley.

This meant that even outsiders knew about the numerous revival chances, comparable to those of Wonrip.

Considering the additional personal revival items the elders and seniors might possess, it was likely they could revive not seven but more than fourteen times.

And amidst such thoughts, I realized a terrifying truth.

‘Does that mean Gwaegun annihilated a third of the Black Ghost Valley despite these insane revival chances…?’

He had crushed all those revival chances and destroyed the Soul Containment Box.

‘That’s insane….’

Thinking of Songjin, who remained as a residual soul, I trembled at the thought of how many times he must have been killed by Gwaegun.

[Indeed. The history of our Black Ghost Valley is said to be older than that of the Bright Heaven Realm. With the Bright Heaven Realm's history being about 490,000 years, the accumulated history, power, and pride of our valley over such a long time are truly great.]
“…It seems so.”

I followed the ghost to the entrance hall and inscribed my name on the dark blue badge it handed out.

Looking at the dark blue jade badge inscribed with ‘Seolip,’ I felt a mix of emotions.

[Now, follow me. I will assign you all to the Eastern Division and give an introduction to the sect.]
The ghost led us deep into the Black Ghost Valley.

The closer we got to the center, the denser the ghostly energy became, and the ghost guiding us became more distinct.

He was a boy in a black robe.

Noticing our gazes, he spoke.

[Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. I am Eupyeon. In life, I was a disciple of the Smoke Technique in the Black Ghost Valley. A hundred years ago, I died in an attack by the Yin Ghost Demon Sect, and my master, Da-in Baekjin, took me in. Now, as a ghost, I serve as a guide at the entrance hall.]
“…I see. Is being dead… not painful?”

[It was painful and terrifying when I died, but I’ve grown used to it. Besides, my master treats me well, so it’s fine.]
I found the Black Ghost Valley’s unique attitude toward death peculiar.

‘Strange. They aren’t afraid of death but rather familiar with it….’

Following Eupyeon, I reached a cliff deep in the valley.

“This is….”

[This is where the pride of the Black Ghost Valley, the Soul Containment Box, is docked!]
Looking down the cliff,

 there was a massive source of ghostly energy.

Two Soul Containment Boxes were floating above a black water, emitting immense ghostly energy.

Upon closer inspection, the black water wasn’t actual water but an aggregation of countless souls.

I frowned at the sight.

Unlike Eupyeon, these souls were all in torment.

Seeing me frown, Eupyeon pointed down.

[The Eastern Division is below. Follow me.]
We followed Eupyeon down and were assigned to quarters in the cliff.

“Hehe, the ghostly energy here is perfect for training demonic arts.”

“As expected of the Black Ghost Valley!”

“Hihihi….”

The corpse-like man and the bald tattooed man admired the Eastern Division, while the woman in white giggled eerily as if her madness had returned.

Huh Nam-gwon also seemed very pleased, absorbing the ghostly energy and humming.

[This is Seolip Da-in’s quarters.]
I, too, was assigned a place near the Soul Containment Box with dense ghostly energy.

[Follow me. Now that you’ve been assigned quarters, we must go greet the elders of the sect.]
We followed Eupyeon into the Soul Containment Box.

As I entered the familiar interior, I recalled the past.

Rumble!

The Soul Containment Box seemed alive, with ghostly energy flowing throughout.

‘It’s like a moving dragon vein.’

An intact Soul Containment Box was like a moving spiritual mountain.

After a while, we reached a shrine deep inside the Soul Containment Box.

[Disciple Eupyeon greets the elders.]
Screech!

Simultaneously, an incomprehensible ghostly wail erupted from the shrine.

The immense ghostly wail and energy froze the corpse-like man, made the bald tattooed man stand at attention, and caused the woman in white to cower in fear, seemingly cured of her madness.

Huh Nam-gwon hid behind me, trembling.

But I merely chuckled softly.

‘What a display of excitement.’

The shrine was filled with the welcoming joy of new disciples.

Indeed, Eupyeon explained that the elders inside the shrine, the ghost kings (鬼王) of the Black Ghost Valley, were welcoming us.

We stood before the wailing shrine, following Eupyeon’s lead in bowing and completing the simple entrance ceremony.

[The entrance ceremony is now complete. You are now proud Yin Soul disciples of the Black Ghost Valley.]
Eupyeon clapped, congratulating us, and the bald tattooed man wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.

“Th-thank you.”

He seemed eager to leave the shrine quickly.

But contrary to his hopes, Eupyeon smiled as if to say something.

At that moment.

“Is the entrance ceremony over?”

Whoosh!

The space split as Baekgol Gwima Heo Gwak entered from the shrine.

With an androgynous appearance, he smiled at us, then squinted at Huh Nam-gwon.

Then, seeing me, his eyes lit up.

“Well, it seems everyone has entered well. You know who I am, right? I am Baekgol Gwima Heo Gwak, the head elder of the Black Ghost Valley’s Bright Heaven Branch.”

We bowed to him in respect.

“Usually, disciples below ghost souls are assigned a master, but for Yin Soul disciples with mortal energy, we use a slightly different method. You will now choose the ghost king (鬼王) you will serve.”

“W-what?”

Already pale from the ghost kings’ energy, the bald tattooed man turned even paler and asked.

Heo Gwak smiled and said,

“In the Black Ghost Valley, we typically choose at least one ghost companion. Unlike regular companions, the purpose is to train in ghost techniques, not dual cultivation. Since the purpose is different, gender doesn’t matter, and everyone has at least one ghost companion. But you newly inducted Yin Soul disciples have mortal energy, which isn’t suitable for ghost techniques.”

Hearing Heo Gwak’s continued explanation, the bald tattooed man looked as if he might faint.

“So, until you choose your ghost companion, you will serve one of the ghost kings in this shrine, letting your soul become accustomed to ghostly energy.”

The bald tattooed man looked dazed, as if half his soul had left him.

But the corpse-like man and the woman in white looked pleased, and Huh Nam-gwon seemed slightly annoyed.

“Elder, do I also have to….”

Huh Nam-gwon asked, and Heo Gwak, looking irritated, waved his hand.

“It’s the procedure. You are no exception.”

“Yes….”

“Now, go to the memorial tablets in the shrine.”

We walked towards the endless line of memorial tablets in the shrine.

Then.

Whoosh!

Suddenly, the scenery changed.

I found myself separated from the others, surrounded by countless tombstones under a pitch-black night sky.

The tombstones were all neatly inscribed.

Under the dark sky.

Heo Gwak’s voice echoed from the void.

[You have entered the grand graveyard (大墓域) of the Black Ghost Valley, accessible only through the shrine in the Soul Containment Box or by special means. Countless ancestors, now ghost kings, reside there. Wander around, and if a ghost king takes a liking to you, surrender yourself. The ghost king who chooses you will determine the type of ghost techniques you will learn, so try to make a good impression.]
With that, Heo Gwak’s voice ceased, and I waited for a moment before looking around.

“Hmm….”

No matter how much I looked around, I couldn’t sense the presence of any ghost kings.

“Is anyone here?”

I wandered the grand graveyard, searching between the tombstones.

But there wasn’t even a trace of a ghost king, not even a lowly ghost.

“…Where are the ghost kings?”

***

The Black Ghost Valley’s grand graveyard.

In another part of it.

Huh Nam-gwon, the bald tattooed man, the corpse-like man, and the woman in white.

Everyone except Seolip was seeing the same scene.

Amid the grand graveyard, they were forced to collapse, spitting blood, by the mad wails of the ghost kings.

[Screech!] [Screech!] [Screech!]
“What the….”

Huh Nam-gwon, a descendant of a ghost clan with a natural affinity for ghost spirits, looked up at the sky, spitting a mouthful of blood.

Usually, the ghost spirits that approached him with friendliness were now all frantically wailing.

[A great ghost has arrived!!!!] [A great ghost has entered the grand graveyard!!!] [Run! Run or we’ll be devoured!!!]
The woman in white wept and ran, avoiding the ghost kings, while the corpse-like man screamed and ran, his face turning red with blood.

The bald tattooed man clutched his heart, collapsing and coughing up blood.

Meanwhile, outside the shrine, Heo Gwak stroked his chin.

Clatter, clatter, clatter….

“Hmm, the memorial tablets are shaking….”

The memorial tablets connected to the grand graveyard in the shrine.

For mid-realm disciples, entering the grand graveyard with a living body was impossible.

Heo Gwak assumed that the ‘elders’ inside were merely playing pranks on the new disciples, laughing heartily.

“The ancestors seem quite excited, indicating that these new disciples must be very talented. Eupyeon! I’m leaving now, guide the Yin Soul disciples to the technique library once they finish their selection in the grand graveyard.”

[Yes, Elder.]
Heo Gwak laughed again at the clattering memorial tablets and left the shrine.
