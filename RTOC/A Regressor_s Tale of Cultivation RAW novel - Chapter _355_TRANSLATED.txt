### Demonic Sect (7)

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Under the dark sky of the Netherworld.

At the northern end of the Anjie region, adjacent to the Nanjie region.

In that vicinity, an enormous cloud of dust rose.

"Great Protector, another Marquis-level Ghost King has arrived."

"Yes, I see it."

Jeon Myeonghun stood at the edge of the Guangyin Territory, arms crossed, receiving reports from the ghostly creatures while gazing at the distant dust cloud.

"They're exuding an immense killing intent."

He spoke calmly, sitting down and stroking the hand of Geum Sohae. Her hand, preserved by Jeon Myeonghun's special embalming technique, remained unchanged, dry and lifeless.

As Jeon Myeonghun looked on nonchalantly, Oh Hyunseok and Kim Yeon approached from behind.

"By the way, Myeonghun, is this okay? Including the Marquis-level Ghost King that just arrived... there are already 30 Fusion Stage Ghost Generals."

It was as he said. They had settled in the territory where the True Man's followers once resided for six months. During the period when Seo Eunhyun entered seclusion, the entire Netherworld's forces had been gathering Fusion Stage Marquises here.

It was as if the entire Netherworld was amassing troops for a war against the Wujigyo Sect.

"There's no need to worry from now on. It seems the four major forces of the Netherworld are preparing for an all-out war. In a few months, there might be hundreds of Fusion Stage beings gathered here."

Seeing him laugh heartily, Oh Hyunseok's expression grew even more worried.

"Hmm, how about calling that Yeonwi person back now? Are you sure this is okay?"

"Well... our ancestor is knowledgeable in many ways, but sometimes he can be quite careless. Sometimes it's better to trust Seo Eunhyun than our ancestor."

"What if he makes a wrong judgment?"

"Even if it seems like a mistake, it's better to trust him."

He clenched Geum Sohae's hand tightly and muttered.

"If only I had trusted my comrade's words back then... maybe Sohae wouldn't have died...!"

Seeing this, Oh Hyunseok looked a bit sympathetic.

"...Alright. I'll trust him too."

At that moment.

Flash! Boom!

From the camp of the four major forces' allied army, a spear of light shot towards the Guangyin Territory. The spear, imbued with the energy of Pasa Hyeonjeong, burned through the ghostly aura of the Netherworld as it flew towards them.

Oh Hyunseok took a step forward, seeing this.

"Ha, they're starting to pick a fight."

As purple energy began to surge from his entire body, Kim Yeon stepped past him and moved forward.

Buzz!

With her light pink bow fluttering, she took her stance.

Jeon Myeonghun, seeing Kim Yeon, seemed startled and asked cautiously.

"Hey, Kim Yeon. Are you okay?"

But Kim Yeon didn't answer. Instead, she bit her lips and muttered with an unstable gaze.

"No... I can't forgive them. Seo Eunhyun is mine. I can't forgive those who try to harm Seo Eunhyun...!"

Swish!

She stomped her foot and seemed to fly into the sky, raising her left hand towards the spear of light.

Boom!

The spear, imbued with the light of Pasa Hyeonjeong, was deflected into the sky, spinning.

Kim Yeon, changing her stance in mid-air, pulled back her right hand, imbued with overwhelming strength.

As the spear fell to her eye level, she swung her right hand towards the handle.

Boom!

A light pink ripple spread through the air, and the spear was sent back towards where it came from.

Boom!

The light of Pasa Hyeonjeong exploded in the direction of the Netherworld's allied army's camp, spreading chaos.

Thud!

After displaying a series of martial feats, Kim Yeon landed back on the ground, biting her lips and glaring at the camp. However, no additional attacks came.

Jeon Myeonghun looked at Kim Yeon with anxious eyes.

'The intervals of her madness have shortened.'

There had been times when Kim Yeon's madness flared up before. But as long as Seo Eunhyun was by her side, it seemed to be okay, so it wasn't a big problem.

However, now that Seo Eunhyun was in seclusion, Kim Yeon's condition had rapidly deteriorated.

Jeon Myeonghun observed Kim Yeon. Having almost gone mad himself after losing Geum Sohae, he could understand. Kim Yeon was in a very dangerous state.

But he couldn't understand why.

'Why is her madness acting up? There were no problems on Earth...'

Unlike him, who had lost a lover, or Kang Minhee, who had accepted countless ghosts, or Seo Eunhyun and Oh Hyunseok, who underwent extreme training, Kim Yeon had no such experiences.

Though she had a hard time when she was captured by the Ghost Army, Seo Eunhyun had comforted her remotely, so it wasn't that difficult.

'It's strange.'

To him, Kim Yeon's madness seemed very foreign. As if someone had implanted it.

But Jeon Myeonghun didn't delve into it.

'If there was a problem, Seo Eunhyun would have taken care of it.'

The fact that Seo Eunhyun went into seclusion leaving Kim Yeon alone meant he believed she could overcome it herself.

'As much as Seo Eunhyun trusts Kim Yeon, I should trust her too.'

Jeon Myeonghun stroked Sohae's hand and closed his eyes.

'Right, Sohae?'

He trusted his comrades. Even if they seemed unstable on the surface, 'trusting' meant leaving the outcome to them.

He trusted Seo Eunhyun, Kim Yeon, and Oh Hyunseok, the Guardian Ghost Kings, and the Wujigyo Sect.

'So my job is not to worry about Kim Yeon but to protect the sect with all my might until Seo Eunhyun's seclusion ends.'

A faint red lightning flowed from his eyes.

"...As the Great Protector of the Wujigyo Sect, I command. Do not intercept attacks like the one just now, Kim Yeon. Instead, leave it to Oh Hyunseok. Kim Yeon, you will move the puppets to block large-scale attacks."

Jeon Myeonghun gently placed Geum Sohae's hand back into the box and then into his bosom before standing up.

"Spreading chaos and poison in the enemy's camp is Hongbeom's job. Intercepting attacks from afar is Oh Hyunseok's. Large-scale offensives are Kim Yeon's. And I will deal with the Marquis-level Ghost Kings who directly invade here. Remember your roles well!"

At his words, Kim Yeon looked at Jeon Myeonghun for a moment, then nodded as if accepting it even in her madness.

And a few days passed.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Marquis-level Ghost Kings from all over the Netherworld began to gather more and more in the opposing camp. And as their numbers increased, attacks towards the Guangyin Territory became more frequent.

Boom!

Oh Hyunseok, transformed into the Giant God of Stars, swung a green talisman through the Celestial Winged Chain, clicking his tongue.

"My hands are numb. Is this the strike of a Fusion Stage Ghost General..."

His face was filled with deep concern.

"Can we really handle this? There are now over 50 Fusion Stage Ghost Generals..."

"It's fine. If I use 'that,' I can hold them off for a moment."

"Y-yes... you have 'that.'"

But even Jeon Myeonghun, who spoke, didn't look pleased.

'Hurry up and finish your seclusion, Seo Eunhyun.'

In a short-term battle, Jeon Myeonghun could use a special method to exert power equivalent to 50 Fusion Stage Marquises. But it was a method that posed significant risks to Jeon Myeonghun himself. Moreover, if the number of Marquises continued to increase, Jeon Myeonghun would have no way to handle it.

'I trust and will protect, Seo Eunhyun! So please... hurry...!'

All he could do was trust and wait for Seo Eunhyun.

Jeon Myeonghun contemplated his cultivation, which had reached the level of the Four Pillars, and stared at the opposing camp with tense eyes.

* * *

Boom! Boom! Boom!

In a dark secret room.

Inside, a boy who had reached the 14-star level of the Spirit Cloud of the Spirit Stage was rotating the Spirit Cloud around him.

And at some point!

The boy half-opened his eyes and inhaled the swirling Spirit Cloud around him.

Simultaneously.

Boom!

A sound like thunder echoed inside his dantian, and a Spirit Cloud formed within him.

Buzz!

A faint but pure energy swirled inside the boy's body.

The boy, Ham Jin, brightened up.

"F-finally...!"

He couldn't hide his joy as he saw the pure energy emanating from his body.

"I've... reached the Foundation Establishment Stage!"

Reading the celestial signs, he saw that his lifespan had increased by 300 years, and he was overjoyed.

'Finally! I've reached the true rank of a demigod!'

At that moment.

A man in white clothes in front of him chuckled and clicked his tongue.

"You've just barely reached the Foundation Establishment Stage. Manage your Acupoints well and stabilize your realm. You still have a long way to go to surpass your master, who is at the Decision Stage."

"Yes...! I still have a long way to go to become a Sage from a demigod."

"...Yes... The Decision Stage is not an easy realm. Anyway. Now the 'work' will speed up."

"Yes, I can feel the 'Gyutojangseong Formula' becoming more active."

About a year ago.

Ham Jin had used the knowledge imparted by the Great Being, the 'Gyutojangseong Formula.'

Buzz-

Inside the dark secret room, the light of the dragon veins gathered.

Originally a technique for the Foundation Establishment Stage, the man in white had modified it so that it could be learned from the Spirit Stage.

As Ham Jin used this technique, he felt as if he could grasp the dragon veins within the valley.

'When I was at the Spirit Stage, I could barely sense the location of one dragon vein, but now I can vaguely sense the locations of dozens, hundreds of dragon veins!'

He smiled.

Over the past year, avoiding the eyes of his master, Yeomgok, he had twisted the directions of the dragon veins throughout Jeolgwigok.

Before he knew it, the dragon veins throughout Jeolgwigok had become entangled, forming the shape of the formation that the Great Being had initially requested.

Now that Ham Jin had reached the Foundation Establishment Stage, completing the formation would be easier.

"Anyway, once I make a few more adjustments to the formation and the Great Being activates it..."

"Yes, you will be free from your master."

"Finally... Thank you for everything. I want to thank you in advance. I reached the Foundation Establishment Stage thanks to you, Tugwi-nim."

"Haha, it's thanks to your hard work."

Ham Jin sincerely thanked the being bestowed upon him by the Wujigyo King, the 'Infinite Tugwi.'

He recalled a year ago.

He remembered the words of the Great Being, the Wujigyo King.

After meeting the Wujigyo King in his conscious world, Ham Jin had opened his eyes to see a 'new being.'

A mysterious man in white clothes.

He had introduced himself as 'Infinite Tugwi' and said that the Wujigyo King had sent him to assist Ham Jin.

The term 'Tugwi (Ghost)' was not a lie. He was visible only to Ham Jin, and no one in Jeolgwigok, including his master, noticed Tugwi.

Over the past year, Infinite Tugwi had meticulously taught Ham Jin techniques, sometimes guiding the flow of energy to help him cultivate his realm.

Thanks to this, Ham Jin had reached the Foundation Establishment Stage in an unbelievable amount of time.

"But, Tugwi-nim. Why didn't the Wujigyo King teach me the techniques himself and instead sent you?"

Ham Jin asked as he opened the door to the dark secret room.

Tugwi smiled and replied.

"I told you before. The King is extending his consciousness to countless worlds and fulfilling the wishes of many, so he doesn't have the leisure."

"I see... If the King had taught me himself... it might have been a bit scary."

"Haha, you might have been so scared that you would have fainted."

Tugwi teased with a kind face, and Ham Jin smiled.

But soon, he wiped the smile off his face.

Not long after leaving the secret room, his master, Yeomgok, ran up to him excitedly and began examining his body.

"Really! Unbelievable! It's true! Haha, to reach that realm in such a short time. As expected of my favorite disciple! Ah, this vibrant body overflowing with pure energy!"

Yeomgok, excited, examined Ham Jin's body as if he were about to drool.

Ham Jin glanced at Infinite Tugwi beside him.

Yeomgok didn't notice Tugwi at all, and Tugwi nodded and spoke to Ham Jin.

"It's another test. Stay calm."

Ham Jin nodded.

Since Infinite Tugwi had been by his side, he had informed Ham Jin of his master's intentions whenever Yeomgok tried to do something to him.

"He seems pleased, but he is very wary of you. He is highly suspicious of you reaching the Foundation Establishment Stage without a Foundation Pill in such a short time."

Ham Jin swallowed hard.

At that moment, Yeomgok laughed heartily and patted Ham Jin on the shoulder.

"With a disciple growing so robustly, I have no regrets! Since it has come to this, I will pass everything on to you in three days!"

"...!"

Ham Jin's eyes shook at his words.

'Th-that means...'

It meant that his body was now ripe enough to be taken over.

Ham Jin was filled with fear, but under the watchful eyes of Tugwi, he managed to show no reaction.

"It's an honor to inherit everything from you, Master!"

"...Yes. I'm glad you like it."

Yeomgok looked at Ham Jin with a meaningful gaze and smiled.

"In three days, I will invite all the Sages of Yuhwaguk and pass on my treasured artifact, the Black Ridge Seal, to you. I will announce you as my successor in front of them, so make sure you don't make any mistakes on that day."

After patting Ham Jin on the shoulder, Yeomgok turned and left Ham Jin's quarters.

"...Tugwi-nim, wh-what should I do? He plans to take my body in three days...!? No, more importantly..."

Ham Jin asked, unable to understand.

"I thought the three Sages of Yuhwaguk didn't get along. Why would he invite them to announce me as his successor...? What does it mean?"

Tugwi chuckled at his words and replied.

"It seems, for some reason, those three Decision Stage beings are cooperating."

"Yes!?"

Ham Jin's face turned pale.

He had hoped to escape his master's grasp by exploiting the fact that the three Sages didn't get along, but this news was terrifying.

But Tugwi smiled dismissively.

"Don't worry. It seems what those three Decision Stage beings want aligns with what the Wujigyo King wants. Judging by the mention of the artifact... they probably plan to use it to open a path to the underground. If that happens, you might not need to adjust the formation any further."

"Yes...?"

"Don't worry. With my abilities, I've already figured out your master's plans, even the parts you don't know. He plans to use a technique to explosively open a path to the underground and then quickly switch to your body."

"...!"

Hearing this from Infinite Tugwi, Ham Jin bit his lip.

"...Tugwi-nim, can I survive?"

He didn't doubt the Wujigyo King who sent him, but Infinite Tugwi seemed to have only the strength of a low-level cultivator.

And though the Wujigyo King was great, he resided in a distant otherworld, while his master was right in front of him.

"My master, the Black Ridge Old Monster Yeomgok, is a Sage! An earthly god who won't die until the Golden Elixir is broken!"

"..."

'I didn't expect the grand event to come so soon...'

Ham Jin, gripped by anxiety, gritted his teeth.

"Tugwi-nim, please tell me, can I really overcome that Sage...?"

Infinite Tugwi seemed to want to persuade him for a moment, then sighed.

"...Don't worry. Trust and believe. I will show you a new future. You will one day reach a realm far beyond that Decision Stage."

"B-but..."

Buzz-

"...!"

But before Ham Jin could ask more, Infinite Tugwi had already turned into a gust of wind and disappeared before his eyes.

His voice echoed in Ham Jin's trembling ears.

-Don't worry. I have already reached the realm, and I have enough power to save you...

Words whose meaning he couldn't understand.

But somehow, Ham Jin felt confidence in that voice and bit his lip, trusting and waiting.

* * *

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Netherworld.

Guangyin Territory.

At the forefront, the Protectors and Guardian Ghost Kings of the Wujigyo Sect stood, watching the other side.

The ground was shaking.

The stars were emitting ominous light, and a visible ominous glow was emanating from the enemy camp.

Oh Hyunseok swallowed hard, and Kim Yeon revealed her ominous madness.

And at the center, Jeon Myeonghun stood, his eyes shining.

"96 Fusion Stage beings... and 7 followers corrupted by the True Man..."

In the distance, seven Ghost Kings, resembling Seo Eunhyun with multiple heads, floated in the air.

Jeon Myeonghun instinctively felt it.

"Everyone, stay alert. They are... all gathered now."

Although the entire Netherworld had designated them as public enemies, not all their forces could come. They needed personnel to guard and manage their territories, so they must have set a limit on how many they could send.

Seeing no more Fusion Stage Ghost Kings being added, it seemed this was the end.

But even so, there were 108 Fusion Stage Marquises.

'Even Seo Eunhyun could only perish together with about ten Marquises. Can I... protect the Guangyin Territory from them...?'

But Jeon Myeonghun shook his head.

There was no need for questions.

He had to protect it.

At that moment, Kim Yeon's eyes shone.

"They're coming."

Jeon Myeonghun's eyes shone at her words.

It was as she said.

Those who had been attacking from afar with spells were now moving towards them.

Everyone's faces, including Jeon Myeonghun's, were filled with tension.

But Jeon Myeonghun, though tense, gritted his teeth and moved forward.

'Protect me, Sohae.'

Th
