I swallowed nervously as I watched Jang Ik draw his sword. 

“…Great Han Cheon Joonja, I have heard of your illustrious name.”

“Do you have something to say?”

“First of all, I am not just a simple Simjok, but a descendant of the Cheonjok. The way I descended to this realm was by temporarily possessing the body of this boy from the Buhae realm. In other words, if you and I fight, this boy will surely die. Even if I perish, please show mercy to this child.”

Han Cheon Joonja looked at me with curious eyes.

“You claim to be a Cheonjok…? Interesting. The Cheonjok I know consider the lives of their vessels as mere fertilizer…”

“…”

“Well, fine. Then come out of that boy’s body. Even as a Cheonjok, you should be able to ‘greet’ me properly once you reach the level of Eojeon Ilbo.”

“Thank you for your consideration, but if I leave, this boy will burn to death in the heat of this planet.”

“Do you think I would ask you to come out without considering that?”

Jang Ik swung his sword towards the high-temperature area around us. 

Kugugugu!

Then, something astonishing happened. It seemed as if gravity itself twisted for a moment. No, it felt as if the very laws of nature were being bent. Under the scorching star, the hellish surface of the planet began to change according to Jang Ik’s will. It was as if nature itself obeyed his command, similar to how cultivators use spells to twist the laws. In an instant, the fiery hell transformed into a clear and pristine valley where humans could survive. Although no grass or trees grew, clear water sprang forth, cooling and moistening the land. A clear lake, where greenery seemed ready to sprout at any moment, unfolded before my eyes.

“Throw him inside and come out.”

“…”

I was dumbfounded and gaped in astonishment.

‘With the power of a Simjok… is that even possible?’

Until now, I had thought that martial arts focused solely on competing and defeating opponents compared to spells. Of course, there were martial arts that could create flames and guide water, but transforming nature itself like Jang Ik did was more in the realm of cultivators’ spells. After placing Ham Jin’s body in the lake Jang Ik created, I used the technique of Jwatalipmang to exit Ham Jin’s upper dantian.

Splash, splash!

The technique of Jwatalipmang was essentially a clone, and this clone was not much different from the main body in terms of pure Simjok skills. Although it lacked the stamina of the main body, that was the only difference. Jang Ik looked slightly displeased as he watched me crawl out of Ham Jin’s upper dantian.

“…Well… it’s all good, but why do you come out of the head like some sinister parasitic monster looking for another host? You could just come out normally.”

“…I have trained in Gui Do Gong for a while, and it seems to have become a habit. Please understand.”

After glancing at the unconscious Ham Jin, who had fainted from using all his energy and mana, I looked around at the completely transformed environment and spoke.

“What did you do here?”

“What’s the point of learning to fly if you can’t even walk? If you are a Cheonjok capable of descending into a lower realm, you should be able to do something similar with spells, so don’t worry about it.”

I had no words to refute his logic, so I left the area Jang Ik had created and took a stance.

“I was just thinking about the next step, so I asked.”

“Well, that’s not a bad attitude. However, what I did was not so much an enlightenment of Eojeon Ilbo, but rather a technique I developed to stabilize the Nanke region and establish a Simjok territory after reaching Eojeon Ilbo.”

“I see… Then I will ask about the next realm… while paying my respects.”

Before I even finished speaking, I focused my mind and shot towards Jang Ik like lightning. Gathering the energy of heaven and earth, I formed a Qi Sword and aimed directly at Jang Ik’s face. However, he deflected my sword with just one of his swords, without even drawing the other.

“Come closer.”

A somewhat unexpected remark. But I understood what he meant. Between Jang Ik and me, countless ‘domains’ and ‘scenes’ were overflowing. Mostly scenes of me being beaten by Jang Ik, my body being split, or my head exploding. And the domains were places Jang Ik could obliterate with a single move. These places and scenes, thousands and tens of thousands of them, violently pressed down on my mind. Despite the physical proximity, the countless domains and scenes made Jang Ik feel incredibly distant. He was telling me to come closer.

‘Remove his domain.’

Boom!

I stepped forward with my right foot, leaning my left side back, and slashed from the upper left to the lower right towards Jang Ik. Before the stone fragments I kicked up could fall back down, Jang Ik moved his sword, spinning three times in place, and launched three slashes to the right. It felt like a giant claw was coming down on me. I immediately changed my stance, slightly misaligning my sword to deflect the claw. I had to deflect it. If not…

The next moment.

‘Huh?’

I found myself flung into space. As I regained my senses, I saw the aftermath of the clash between Jang Ik and me, rippling from the star I had been on.

‘From just that one strike, I was sent this far…’

Before I could finish my thought, I noticed Jang Ik above me, holding his sword with both hands, ready to slice me apart.

‘I have to dodge!’

I frantically transformed my body into a Total Sword to escape his strike. Although there was no air in space, the fact that everything in the area where Jang Ik crossed his two swords had been annihilated sent chills down my spine. And then, Jang Ik’s intent echoed through the cosmos like a resonating bell.

—Do not dodge.

Shiver!

Boom!

Even though I had dodged, my waist was severed, and my upper and lower halves were cut apart.

—You will die.

‘Why, why!?’

The fact that the clone of Jwatalipmang was split in half was not the issue. Jang Ik’s strike had clearly been executed on a level I could not comprehend.

* * *

“Master!!!”

Suddenly, an emergency alarm rang throughout the entire Muguk Cult. It was an alarm that sounded when the leader of the Muguk Cult, Muguk Guiwang Seo Eunhyun, was critically injured. Hong Beom, who was sitting on the cult’s throne, quickly sealed Seo Eunhyun’s waist, which had been severed.

“W-What is this… Why all of a sudden…?”

An incomprehensible event. However, despite this bizarre occurrence, Seo Eunhyun did not wake up. Instead, he sat on the throne with a more focused expression, concentrating on something.

* * *

‘I don’t know how he did it, but he cut even my main body!’

A terrifying skill! It meant that in front of Jang Ik, tricks like clones or main bodies were meaningless. Gritting my teeth, I manifested three thousand Qi Swords around me. I had created the Colorless Glass Sword.

Swoosh!

Three thousand Qi Swords danced and attacked Jang Ik. The formless dance, boasting infinite trajectories, became a massive slash that could split mountains—

Boom!

As Jang Ik swung his sword, the combined attack of the sword formation shattered, and my right arm was severed.

Rumble!

There is no sound in space, but there is vibration. Looking behind me, I saw that the planet Jang Ik had attacked, not the one where Ham Jin was, was split in half.

—Do it properly.

Srrrng—

His gaze alone seemed to crush my soul. Jang Ik had already reached me, holding his sword in both hands.

—Even though you are a Simjok, since you are a Cheonjok, I have no qualms about killing you.

Whirr!

My Qi Sword ascended to the level of the soul and then descended. The strike of the Mountain Heart Sword exploded towards Jang Ik, but he shattered it head-on with his sword.

Boom!

My Jwatalipmang clone could not withstand Jang Ik’s strike and was flung towards the star. Jang Ik pursued me again. No, saying he pursued is incorrect. If I blinked, he was already in front of me. He was different from Kim Younghoon or other combined technique investigators. If Kim Younghoon was too fast to perceive or if the combined technique investigators jumped through space, he used a different method.

Whoosh!

To avoid burning in the star’s heat, I focused all my energy on the Total Sword to deflect Jang Ik’s next strike. He lifted his foot and stomped down. Although it was a small green foot, I saw a terrifying vision of a continent being shattered by his kick.

Crack!

The Jwatalipmang clone was slammed into the star’s surface. I saw red flames and a storm of heat rising from the star’s surface. A storm large enough to engulf a small planet!

‘This is the level of a Star Shattering Technique…’

I was almost paralyzed by this cosmic power, but I gritted my teeth and focused on the Total Sword. There was no time for other thoughts!

‘I figured out how Jang Ik moves!’

Amazingly, Jang Ik was moving through dimensions! Of course, he wasn’t moving through all dimensions but was temporarily moving through the dimension of the soul and then descending to a lower dimension. After realizing Jang Ik’s method, I sensed the dimension of the soul and extended the Total Sword.

Danak!

Crack!

The secret technique of the Danak Sword, executed with all my might, slightly grazed Jang Ik’s cheek as he appeared before me in the blink of an eye. His skin split, and a small drop of blood splattered. Despite being on the star’s surface, the blood drop looked like it was from an ordinary star or the Buhae realm, indicating that Jang Ik’s surroundings were essentially another dimension.

Jang Ik wiped the blood with a surprised expression and exclaimed in admiration.

—You’re a clever one. You figured out I was moving through dimensions and immediately counterattacked.

Boom!

As he spoke, Jang Ik swung his sword again, and I used all the remaining power in the Jwatalipmang clone to deflect it. However, the aftermath alone left the clone’s body in tatters, and to make matters worse, the main body sitting on the Muguk Cult’s throne was also vomiting blood and dying.

‘I can’t die fighting Jang Ik in this life!’

I began to draw power from the main body through the dimension of the soul using the Total Sword.

Rumble!

The ley lines of the Gwangum region gathered around the main body, consuming their power to open a path between me and the main body. Although the main body couldn’t cross over, I could use its other powers for a short-term battle. I converted the main body’s Cheonjok and Jjok cultivation into energy, transferred it through the Total Sword to the dimension of the soul, and then descended it back to the dimension of the mind. Of course, this method wasn’t free, and I felt the ley lines of the Gwangum region temporarily drying up as a price.

Whirr!

A Samtaegeuk appeared behind me. Jang Ik exclaimed in admiration once again.

—Ha, I intended to blow you up with just your head left with that last strike…. That sword, it moves through dimensions? You’re making good use of your self-manifestation.

He laughed heartily and praised me. Then, another green slash came flying. I deflected Jang Ik’s power and was flung away again.

Boom!

I was swept beyond the star’s horizon and flung out of the star’s vicinity. There was no time to distinguish between gravity, spells, circuits, curses, or the power of the first. If I didn’t want to die, I had to use everything!

Crunch!

Jang Ik’s hand grabbed my head.

—Impressive. I don’t know how you did it, but you’re on par with a combined technique investigator. If other Joonja saw you, they’d want to take you as a disciple.

His hand was small, but I felt as if every cell in my body was gripped by his hand.

‘I have to counterattack.’

Jang Ik raised his sword again. Although he let go of my head, I couldn’t move. But…

If I get hit by that, I’ll die!

Crack!

I forced my body to move within the fear he had instilled. Then, I combined all the techniques of the Danak Sword. At the same time, I poured all the power of the Samtaegeuk into one strike. I bet everything on this one move!

—Ha, it’s a cute struggle, but….

I could feel it. No, I could see it. In the next moment, my entire body would be shattered, and I would become a bloody mess. So, I changed that future!

—Become delicious, little Cheonjok!

Flash!

In a fleeting moment, my body disappeared from all perceptions and flows. In that instant, I became one with the void, avoiding Jang Ik’s perception.

Crack!

I saw Jang Ik’s eyes narrow. His sword couldn’t find me. However, Jang Ik quickly switched his strike to a wide-area attack. His sword turned the area around the star green.

Swoosh!

Tiny needle-like strikes spread throughout the area around the star. And in that brief moment, I barely avoided his gaze, but with all my energy exhausted, I was left with holes all over my body, being pulled into the star’s gravity.

‘Damn it…’

I couldn’t move. The tiny needles Jang Ik scattered had pierced me all over, holding me in place. I had lost. And Jang Ik appeared before me. He was holding Ham Jin in one hand. Jang Ik was distorting the laws around him, allowing Ham Jin to breathe even in the star’s environment. But I couldn’t understand. Was he planning to kill Ham Jin because he was also a Cheonjok? However, Jang Ik suddenly grabbed me by the scruff of my neck, laughed heartily, and started flying somewhere. And then, it happened.

Rumble!

Suddenly, from the ‘middle ground’ where Ham Jin and I had been transmitted, a black ‘hand’ emerged from the planet covered in intense heat.

‘What!’

Buzz!

My whole body trembled. It was hard to maintain my consciousness. That, that is….

Rumble!

Jang Ik began to leap through infinite space-time with us. And the giant hand, like a dry tree branch, emerging from the star, was chasing us through infinite space-time. He laughed heartily and spoke. I couldn’t respond to Jang Ik’s words, only screaming in the void of space as the giant hand chased us. Thus, Jang Ik and I flew somewhere beyond infinite space-time.
