Countless thoughts and confusion swirled in my mind. "Why? Didn't she say she was going after Seo Hyul? Is she unable to objectively assess herself? Or does she automatically track me regardless? Cutting off a leg? If she's chasing me, cutting off a leg won't help. Should I fight? How did she manage to follow me all the way here...?"

Before I knew it, we had arrived at the place where Jeon Myunghun's return lightning strike had begun, in front of the city of the different race that housed the teleportation array leading to the Human Alliance.

"Huff... Huff..."

Only then did I manage to grasp her true form. "I see..."

Only her left arm! Her left arm had separated from her and was holding onto my leg, following me. I sighed in relief and grabbed her left arm that was clutching my leg.

"What, what is that?"

"That, that is... her left arm?"

Jeon Myunghun looked puzzled, and Kim Yeon turned pale. I wiped the cold sweat from my forehead and shook my head.

"It's a part of the strongest puppet that the Monster Lord possesses. There's no need to worry. It's not for attacking, and it's not even for tracking."

As I operated the Mysterious Heart Technique and connected to her arm, I found the will of the Monster Lord, whose madness had subsided, inside.

"I see. It's a teaching aid for his disciple."

Though he could no longer teach from afar, the Monster Lord, whose madness had subsided, wanted to impart whatever he could to his disciple. Ultimately, it even hinted at how to activate the 'Connection of Fate.'

I read the consciousness of the Monster Lord contained in her left arm. Gradually, I became entranced by his message.

"Disciple, listen."

Suddenly, I saw an illusion of an old man sitting in front of me.

"I know you must resent me. You must hate me to the core. You might not even consider me your master. I can only say I'm sorry. But... despite that, there is something I must achieve with your help."

The emotion of 'regret' was palpable in the Monster Lord's message.

"I won't ask for the luxury of forgiveness. Instead... use me. Just as I used you, use the knowledge I have sent you to grow and become stronger. From what I've seen, you have things you desire and people you love."

He looked at me with a regretful expression and smiled. In the extreme state of my Mysterious Heart Technique, I somehow saw a scene behind him. It was an old tree. No, it was a bare tree with all its leaves and flowers fallen on a cold winter day. And countless pale pink ribbons were hanging from that tree.

"Ah..."

What on earth is that scene? I didn't know in detail. But for some reason, I felt it was related to the next stage of the Mysterious Heart Technique.

"In this strange and beautiful world, I hope you find what you desire...."

I couldn't take my eyes off that strange and beautiful scene for a moment. And then, suddenly,

"Ah!"

I was startled and shivered. It was a strange feeling. This was the message the Monster Lord had left in her left arm. And as I read that message, I had a sudden realization. The Monster Lord's enlightenment contained in his left arm awakened my mind.

"I see... my mind is indeed troubled right now."

Only then did I realize that the worry I felt from Seorip was not an overreaction. If it weren't for the Monster Lord's enlightenment, I might never have realized it, even if I died and came back to life.

"Thank you, Elder Jo Yeon."

After thanking the Monster Lord in my heart, I looked at Kim Yeon.

"Yeon, try holding this left arm while operating the Mysterious Heart Technique."

"What?"

She obediently followed my words. As her Mysterious Heart Technique connected with her left arm, she too seemed to receive the Monster Lord's message. She bit her lip, remaining silent for a while. Her emotions seemed complicated. The Monster Lord had modified and used her in a way close to torture. If I had been a little later in rescuing her, her mind might have been damaged. But separate from the 'Monster Lord,' the message left by the human 'Jo Yeon,' and the strange enlightenment contained in that message, was enough to shake a person's heart.

Kim Yeon bit her lip for a while and then turned her head.

"Are we staying here?"

"No. We're going to take the teleportation array to the Human Alliance's territory."

"Then please take us there. I want to move for now."

"Alright."

Jeon Myunghun, Kim Yeon, and I left the place and returned to the Human Alliance.

* * *

"Thank goodness..."

I sighed in relief and looked at the sweat on my hands. When the main body was captured, I couldn't do anything and just watched the main body with sweaty hands. But fortunately, I managed to escape from the Monster Lord safely, and through the Monster Lord's Mysterious Heart Technique, I realized the mental anomaly. However, for some reason, I still felt a sense of unease in a corner of my heart.

"Is it simply a mental anomaly?"

And what the main body did was 'discover' the mental anomaly, not 'cure' it. I had to find a way to resolve it somehow.

"I'll have to keep an eye on it."

With that resolution, I arrived at the Black Ghost Bone Valley and went to find the Ghost Soul Pavilion. The main pavilions of the Black Ghost Bone Valley were all inside the Submerged Abyss, so I had to go there. I entered the Submerged Abyss and found the Ghost Soul Pavilion inside.

"Bi Yul, you haven't forgotten my request, have you?"

Of course, with my rank and position, I couldn't meet Kang Minhee directly. But if it was Bi Yul, the Ghost King and an elder of the Celestial Human Sect, there was a high possibility that my request for a meeting would be accepted immediately.

Knock, knockâ€”

I knocked on the door of the deputy pavilion master's office in the Ghost Soul Pavilion. After a while, a black ghost poked its head out from above the office door. Then Bi Yul emerged from my body and spoke. The gatekeeper ghost immediately bowed its head upon seeing the Ghost King Bi Yul and retracted its head back inside.

Creak!

Hiding my nervous emotions, I stepped inside. The deputy pavilion master's office was cold. It wasn't just the coldness of the five elements; it was a chill that originated from death itself, piercing my bones and stimulating my soul. Kang Minhee's office was quite dark, with blue ghostly flames floating around. Kang Minhee was drawing some kind of design on the floor with dye, paying no attention to me.

Looking at her, I thought she hadn't changed at all.

"If there was work and a person, work always came first."

Her face looked as tired as it did before coming to the Celestial Fragrance, as if she had been working overtime for days. I pondered how to start the conversation and then opened my mouth.

"Great Elder Kang, the elder I serve wishes to have a meeting with you."

At those words, Bi Yul emerged from my body and cleared his throat. Only then did Kang Minhee stop drawing the design and look at us.

The atmosphere in the room grew even colder as she looked at us.

"What brings you here, Senior Ghost King?"

Kang Minhee's voice was small and weak. An ordinary person would have just perceived it as a soft-spoken voice. However, as soon as Bi Yul heard her voice, his ghostly body began to tremble as if it would collapse.

"What is this..."

I looked around with my spiritual sense and was astonished. As soon as she spoke, the entire pavilion shook, and cracks appeared and disappeared in the outskirts of the underworld as if they had gained life. Although she didn't directly harbor death in her soul like I did, I could feel that she was overwhelmingly superior to me in 'wielding' death.

"That's because Senior Ghost King is here."

"Indeed."

With that, Kang Minhee looked at me with a blank expression and spoke.

"How many merit points do you have?"

I awkwardly replied.

"I don't have any yet. I'm currently on a mission, and I'll receive 400 points once it's completed."

"Is that so? Come back when you have a thousand points. Or if you ascend to the Celestial Human Sect, I'll consider giving you a position as a pavilion master."

At those words, Bi Yul cleared his throat again.

"Senior."

Kang Minhee looked at Bi Yul with a blank expression. A faint ghostly fire was burning in her eyes.

"If you continue to speak like this, I will report it to the Disciplinary Pavilion and enforce the rules. Please do not cause trouble with matters not permitted by the sect's regulations."

At her gaze, Bi Yul's spirit began to tremble as if it would collapse. I couldn't help but smile inwardly at the sight.

"That personality... still remains."

Honestly, I was a bit surprised. A year and a half before coming to the Celestial Fragrance, due to an incident, she had become extremely obsessed with 'rules.' Should I call it FM? Originally, I was the one who adhered to FM more, while she tended to ignore it.

"If you have nothing more to say, please leave. You're disturbing me."

She gestured towards us. A chilling ghostly wind blew, pushing us out. But I absorbed Bi Yul back into my body and took a step forward instead.

"Greetings, Elder Kang. I am Seorip, a recent disciple of the Black Ghost Bone Valley."

"What is it?"

She looked at me with an annoyed expression.

"I can't tell if you're human or ghost. You're so dark that I can't even see your original face. It's an excellent ghostly talent, but I have no intention of giving you special treatment. Leave."

"Ah, while the Ghost King I serve wished for that, I have come to ask you something else, Elder."

"...What is it?"

I recalled the events from a year and a half before falling to the Celestial Fragrance.

"Elder Kang, are you in charge of communicating with the main sect of the Ghost Realm?"

"Yes, I am."

A year and a half ago, she made a significant mistake in a major project and received a severe reprimand.

"I have a question... Is the elder in front of me the main body?"

"No, this is a clone. The main body is located in the 'side path,' absorbing the energy flowing from the Ghost Realm to stabilize its realm."

"Stabilizing the realm?"

"The main body has reached the Death Convergence stage. Ah...! Now that I think about it, this is confidential..."

Kang Minhee pressed her temples with her index finger as if she had a headache.

"Well, it will be known once the side path seclusion is over anyway... But just in case, don't go around talking about it."

"Understood."

"...But it's strange. Have we met before?"

"...I don't think so. Why do you ask?"

She looked at me for a moment, then got up from the design and sat down on a nearby chair.

"Well... it's strange that I'm telling you such confidential information. Actually, the side path is also confidential, so I shouldn't be talking about it... Sigh, never mind. Since my concentration is broken because of you... I might as well take a break."

Snap!

As she snapped her fingers, the blue ghostly flames brightened, illuminating the room.

"If you have any questions, ask."

Looking at her unchanged demeanor, I asked.

"I want to ask about the Ghost Realm itself."

"Are you interested in the main sect?"

"Yes."

A year and a half before falling to the Celestial Fragrance, due to her mistake, a disciplinary committee was convened. Fortunately, she didn't receive severe punishment, but she was quite shocked. And the week after the disciplinary committee, during a company dinner, we, who had broken up early in our careers, decided to get back together that day.
