A brief staredown occurred between Seohyeol and me. Seohyeol seemed to look at me for a moment before smiling faintly. 

"Hehe, as expected of a Daoist. Are you also someone from 'above'?" He smiled and pointed to the sky.

"'Above,' huh?" I shrugged as if I didn't understand, and Seohyeol laughed as if to say not to joke around.

"Hehe. I came here knowing everything, Daoist. Since you have come to the mortal world, it would be good to receive my help. As you may know, as long as the Tak Hon Man Cheon exists, this world revolves around me." He extended his hand to me with a gentle face.

"The world moves solely according to my wishes... As you know, with this divine art, it is overwhelmingly advantageous to join hands with me, no matter your purpose. Hehe, tell me, what is your purpose?"

But I scoffed. "So, you're not going to attempt brainwashing?"

"Hehe, attempting divine arts recklessly on someone like you could be disastrous."

"Hmm..." I glared at Seohyeol. I could feel it. Having experienced Seohyeol before, I knew. His 'array' was being imprinted on me. If this continued, I would be consumed by Seohyeol at some point, just like in my past life.

'If it weren't for the fact that I had once been consumed by Seohyeol and escaped, I would never have noticed.'

"...So, what you're imprinting now, can I consider it a communication terminal?" At my words, Seohyeol flinched slightly before smiling bitterly.

"As expected, you noticed right away."

"Stop joking around. If you want to collaborate properly, show some sincerity." I glared at Seohyeol coldly. He laughed as if he couldn't help it.

"Hehe, I'm sorry. As you know, I have a bit of a playful nature."

"Who are you?"

"I am... Hyeoleum."

"Hoo, Hyeoleum, huh." I glared at him. 'Does this guy not even sense the karmic fire burning in my soul?' It was truly absurd. Of course, I knew that this guy had some connection with Hyeoleum, who was presumed to be a remnant of Yoo Hodeok. He often used magic that originated from Hyeoleum. But I instead smiled slyly and asked back.

"It's the first time I've heard that the noble Hyeoleum, who originated from Yoo Hodeok, has a playful nature."

"Hehe, it seems my personality changed a bit after I got a new name."

I glared at Seohyeol, feeling the 'array' still wriggling and expanding its territory in my mind.

"I have one question, Seohyeol." If he took over my soul, he would immediately be burned by the karmic fire. If he didn't, I could manipulate him. I asked without feeling any urgency.

"What do you think about Cheonra?"

Seohyeol asked back as if he found it strange. "Hmm, who are you referring to?"

"Are you saying you don't know Cheonra while claiming to be Hyeoleum?"

Seohyeol smiled brightly at my question. "Hehe, of course, I know. But as you know, it's not something to be mentioned lightly, right?"

Seohyeol pointed to the 'above' as if there was some secret, but I found it ridiculous.

'So, you're saying 'I don't know what you're talking about, so let me off the hook'?' I smiled even more slyly.

"Then, you must not know much about the events related to the [Fishing Boats] from 40,000 years ago."

"Hehe, the Fishing Boats..."

"Yes, the Fishing Boats! The beings above the [Chief Judge of the Underworld, Yoo Hodeok], [Reincarnation Judge, Yoo Suryun], and [Deputy Judge, Haeryeong]!"

"..."

"The [Heavenly Lord of the Underworld], who dispatched the judges of the Underworld, including Jeongryongjin, to Ilwolcheon, the Heavenly Lord of the Underworld who opposes the Heavenly Lord, [Sarasoocheon], and other great beings with seats!"

"..."

I knew that mentioning these great beings would attract their attention. However, since I had already met Yang Sujin's thoughts at this point, the Heavenly Lord of the Underworld would already be watching me. And as for Sarasoocheon, I believed in Yoo Hodeok's words that he had a generous and gentle personality, and knowing that he feared the Heavenly Lord of the Underworld, I mentioned him, believing that he wouldn't do anything to me since the Heavenly Lord of the Underworld was already watching me.

I felt like my head was about to explode, but I could endure it because these were names I had become resistant to in my previous life. However, Seohyeol just laughed for a long time and remained silent.

"What's wrong, 'self-proclaimed Hyeoleum' Daoist?" I smiled slyly and approached Seohyeol, placing my hand on his shoulder. "If you are truly Hyeoleum, aren't these your longed-for superiors?"

"..."

"It would be better to hear more about the [Fishing Boats]..."

At that moment, Seohyeol suddenly reached out and grabbed my shoulder.

I flinched in surprise but smiled triumphantly at the same time. 'Have you made up your mind, Seohyeol?'

"Well, I understand. You are indeed a true Daoist." A serious light appeared in Seohyeol's eyes.

"I have always considered you a target to be wary of, but now I must upgrade you to a dangerous target."

'As expected, he has decided to brainwash me.' Do it, Seohyeol! Brainwash me completely and burn in the karmic fire!

I smiled faintly, having set a trap for Seohyeol. I could feel it. Through the array Seohyeol had imprinted on me, 'Seohyeol's' personalities began to fill me.

I protected only my mental image and hid myself deep inside. At the same time, as I couldn't move, Seohyeol reached out to my head. Jeon Myeonghun and Hongbeom, who were watching, tried to intervene, but Seohyeol didn't stop.

Seohyeol's hand reached my head. The personalities of Tak Hon Man Cheon began to fill my body. Through those personalities, Seohyeol spoke to me. Seohyeol, who grabbed my head, began to channel energy into my head. The energy entered through the Baihui point, pierced the center of my brain where the pituitary gland is located, circled my upper dantian, and then burst out through my forehead.

'This is...'

It was a familiar mental awakening technique. Originating from the Black Ghost Valley's technique, it had been passed down to the Haeryong tribe, who had fought them for many years, and then to the Makrise and Jin families influenced by them. It was related to talent awakening and was basically a technique that cleared the mind, often used in Haeryong Palace.

'Why would he use a mind-clearing technique for brainwashing... Ah, I see.'

I finally understood why Seohyeol had placed a mind-clearing technique. This wasn't to clear the mind of the 'target' being brainwashed. It was a technique to clear the mind of the 'Seohyeol's personalities' formed inside the target's mind through Tak Hon Man Cheon.

'I see...'

Tak Hon Man Cheon was a divine art that replaced the target with oneself. Depending on the situation, it could implant two, three, or even dozens of personalities. 'When brainwashing a powerful target, it seems he strengthens and clears the minds of the implanted personalities to quickly take over the target's mind.'

The reason for placing such a technique in Haeryong Palace was obvious. It was a strategy to easily implant Tak Hon Man Cheon on anyone who entered Haeryong Palace.

And I realized that Seohyeol was genuinely consuming a significant number of personalities out of the billions he had.

'This, this guy...!'

'This is a bit dangerous...!'

Even though it was only a tiny fraction of the billions, about 400 personalities were being implanted in me, all following a certain rule, sacrificing themselves to replace me with Seohyeol, and the replaced 'Seohyeol's' mind was gradually clearing.

Although I hadn't collapsed yet, even my mental image area began to shake, and I felt that if the number of implanted Seohyeol's personalities exceeded a thousand, even my mental world wouldn't be safe.

'No, no.'

But at the same time, I realized something truly terrifying while interacting with Seohyeol's Tak Hon Man Cheon. Seohyeol's Tak Hon Man Cheon was still incomplete. There was still one condition left for the 'true' Tak Hon Man Cheon to activate, and Seohyeol hadn't triggered that condition yet.

'Ha, ha, this is chilling. Damn it.'

Seohyeol, who had already imprinted an array in Jeon Myeonghun's mind, was using Jeon Myeonghun to subdue Hongbeom and slowly brainwash me. And when the proportion of 'Seohyeol' in my soul exceeded 70%, I heard a faint crackling sound.

I smiled inside my mental image. Come on, feel it.

Crackle, crackle, crackle!

Flames began to burn.

"...!"

Seohyeol flinched in surprise and trembled. My karmic fire clung to Seohyeol, who was trying to take over 'me.' Last time, he had completely severed the connection with Tak Hon Man Cheon to avoid me, but this time, he had directly connected Tak Hon Man Cheon to me to brainwash me.

My karmic fire originally only burned me. It didn't usually transfer to others. But Seohyeol was trying to take 'me' and make 'me' him. Therefore, the karmic fire began to transfer directly to Seohyeol and his Tak Hon Man Cheon.

"Kraaaah!"

Jeon Myeonghun screamed. The karmic fire that had settled in his mind began to burn. The one who had subdued Hongbeom was now being supported by Hongbeom, and I laughed as I watched Seohyeol burn in front of me.

Seohyeol, who had the karmic fire transferred to his Tak Hon Man Cheon, couldn't withstand his own terrible sins and fell away from me.

"Ugh! Hoo, hoo...!!!"

"Are you still laughing? How disgusting." I smirked, regaining my body and shining my eyes. The burning arrays of Seohyeol still remained in my mind. But Seohyeol hurriedly severed the connection between Tak Hon Man Cheon and the personalities imprinted in my mind. However, I smirked.

"Taste the wickedness of the Sim Clan."

Although it was an interesting story, the Sim Clan's Eojon Ilbo and Seohyeol's Tak Hon Man Cheon had similarities. Both could imprint 'themselves' on others. I sharpened my mental image and held a mental image clone containing Seohyeol's array in my hand.

Total Celestial Sword. One strike!

Boom!

The Total Celestial Sword pierced Seohyeol at a speed he couldn't react to, settling inside him. And I forcibly reconnected the 'burning Seohyeol's array' and Seohyeol's Tak Hon Man Cheon.

"Ugh!"

Seohyeol trembled in pain and began to retrieve the four Obokchuk in his body: Su, Bu, Gangnyeong, and Yoo Hodeok's chuk. It seemed he was trying to sever the connection between his body and Tak Hon Man Cheon to escape the karmic fire. But I laughed again.

"No, you can't."

Because I won't allow it.

I used the Bu's chuk in my body to emit gravitational force. My gravitational force captured Seohyeol's gravitational force and sealed it inside his body. Finally, the smile disappeared from Seohyeol's face. He hurriedly formed hand seals and began to flee.

Seohyeol, who had transformed into his true Haeryong form, was desperately trying to get away from me. If he got far enough, he could break the gravitational curse I had placed on him, retrieve his Obokchuk, and sever the connection with Tak Hon Man Cheon to stop the spread of the karmic fire. But I smiled coldly.

"I told you, Seohyeol."

My eyes shone with light. Flash! I became light in an instant. Seohyeol used the Shrinking Earth technique to flee, but it was useless.

"Huff... Huff, hehe...!"

"You can't escape."

I quickly caught up and grabbed Seohyeol's tail. He seemed to want to cut off his tail, but I raised the power of the Changryeong Seonggwang Ochae Dae Beop. Boom, boom, boom, boom! My body transformed into a giant of stars. I grabbed his tail and started swinging him around.

Boom, boom, boom, boom!

Seohyeol seemed to be trying to use magic to escape. Boom! I grabbed his tail and slammed him into the ground. The ground shook, causing earthquakes everywhere. Seohyeol opened his mouth and shot a beam at me. Boom! The breath of the dragon race was indeed powerful. I momentarily let go of Seohyeol's body, and he started fleeing again.

Crack, crack, crack!

Faces began to sprout from my shoulders again. Boom! I chased after him with the Three-Tai Chi as my halo. In an instant, we passed through the realms of many races beyond the Geon Gon Jung Yeok. The realm of the Yeongrin tribe. There, I finally caught Seohyeol again. Somehow, he had managed to sacrifice personalities to expel the karmic fire. The fire was no longer burning inside him.

Boom!

I swung the Total Celestial Sword again, forcibly reconnecting the karmic fire to his Tak Hon Man Cheon. Seohyeol's eyes turned bloodshot. This was a karmic fire that harmed Seohyeol's Tak Hon Man Cheon itself, more than causing him pain. He might have truly felt fear.

Flash!

He opened his mouth and shot a beam again. But I responded with beams from my 38 eyes filled with ghostly energy. Boom! The beams we shot shook the realm of the Yeongrin tribe. The Yeongrin tribe members screamed and fled in all directions.

"Haa, monsters are fighting!"

"What kind of race is that!"

"Damn it, is it a monster trying to hunt and eat the sacred dragon race!? Run, or we'll be eaten too!"

From the outside, it might have looked like a sinister giant of stars with 19 heads was hunting a blue dragon. But such trivial matters were none of my concern. I grabbed Seohyeol's neck and brought it to my face.

Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper...

I held Seohyeol's head tightly, preventing him from escaping, and whispered endless great knowledge with my 19 heads. Seohyeol struggled madly to escape from me, but he couldn't escape from me, who had inherited the true transmission of the Changhoja. At the same time, I began to dig into Seohyeol's Tak Hon Man Cheon with the Total Celestial Sword, searching for the 'true' clue to completely overturn Seohyeol's Tak Hon Man Cheon.

'Found it.'

I could feel it. The center of Tak Hon Man Cheon. There was something there. In the deepest, darkest place... I could feel what he wanted to hide. That is...

I shone my 38 eyes. 'Somewhere'! 'Somewhere' in this world! There exists the 'core' that all the personalities of Seohyeol's Tak Hon Man Cheon revolve around!

I instinctively knew. If I destroyed this 'core,' Seohyeol's Tak Hon Man Cheon would scatter into pieces. And Seohyeol's expression, which had always maintained a smile, completely changed. Expressionless. He looked at me with emotionless eyes. And then, crack! His body began to mutate. Red mist enveloped him. Seohyeol transformed from the divine form of a Haeryong into a demonic form exuding red and black energy.

Swish!

Seohyeol's body stretched out and began to wrap around me like a rope. Crack! Seohyeol, who wrapped around me, spoke in an emotionless voice. I laughed as I looked into his eyes. My eyes, burning with karmic fire, met Seohyeol's eyes, exuding demonic energy. How many lives had been ruined by Seohyeol and his plans? Jo Yeon, Gyu Ryeon, Seo Ran... He even tried to make his subordinate Won Rip a puppet. And because of that Won Rip, I... had lost so much.

Boom, boom, boom!

I could feel it. This was indeed dangerous. The Obokchuk in Seohyeol's body emitted light. I drew the power of the Three-Tai Chi, holding black and white energy in my hands. Flash! Seohyeol exploded all the Obokchuk, and I countered his self-destruction with the Taesan Yeolje Gong, even at the cost of my own realm. The Jade of Yin-Yang Five Elements protected me this time.

'Now I have a clue to destroy you, Seohyeol!'

I could feel Seohyeol's determination to eliminate me, even at the cost of self-destruction. Just as Seohyeol had shown his determination to eliminate Gwaegun in the previous cycle, he now showed his determination to eliminate me in the future. Yes, I had finally become Seohyeol's true rival.
