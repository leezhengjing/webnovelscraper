Kang Minhee did not have a father. He had an accident when she was very young. Fortunately, thanks to the substantial insurance he had taken out, Kang Minhee and her mother did not live a life of want. However, her mother was deeply immersed in shamanistic beliefs.

When Kang Minhee was seven years old, she suffered from a severe fever one day. She did not remember the events of that time, but her mother said that she had been bedridden for seven days and nights, plagued by nightmares. Even now, in the picture diary she wrote when she was seven, the nightmare was recorded. It depicted a giant in black robes sitting on a lotus flower, looking down at Kang Minhee's house from the sky.

After Kang Minhee recovered from the fever, her mother took her to a shaman, Janggun Seonnyeo, whom she frequently visited. Kang Minhee still remembered the first time she visited the shaman.

"A ghost! A big ghost has possessed her! I've never seen such a big ghost before. This child has a strong yin energy that attracts ghosts. The powerful yin energy is drawing in the ghosts. After exorcising the ghost, she must receive a divine blessing!"

At the shaman's words, who jumped in shock as if she would faint, Kang Minhee's mother tearfully agreed. Kang Minhee's opinion did not matter. Whether it was due to the influence of the ghost that supposedly possessed her or the aftermath of the fever, she was always weak. She frequently fell ill and was not good at sports. Because of this, Kang Minhee visited the shaman more often. More precisely, her mother often dragged her there.

Every time they visited, the shaman performed strange rituals, claiming to exorcise the ghost possessing Kang Minhee. However, even as she entered elementary school, moved to higher grades, and became a middle school student, the shaman continued the rituals but could not exorcise the ghost.

"What's going on!? The ghost's power is growing stronger over time! Today, I'll borrow the power of the General directly to exorcise it! Tell the manager about the ritual fee."

"Unbelievable! Is there really such a big ghost!? Today, I'll receive the General's spirit directly and manifest him in this world to exorcise it! Manager, calculate today's ritual fee."

"I'll stake my life as a shaman to exorcise you, evil spirit! Manager! Call all the General and the Heaven and Earth Dragon Gods for a grand ritual and schedule it! Inform Minhee's mother about the ritual fee as well."

The shaman, who often called for the manager more than the General she served, changed her attitude when Kang Minhee entered her first year of high school.

"Hee, heeek! Ah, I see. It wasn't a ghost. It wasn't a big ghost that possessed you! You! You are! You were the shadow I saw! You weren't human from the start; you were a ghost born in a human body! Hee, heeheek...! Wait. If the shadow is you, then what is attached to you? The divination clearly showed something attached...! That, that, that, that...! General, General, where are you going! General!!!!! Don't leave me...grrrk...!?"

The shaman, who had said there was a big ghost, suddenly foamed at the mouth and collapsed. After being taken to the emergency room, she lost all her memories and became an imbecile. It was said that she retained only the intelligence of a three-year-old.

Kang Minhee's mother, who had already been doubting the shaman's ability to exorcise the ghost, lost interest in shamanism after this incident. Instead, she became a Christian and started attending church, but Kang Minhee did not go. Instead, she began learning judo. Despite her weak body, she wanted to believe that being born weak was not due to something like a ghost. She wanted to become strong, even if she was weak.

However, it seemed that the shaman's words about being possessed by a ghost were not entirely false. From the moment she stopped visiting the shaman, Kang Minhee began to see a shadow following her. She did not tell her mother, fearing she would be dragged to church. Instead, she focused more on exercise and her studies. She firmly believed that the black shadow was a psychological issue and took an interest in psychology and neuroscience. But nothing could rid her of the black shadow.

Gradually, the shadow became more distinct. Sometimes it took the form of her mother, sometimes a friend, sometimes the shaman, and sometimes her father, whom she had never met. As she progressed through high school, the shadow became so distinct that it was hard to compare it to a person. And one day, the shadow spoke to her.

"Hello?"

Kang Minhee ignored it. From that day on, strange things began happening around her. They were not major incidents, but she often got bird droppings on her, her umbrella disappeared on rainy days, or she narrowly avoided accidents. Her luck seemed to have worsened, especially for those close to her, who suffered even greater misfortunes. Soon, rumors spread at school, and people avoided her.

The shadow spoke to her.

"If you hold a knife in your mouth and look in the mirror at midnight, you'll see your future husband. Let's try it. You have talent, so you'll succeed."

Kang Minhee ignored it.

"Let's draw the talisman the shaman used. I'll help you. The talisman you draw will be effective. I guarantee it."

"Aren't you interested in the magic potions used by witches? I'll teach you how to make them."

"Aren't you curious about the power and wisdom contained in the reverse pentagram?"

Strangely, the shadow, which always whispered occult or sinister knowledge and curses to Kang Minhee, began using that power directly.

"I tried it for you. I held a knife in my mouth and looked in the mirror at midnight, and I saw your future husband. Surprisingly, you won't get married. You have no fate with men."

It arbitrarily predicted Kang Minhee's fate.

"I drew a talisman for you. Give it to someone you don't like as a gift. It will be effective."

One day, she woke up to find her room covered in talismans made of A4 paper.

"Remember the boy who said he liked you? I got his hair and put it in a doll and stabbed it. He probably won't come to school for half a year."

As the shadow grew stronger, more distinct, and able to speak like a person, Kang Minhee had no choice but to acknowledge it. She was indeed haunted by a ghost. And this ghost...

"No one can match you. You don't even know how great you are. Don't worry. I'll keep away anyone who doesn't match your level. I'll make sure they can't approach you."

It scattered misfortune around her, preventing anyone from approaching her. Kang Minhee could not make friends. After realizing this, she built a wall to keep people from getting close to her. She always smiled in front of others but discarded all emotions behind their backs. People she kept at a distance did not suffer as much misfortune. Instead, she immersed herself in dramas and movies. The fictional characters in them could be loved without bringing misfortune.

Her dream of a secret office romance while watching dramas was for this reason. This attitude continued until she got a job at a bath products company.

"...? Where did it go?"

At some point, the shadow disappeared. She felt like she could fly. The shadow that always recited ominous prophecies seemed to have been washed away by the soap from the bath products company.

"I'll stay at this company."

She felt like she could fly. A sense of liberation. Her first job. Colleagues who took care of the new employees. And, a colleague who subtly took care of her during her first company dinner. Coincidentally, they had the same commute and shared a longing for an office romance. Everything aligned, and she started dating Seo Eunhyun.

At first, she felt like she could fly. But all those thoughts reversed when Seo Eunhyun spilled coffee. It was coffee that should never have spilled. But when Kang Minhee saw it, 'someone' had pushed Seo Eunhyun's back. Seo Eunhyun bumped into it and spilled coffee on Oh Hyunseok's documents. The usually kind Oh Hyunseok was unusually furious that day. He scolded Seo Eunhyun for 90 minutes after work, and Kang Minhee broke out in a cold sweat during that time.

It hadn't disappeared. She wasn't free. It had just been invisible for a while. The day after Seo Eunhyun gave her an umbrella and caught a cold, Kang Minhee made a decision. Before Seo Eunhyun got deeper into her heart, she would drive it away.

After that, Kang Minhee tried her best to break up with Seo Eunhyun. She deliberately took him on drives and smoked heavily in the car. When he tried to pour sauce, she flipped the table. When he ordered seasoned chicken, she insisted on fried. She forced him to eat mint chocolate. Eventually, they broke up. Kang Minhee remembered that she was the one who suggested the breakup. She didn't remember the details, but they broke up after a confusing conversation.

However, Seo Eunhyun's misfortune continued. Jeon Myunghoon kept getting annoyed with him, and Seo Eunhyun kept losing weight as if something was wrong. So she decided to resign. She went to Seo Eunhyun, made a non-excuse excuse, and said she would resign. She didn't remember the details, but the president saw her proposal and raised her salary.

And then, she saw the shadow again next to the president.

"Stay here. I did a divination, and it said you'll have an endless future if you stay here."

She tried to ignore the shadow's words, but it climbed onto Seo Eunhyun's neck and spoke to her.

"Stay. The divination is good."

"..."

Kang Minhee had no choice but to stay. She was always praised at the company and quickly promoted. But she was never at ease. The shadow always followed her, and the thought of never escaping it suffocated her.

And then, one day, a landslide occurred, and she fell into Deungseonhyang. Upon arriving at Deungseonhyang, she noticed something unusual before anyone else. The shadow that had followed her all her life was gone. It was no longer visible.

After being kidnapped to Heuksaek Gwigolgok, she began learning the Ghost Dao techniques. She guessed that her shadow was a kind of Ghost King. A very powerful Ghost King, at least at the level of Wonyeonggi. So she trained with all her might to raise her level, preparing to subdue the Ghost King if she ever met it again. She trained with all her might.

Thus, she became a Black Elder. On the day she reached the Sacrificial Stage, she had a glimmer of hope. Maybe the Ghost King would never appear again. But then, a disciple named Seorip arrived. Seeing Seorip for the first time, Kang Minhee felt a strong sense of déjà vu. She was sure she had seen him somewhere. She had never been wrong about this kind of feeling, so she thought he was someone she had seen before. No, she thought he was a person.

Seorip had an unusually strong aura of death, something only a ghost could have. Moreover, Seorip occasionally did things similar to Seo Eunhyun. 'What is this?' She considered the possibility that Seo Eunhyun had sent a clone to Heuksaek Gwigolgok. But Seo Eunhyun wouldn't do that. Why would he secretly send a clone to Heuksaek Gwigolgok where she was? Jeon Myunghoon or Oh Hyeseo might, but Seo Eunhyun had no reason to do such a thing. Moreover, Seorip sometimes did things like the combing or massages she had taught Seo Eunhyun.

It wasn't Seo Eunhyun's clone. There was only one possibility left. The shadow. The entity that had followed her. It had finally reappeared, this time as a disciple of Heuksaek Gwigolgok. It seemed visible to others. So she couldn't hastily conclude. Since the shadow was visible to others, she couldn't be sure if it was the same shadow she knew. So Kang Minhee decided to see it with her own eyes.

And after seeing it with her Ghost Eyes, she could make a judgment. It was that shadow. The same, or even darker than that shadow. A form of death that seemed to crawl up from the depths of the underworld! And the subtle atmosphere similar to Seo Eunhyun. Finally, she realized. The Seorip in front of her was that damn shadow that had followed her. Or at least related to it.

After feeling the shadow's touch reminiscent of Seo Eunhyun, Kang Minhee made a decision. If so, 'I'll kill you and find out your true identity.' It was time to get rid of the shadow that had tormented her.
