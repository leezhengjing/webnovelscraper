Holding Hands (5)

What does "Zuo Ta Li Wang" mean? Literally, it means to sit and enter nirvana. It signifies the ability to control life and death freely and to perform astral projection at will. The "one strike" of "Yuzhen Yi Bu" was akin to my doppelganger, so if one considered it as astral projection, that would be correct as well. However, there were parts I didn't understand, so I asked, "Why did you name it but never call it?"

"...What good is it if I alone reach the supreme state? It's a state reached by cutting down friends. Even if the meaning is understood, it’s too much to say I simply sat and entered nirvana, given all that happened."

"Is that so..."

It seemed he still felt guilty about Qingmenling, hence he didn't properly call the name he had given the state.

"Anyway, did you see anything else?"

"...I did."

What Kim Younghoon showed in the form of a dance was a clue to the next state. And even though I was a slow learner, I hadn't spent all my time holding a sword in vain, so I could understand that clue as well. Beyond Zuo Ta Li Wang. To reach the place also called "Yuzhen Er Bu," we must draw out all the possibilities within us. Just as Kim Younghoon triggered his potential by laying blood vessels on his demonic sword and demon blades. Just as Taeyeoljeon drew power from deep within his mind. Drawing out all possible potentials was the key to the next state.

So how does one draw out other possibilities with a mortal body? Zuo Ta Li Wang was not only Kim Younghoon's nickname for Yuzhen Yi Bu but also the method of training for this state. It is both "Li Wang" (standing death) and "Ru Wang" (entering death). One must forget. In other words, one must sever. All attachments to one's past, all fears about one's destiny. Sever and forget all of it, leaving only the 'present moment' to reach true emptiness (kong) and thus the state beyond Zuo Ta Li Wang.

I understood why Kim Younghoon said he couldn't reach the next state.

"...You can't sever it."

"..."

Indeed. To reach this state, one must sever and forget everything. But the only reason he could come this far was because of the emotion called longing. To tell him to forget everything was akin to telling Kim Younghoon to throw away his identity. Kim Younghoon looked at his sword with powerless eyes.

"How can a person sever all their ties?"

"..."

I watched him and sighed. If severing everything was the key to the next state, then...

'I too cannot reach the next state.'

How can one say they can sever all their ties without hesitation? Hearing his words made me feel endlessly gloomy. I had found the way to the next state. But it was an impossible method.

"...Damn it."

Kim Younghoon made a dejected expression and swung his sword. The surface of the dimension he stood on rippled along the trajectory of his sword.

"That's why I asked Oh Hyunseok to train me. No matter how much I train... it might really be impossible to reach the next state."

"..."

He stood still, holding his sword as if it tasted bitter, then stepped on the surface of the deep sea and headed towards the distant Guangyin Region.

"I wanted to confirm if the enlightenment I realized was truly correct, so I asked for a match."

"...You say strange things. This is the first time I'm hearing about the clue to the next state from you, so why do you say you realized it by clashing with me?"

"That's because... you are already embodying the enlightenment of the next state, aren't you?"

"What...?"

I asked in confusion, and Kim Younghoon chuckled.

"It seems you haven't realized it yet, but you already possess the same level of enlightenment as me, embodied in your body. That's why I gained enlightenment by clashing with you."

"Such..."

"There's no need to explain it in detail to you. Once you have the opportunity, you'll realize it on your own, and it's best to realize it yourself. Anyway, I've confirmed the enlightenment. I will... go to Oh Hyunseok and train a bit more in that extension technique."

With those words, Kim Younghoon returned to the Guangyin Region. I stood there for a moment, unable to speak. The surroundings were still filled with countless illusions. I understood why Kim Younghoon had cut down one of the illusions. The night sea of the Gaolijie reflected the past of the target, and Kim Younghoon had tried to cut down his past. Of course, knowing it was impossible, he had left again.

"..."

I quietly looked around the night sea.

"...Mansang Inyeondo."

Tsu-tsu-tsu-tsut! The colorless glass sword hummed, emitting a hazy mist around it. It seemed like a hazy fog appeared over the sea of Gaolijie. And within that mist, countless cherished connections appeared.

Uuuung—

The entire Mansang Inyeondo resonated with something, as if in harmony with the nature of Gaolijie. Of course, it wasn't awakening some hidden power or potential; it was just resonating together. For a while, I floated above the night sea and reached out to them.

Srrrk—

My hand passed through their illusions. They couldn't be grasped. They were clearly connections I had made before, but now they were just illusions that couldn't be grasped. Reaching out into the void and reminiscing about old memories had become a habit of mine. It seemed like a foolish act, but I couldn't stop. I felt that if I kept reaching out, I might eventually grasp them. When I was struggling, spouting nonsense like 'a civilized person from Earth,' it wasn't without reason. Even if it was meaningless, I felt that if I kept repeating it, I might return there. This act was the same. Even if it was meaningless, I felt that if I kept reaching out, I might grasp them again.

But to reach the next state, I have to sever this...?

"...Impossible."

Pasa-sak—

When I reached out, the hazy mist scattered. The surroundings were once again just the night sea. I seemed to understand the contradiction that Kim Younghoon was trapped in. To return home, one must cultivate martial arts or training to reach a higher state. But if one doesn't give up the initial goal, they can't reach the next state. It was a situation where the tail was wagging the dog. But what should I do?

"...Even reaching the Haptigi state is manageable."

Haptigi was still somewhat manageable if I built up the Five Blessings and realized the Six Extremes to complete the Jichukgi. But the Swaeseonggi. And beyond Zuo Ta Li Wang, I couldn't grasp it at all. Could I really reach it? Even the difference between Swaeseonggi and the states below it was insane. I usually thought that if I pushed the Samtaegeuk to the extreme, I could have a good fight with someone two states above me, but even if I reached the Haptigi Daewonman with the Samtaegeuk, it was uncertain if I could handle the insane Il Su of Kang Minhee.

"...Why am I doing this?"

Suddenly, I had a fundamental question about why I was doing this. Was it because I was out here alone at night? Random thoughts came to mind, and eventually, a heart demon (simma) began to gnaw at my mind.

—Why do you live?

Another illusion of myself appeared before my eyes.

—A life that's not really living. You have no interest in anything other than breaking the cycle of regression. You spend your whole life trying to get stronger, running around with sweat on your feet to save people like Kang Minhee and Kim Yeon, even though you know it won't work... Do you know how pitifully foolish you look from the side?

"..."

—Do you think things will change if you save them? You know that fate is fixed. Even if you save them, they'll become unhappy again. Why not just abandon all those connections, hide away in some remote place, train for a thousand years, become a true immortal, and then regress to save everyone? Isn't that the best way? You know it is, right?

"..."

The illusion of 'me' wore black clothes and had 19 heads. It whispered to me.

—So, kill yourself right now and optimize the method a bit more...

"So what?"

But I looked up at the heart demon with empty eyes. I hadn't told anyone, but this type of heart demon frequently tormented my mind. However, I had never been devoured by any of them.

"So what if I die? What then?"

I looked down at the heart demon with hollow eyes. It began to shrink.

Even if I die, I come back to life. Watching Seorip die peacefully with a smile, I was insanely jealous and filled with resentment. I was so envious of him. Cultivators have various reasons for training. Immortality, infinite power, vast knowledge, new truths. Exploration of the world, or complex grudges. Not wanting to be swayed by others, or simply because it seemed to suit them and progress was smooth. But I dare to say, I am training for a reason different and alien to any other cultivator in the Three Thousand Worlds.

"I want to die too...!"

Kwa-deuk!

I grabbed the heart demon in front of me and opened my mouth.

Waduk, waduduk, waduk!

The heart demon with 19 heads was torn apart in my mouth. It struggled, but I didn't let go. Despite encountering countless heart demons, I had never gone completely mad. The reason was that I myself was my greatest heart demon. Even if I go mad, it’s useless. In the first cycle, I went mad, shouting about being a civilized person from Earth. It was useless. Everything became nothing. After that, I went mad with work and achieved almost everything, though somewhat unsatisfactorily. It was useless. Everything became nothing. I became stronger, learned the secrets of the world, gained recognition for my position, lost precious people, gained and lost precious people again, gained valuable experiences, made dear friends, acquired many truths and powers, and my position rose rapidly again... It was all useless. Everything became nothing. At least a few cycles were fixed, and I managed to hold onto a few connections. But!

"There's still more left!"

Regression!

It hasn't disappeared!

In the end, I never mentioned regression because of Yang Sujin's warning. But because of that, it felt like my heart was burning even more.

Chwaaa!

I punched with all my might. The power I had accumulated to reach this point caused a ripple, and the deep sea surged. After devouring the heart demon, I realized why it had suddenly appeared.

'...Because I heard I had to sever everything.'

I can't sever it. I've already lost everything several times in the flow of time. Because of the curse of regression, several times! I knew Kim Younghoon wasn't lying about the next state. If he provided a clue to the next state, it was correct. Therefore, his words that one must sever everything to reach the next state were also correct. And I felt the Samtaegeuk rising behind me. Recently, I had begun to understand.

'The cultivation methods of the Tianji Clan are becoming similar.'

Until the Tianrenqi, the cultivation methods of the Tianji Clan differed, but from the Sachukgi, even if it was the Tianji Dual Cultivation, the path of power and the method of expressing power, and the amount of power that could be contained within the body, did not differ much. And according to what was passed down, at the Swaeseonggi, the cultivation methods of the Tianji Clan were almost indistinguishable. I also knew the Swaeseonggi ascension ritual well. It was fully disclosed at the Taesuhui for those who might want to become a Zunja beyond the Taesu. However, even the Haptigi Daewonman Junje, the late-stage Golmaek, and the once late-stage Heonwon only stayed at the late-stage Haptigi and did not attempt to become a Zunja.

'The Swaeseonggi ascension ritual is similar to what Kim Younghoon mentioned.'

Interestingly, just as the ranks of Qi, Soul, and Life are essentially one, the cultivation methods of the Tianji Clan become similar in the later stages. I didn't know if it was the return of all things, but now there was only one way to reach the next state. Abandoning! Ruthlessly abandoning what I absolutely cannot abandon! That was the way to rise higher.

"How... can I abandon it..."

The reason the heart demon came and whispered nonsense and was devoured by me was simple. There was no answer. The state must be raised, but the path ahead was blocked. No matter how much time I put in! How could I possibly use that method? Previously, no matter how daunting the state, I had a faint hope that if I poured in enough time, I could achieve it. But now I knew. There are things that cannot be achieved even with time. Just as the heart demon ignorantly babbled, even if I poured in a thousand years, even a million years, such a method was impossible. At least for me! Having faced countless heart demons and experienced such despair many times, I could predict my next actions. I would still train, challenging the extreme of Zuo Ta Li Wang. Then I would raise all my cultivation states to the Haptigi. If I raised the Tianji Dual Cultivation to the Haptigi Daewonman, it would be quite useful. Perhaps I might even be able to attempt an escape in front of the Swaeseonggi. But I knew the outcome. I would hit the wall again and wail for a thousand years, even a million years. It wasn't a matter of talent. It was a matter of whether I could abandon it or not.

"...Damn it."

I cursed quietly as I looked at the deep sea that had returned to its original state. I saw something wriggling below. It seemed like a deep-sea monster was eyeing me.

Chwaaa!

A whale-like monster covered in countless illusions opened its mouth and leaped at me. Bwoong! It was a monster at the level of the Sachukgi Daewonman, but I roughly split it and took out a head-sized core from inside. The deep-sea monster was not a living creature but a kind of 'record' that took shape, made up of countless histories within the dimension. Therefore, it floated above the deep sea for a few moments before dissolving and disappearing. Tsu-tsu-tsu-tsut— The deep-sea monster, made of past records, seemed to dissolve into the void, and its corpse scattered into the air. The countless remnants of the past inside the deep-sea monster scattered. As I stared blankly at the scene, a faint green remnant passed by me. And within that remnant, I saw a neighboring family carrying a large coffin up a mountain with someone. The family was a middle-aged couple climbing the mountain with a little girl. The girl was the daughter of the neighboring Joo family.

"...Wait."

I was wide-eyed as I approached the remnant. At that moment, pa-tsu-tsu! The remnant from the deep-sea monster gathered in the air and turned into a green beast. The information entity from the deep-sea monster had reformed into a small deep-sea monster.

"Wait!"

I lunged at the green beast. It had the shape of a deer, and as I lunged, it immediately started to flee.

Toong— Toong—

I was wide-eyed as I watched the deep-sea monster.

"...Wait, what are you?"

I started chasing the deer. In the mysterious night sea of Gaolijie, a chase began between me and the green deer. The deer leaped across the sea like Kim Younghoon. I kept chasing its tail, but strangely, it only got farther away instead of closer.

"Stop...! Stop there!"

I chased the deer with bloodshot eyes.

"Stop!!! Stop right there!!!"

Chwaaa!

I used all methods, including the Bi-dun Technique, the Shrinking Earth Technique, the Gliding Technique, and Sword Flight, to chase the deer. But the deer never got closer. I gritted my teeth and shouted at the deer.

"Come back! Come back!!!"

But the deer evaded me and fled far away, leaving me floating in the dark sea, having lost it.

"...What was that..."

It was strange. I had run at full power for a long time. I had flown back and forth across this dimensional sea several times, but not only did I not catch it, the sea seemed endlessly vast.

"What did I see?"

When I came to my senses, I hadn't strayed far from where I had caught the whale-like deep-sea monster.

"Tell me too."

"Never mind. It seems the deep-sea monster showed me an illusion."

I sighed and held my head.

'Did I go mad?'

If Kim Younghoon had been nearby, he would have prepared for me falling into an illusion, but since he had left and I was alone in the night sea of Gaolijie, I must have briefly fallen into an illusion.

"...That was close."

I shook my head. It seemed Kim Younghoon was right about the dangers of staring at the night sea of Gaolijie for too long. I looked back at the place where I had caught the whale monster. The illusions had all scattered and disappeared, leaving only the rippling sea of dimensions.

"...I should go back."

I had thought a single deep-sea monster wasn't very dangerous, but after seeing that bizarre illusion, I changed my mind. I used the Shrinking Earth Technique to fly back to the distant Guangyin Region.

Kugugugu!

The Guangyin Region had already reached the edge of the air bubble. The wall of the firmament was now in sight.

Chwaaa!

The blue 'horizon' I had seen in Seongran-do was right before my eyes.

'It looks just like the scenery in the Water Realm.'

Just like the Water Realm, this place also had the edge of the horizon cut off. However, while the Water Realm had the World Barrier blocking the end of the world, this sea had 'seawater' rising vertically to form a wall of 'deep sea' that extended endlessly into the sky, forming the firmament. To cross to another sea, one had to cross this wall.

'Let's see... When crossing the wall, either Yeonwi or Seoran, or one of the two, asked to be called...'

Seoran and Siho looked very busy, and Bukhyanghwa was whining, drunk, while Kim Yeon, equally drunk, was sucking on her hair. I shook my head and looked at Yeonwi. Fortunately, Yeonwi was playing a game with Yukyo, who had been somewhat healed.

"I should ask Yeonwi."

I sent a telepathic message to Yeonwi, and she, losing the game to Yukyo, flipped the board and took the stakes, then entered the room where Jeon Myeonghun and Yeon
