### Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 375: At Sea (3)

In the midst of everything, I noticed that Hamjin's cultivation level had significantly increased.

"Hamjin, you've already reached the late stage of the Foundation Establishment realm."

With a swift movement, I arrived at the middle region of another star and asked, "It seems you've had quite the fortuitous encounter. Congratulations. What new divine ability have you acquired?"

In response, Hamjin moved his body to form a hand seal, drawing power from his dantian and channeling it to his fingertips.

'This is...?'

The power of Hamjin's 'Earth Seal of the Black Blade' transformed into a dark, inky light, resembling the darkness of space. When Hamjin swung his hand, the inky light turned into a black blade, 'Black Blade,' which flew towards a small mountain on the star and sliced it in half.

Rumble!

"......!"

A clear strike at the level of the Core Formation stage!

"...Impressive. Did you create this after witnessing the Celestial Sovereign Hamcheon cut through a star?"

Judging by its form, it seemed to be a divine ability created from an epiphany gained during a strike from Zhang Yi.

'Indeed, even at the Foundation Establishment stage, witnessing a Core Formation stage strike would be enough to create a divine ability.'

Although using this technique drained all of Hamjin's power, the 'Earth Seal of the Black Blade' was a technique that continuously drew power from the ley lines, so it wasn't a significant drawback. Once he reached the Core Formation stage, he would be able to use it freely, and it would become a life-saving technique for Hamjin.

Buzz!

As we moved through the middle region again, I asked Hamjin, "What is the name of this technique?"

"Black Blade Slash... It's an excellent name."

Nodding, I created a supplementary technique on the spot to enhance the 'Black Blade Slash' and a method to refine it. This combined technique was called 'Black Blade Growth Technique.'

Over several days and nights, we traversed countless middle regions and finally arrived back in Hamjin's world.

Boom!

"Phew...."

I emerged from Hamjin's body and congratulated the exhausted Hamjin.

"Thank you. I've gained a lot from your cooperation."

"No, I am the one who has received an excessive amount of fortuitous encounters!"

"I will grant you a spiritual fruit to extend your lifespan in the future. Until then, let's meet again in the Upper Realm."

With a flash, I withdrew my consciousness and smiled at Hamjin, who bowed deeply as I returned to the High Power Realm.

* * *

Watching Seo Eunhyun disappear into the void, Hamjin looked at his fingertips.

Crackle!

His nails turned black for a moment, and a sharp black blade appeared on his hand.

'Black Blade Growth Technique... To bestow such an excellent technique upon me. How can I repay this grace?'

After some contemplation, Hamjin made a decision.

'Yes, he told me to meet him in the Upper Realm. I will ascend! I will become a Celestial Being, a realm my master couldn't reach, and ascend to the Upper Realm! There, I will serve the great Infinite King and properly join the Infinite Sect!'

He finally set his life's goal: to ascend and repay the grace he received by serving beside the Infinite King.

Whoosh!

When Hamjin swung his hand, a sharp black blade shot out and cut through a nearby cliff.

"I will refine this black blade countless times and definitely reach him!"

Thus, the legend of Hamjin, the Black Blade King, who would become a Core Formation stage sage, was just beginning.

* * *

Blink-

I opened my eyes.

'Having focused all my consciousness on fighting Zhang Yi, my main body must have been in a comatose state for a while.'

My companions must have been quite surprised.

'I should explain properly... Hmm!'

Clank, clank!

For some reason, my body and limbs were bound to a chair, and my mouth was gagged. Candles were placed on my hands, knees, and head, with wax dripping down. In front of me, Yeonwi, dressed like a shaman, was performing a ritual with a mountain of stones piled around her.

"Hah...! Look, look...! The leader has awakened!"

She stopped the ritual, wiped her sweat, and approached me.

"Are you alright? Did some deep-sea monster hit you with a deep-sea curse?"

I used telepathy to ask questions since my mouth was gagged, and Yeonwi explained about the deep-sea curse. She said they had gathered stones from the entire sea area to treat the curse.

I was grateful but couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity. Hearing my thoughts, Yeonwi fell silent for a moment, then angrily struck my head with the bell she was holding.

"You scoundrel! Judging by the way you speak, you're not the leader but an evil spirit possessing his body! Get out of that body immediately, evil spirit!"

Jingle, jingle!

After being hit several times with the bell, which affected my spiritual body, I sighed and exerted my strength.

Crack, crack!

The chains binding me broke, and the gag shattered.

"You, you scoundrel... Gah!?"

Grabbing Yeonwi's face, I lifted her and subdued her, then used a palm strike to shake her brain and knock her out. She rolled her eyes and fainted on the spot. I then summoned Hongbeom.

Flash!

Hongbeom appeared before me, bowing deeply.

"Master, have you returned? Was Yeonwi's method effective?"

"Hmm...."

After explaining the truth to Hongbeom, I asked, "Did anything happen while I was in a comatose state?"

Hongbeom's face turned pale. I sensed that something had indeed happened.

"...Let's go to the conference room."

* * *

Infinite Sect Conference Room.

There, I heard an unbelievable report.

"...So, while the leaders were away gathering stones, Yukyo and Baekrin, along with... Bukhyanghwa and Kim Yeon, were kidnapped by the Tuma Pirates...?"

Crack-

With a grim face, Hongbeom spoke.

"To be precise... When Yukyo and Baekrin were kidnapped, the two kings rushed to rescue them and were also captured. That's why Yeonwi tried to wake you up early...."

"...Where are they now?"

"The Tuma Pirates' ship, the Bone Ship, has the ability to dive into the deep sea of the High Power Realm. They are currently roaming the deep sea."

"...Do they usually mistreat their hostages?"

At my question, Kim Younghoon shook his head.

"Probably not. The Tuma Pirates are mostly composed of Tuma nobles, with the remaining being non-human Yao tribes. The Tuma nobles... resemble humans but have a unique way of reproducing."

"Reproducing...?"

"Yes. They... engage in combat with their chosen partners while mating. Thus, they experience extreme pleasure during battle, making them crazy. Therefore, they usually ignore and neglect those they capture who can't fight."

Hearing this, Jeon Myunghoon shuddered with a horrified expression.

"...So, when that guy fought me...."

"Enough with the chatter."

Whoosh-

My breath turned into frost, causing the conference room to freeze.

"From now on, we will find them and rescue our sect members."

Focusing my icy gaze, I began to track Kim Yeon's location. Since Kim Yeon was connected to me through the 'Strange Heart Sutra,' I could locate her with time.

'Just wait a little longer.'

Thinking of Bukhyanghwa and Kim Yeon, I gritted my teeth.

* * *

Deep inside the High Power Realm's deep sea, within the Bone Ship.

Inside a prison cell, two women were arguing.

"You shouldn't have rushed in so recklessly!"

"You should have run to inform others! What were you thinking?"

Bukhyanghwa and Kim Yeon were locked in adjacent cells, their limbs bound, arguing.

"Are you telling me to abandon our members and run?"

"Your loyalty is commendable! But now we're both stuck here!"

After arguing for a while, they sighed, exhausted.

"What a mess...."

"Indeed...."

Soon, the cell next to theirs opened, and Yukyo was thrown inside. The Tuma warriors who threw Yukyo also tossed Baekrin into the adjacent cell, laughing as they moved away.

Kim Yeon looked at Yukyo. Although the Tuma warriors didn't usually mistreat their captives, Yukyo seemed to be frequently dragged in front of Jinmayeol for abuse.

"...Sigh... We need to escape soon."

At Kim Yeon's words, Bukhyanghwa scoffed.

"How do you plan to escape? Even if we get out, the Bone Ship is submerged in the deep sea, so we can't get out."

"I've piloted your Bukhyangham before, so I think I can pilot this ship too."

"Dream on. My Bukhyangham was half-automated, so it was possible to control it. The Bone Ship is entirely manual. You won't have a chance to take control."

Hearing this, Kim Yeon suddenly asked Bukhyanghwa, "Then... can't you modify this Bone Ship into your Bukhyangham?"

"What?"

"Last time, you quickly modified the ship I took control of. Can't you do the same with this one?"

"It's possible, but... how? We're both tied up."

"Hmm...."

Kim Yeon smiled and moved her arms a few times. Suddenly, the chains binding her arms snapped.

Seeing this, Bukhyanghwa's eyes widened.

"Breaking the power-suppressing chains... with brute strength...?"

"Power is suppressed, but internal energy isn't."

Kim Yeon smiled gently.

"Of course, I can't win in a direct fight with those Tuma warriors. I'll free you, so modify the ship as quickly as possible and escape. Got it?"

Crack!

Bending the bars, Kim Yeon moved to Bukhyanghwa's cell and freed her cuffs. Bukhyanghwa stared at her in a daze before smiling.

"Alright, sister."

* * *

Jinmayeol, the leader of the Tuma Pirates, stood in his captain's cabin, looking out with a cold expression. The Bone Ship, with its heavily compressed space, was as large as a small city inside.

Boom!

Jinmayeol gazed out the window at the deep-sea scenery.

"I need to obtain it soon. That fish-headed Yukyo...."

Grinding his teeth, he glared at the giant sea dragon statue deep in the sea.

"The secret technique of 'Purple Soul Fills the Sky' is within reach...."

Jinmayeol's eyes gleamed with strange excitement as he looked at the sea dragon statue.

"Yes... just a little longer. Then, I will achieve immortality with a mortal body!"
