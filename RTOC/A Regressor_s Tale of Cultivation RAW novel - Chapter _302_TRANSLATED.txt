‘What should I do? Should I call it a surprise magic trick? That's crazy. Should I put it back in my mouth? No, what would they think of me? Should I say I have a chronic illness? But I'm already at the level of Yuan Ying, what kind of chronic illness could I have? Or maybe….’

While my mind was spinning, Kang Minhee approached me. I felt even more tense, as if my head was about to explode. Considering Kang Minhee's personality and the severity of the punishments in the Black Ghost Valley, I might end up working in the labor camp with my powers sealed for ten days or become a test subject for some bizarre investigations for a few days.

At that moment, she spoke.

“Are you okay, Seolip?”

Kang Minhee asked, placing her hand on my forehead.

“Ah….”

Come to think of it, I was so caught up in my mistake that I didn't read her intentions. Kang Minhee was worried about me.

“I'm fine. I'm sorry for showing you such a disgraceful sight.”

“Disgraceful sight? You vomited blood. You don't look fine at all.”

“Ah… this is….”

I thought about how to explain it and came up with something appropriate.

“This is a side effect of the technique I practiced before ascending to the Guanghan Realm. It's just a little blood, so please don't worry.”

“Hmm, really?”

However, I realized something was wrong. Her intentions were growing colder.

“My friends say otherwise. They say you're lying.”

“…!”

It seemed that some of the ghosts who had practiced demonic arts recognized techniques like the Blood Demon True Sea Light or the Blood Chain Forest Formation.

“I have many friends. Among them, there's one with excellent medical skills who says your symptoms are caused by internal turmoil.”

“…I see…. I'm sorry for lying.”

“Hoo….”

She sighed and gestured for me to come closer.

“Come here. I'll give you some medicine.”

“…! No, I couldn't possibly….”

“It's an order. Come here. Don't go somewhere else and vomit blood again, get treated here.”

I followed her into her office, feeling bewildered. Some ghosts were cleaning up the blood I had vomited behind me.

‘Damn, I just came to raise my favorability and say hello….’

Because the main body suddenly saw something strange, I ended up in this mess. She reached into a cabinet in her office and took out a few pills the size of eyeballs.

“Here. These are Yin Zhu Pills. They're very effective for internal injuries.”

“May I ask what these pills are made of…?”

“Why? Do you have allergies?”

“Yes… something like that.”

“Hmm, let's see. They're made of Zhilao Grass, which is good for internal injuries, dried leaves of Guiyanghua that grow in the Yin-rich areas of the Black Ghost Valley, bamboo called Guizhu that grows in swamps, and… ugh. White Bone Toad dung??”

It seemed she was listening to her 'friends' for the ingredients.

“And black moss… and mud used for building houses??? Really? Why would they make medicine with that? What? The mud contains the power of consciousness? No, what….”

She seemed momentarily flustered and then asked me.

“It does contain frog dung and mud… but it shouldn't be a problem to eat. So, do you want to take it?”

“Yes. Please give it to me.”

Considering the body of Yuan Yu, I could eat something even worse than dung. Instead, I felt a sense of satisfaction, thinking it was an insult to Yuan Li.

“Hmm. Alright.”

After thanking Kang Minhee, I chewed the pill and activated the Blood Demon True Sea Light. My body was invigorated, and my chest felt refreshed.

“How do you feel? Are you better?”

“Yes. Thanks to you, I feel much better.”

The dirty, disgusting, and nauseating feeling I had from the main body was completely gone. However, I felt a slight worry.

‘The main body has fainted now.’

No, rather than fainting, it was lying in the demon's lair, recovering its strength as if it were sleeping.

The fact that the main body was sleeping was a problem. After reaching the decision stage, I rarely needed sleep or food, and since the death of Xianghua, I hadn't slept properly, determined to avenge Yuan Li. I hadn't often been so exhausted that I needed sleep.

If I had fainted, it was either because I met a very powerful enemy and fought until I lost consciousness, or I endured extreme conditions for over ten years until my powers were completely depleted, or I met a great being.

‘But now, the main body suddenly became strange just by looking at a single painting.’

The physical condition wasn't that bad either. Thanks to the enlightenment given by Taeyuljeon, I learned how to draw power from deep within my unconscious and convert it into vitality through the Invisible Sword.

However, I suddenly felt nauseous and fainted as if I were vomiting. It was a very strange occurrence.

‘Is there something hidden in that painting?’

Maybe there was. If so, it was truly terrifying. Yeon Yi also saw that painting. Perhaps Taeyuljeon was being manipulated by gods like the Seven Flower King or the Future King without even realizing it.

The safety of the main body was my primary concern, and at the same time, I was worried about 'our' safety.

‘The main body has always been me.’

I was Seo Eunhyun, and Seo Eunhyun was Seolip. It was no different from playing with a puppet on one hand and performing ventriloquism. Of course, the resources and the level of the sorcerer used here were too high to be simple ventriloquism.

‘My current situation is like a ventriloquist falling asleep from exhaustion, but the puppet waking up and continuing the ventriloquism.’

It was an absolutely nonsensical situation. So, was the current 'me' the main body 'Seo Eunhyun,' or was I the 'second personality' born from 'Seo Eunhyun'?

I felt a sense of identity confusion. Of course, that didn't mean I was in pain or worried about being truly separated from the main body.

‘If that's the case, then so be it.’

I had the memories of the main body Seo Eunhyun, and at the same time, I had his enlightenment. Whether I was Seolip, Seo Eunhyun, or the second personality born from him, it didn't matter.

I had no desire to possess the main body's body, steal his life and the power of regression, or anything like that. The life and power of regression, and his fate, were themselves a terrible despair and pain. I didn't want to bear it.

‘What worries me is the 'regression'….’

Until now, I was sure that if the main body died, its consciousness would completely transfer to me, making me the main body's resurrection body, and if the resurrection body died, it would regress again. But as signs of separation between the main body and consciousness appeared, one possibility bothered me.

‘If the main body dies, it might regress without resurrecting as me….’

It was a loss for the main body and a huge concern for me.

‘If that happens, what will become of me?’

Would I regress with the main body, or remain in this timeline? It didn't matter either way.

‘Once the main body wakes up, I should consult it about this issue.’

I organized my thoughts and bowed to Kang Minhee in front of me.

“Thank you very much, Elder.”

“Alright. If you're better, that's good. Next time, don't think it's rude and speak up if you're in pain or having a hard time. I hate those who pretend to be fine the most.”

“Haha… is that so?”

“Yes. There was someone like that before. A fool lived in my hometown.”

“What kind of fool?”

“Well, that fool and I… how should I put it? We worked together in a trading company. That fool made a lot of mistakes after joining. Although he corrected them quickly… Anyway, two weeks after joining, he spilled a drink on his superior's seat.”

“….”

I knew what she was talking about, and my mind went blank.

‘Damn it.’

It was my story. The incident where I spilled coffee on Hyungnim Hyunseok's seat.

‘Hyungnim Hyunseok… I thought he was the scariest in the department back then.’

They say when a woman holds a grudge, frost falls in June. Then why doesn't frost fall when a man gets angry? Because a man's anger itself is power. Now, Hyunseok and I got along well, calling each other brothers, and he was a person who smiled a lot and was easy to get along with. But usually, such people are scarier when they get angry.

After work, I was called to the smoking area for an hour and a half and scolded in a standing position. It was the first time I realized that a person could be so terrifying without being hit.

‘Especially when a big, muscular person speaks in a low, serious tone….’

It felt like a lion growling in front of me.

“That idiot waited until his superior finished scolding him and then went home with me. Later, I saw that he was drenched in cold sweat. His legs were so weak he couldn't stand properly… how should I explain it here…. Hmm, a flying artifact? There was a seat on it, so I told him to sit, but he insisted I sit instead.”

Indeed, that happened. She also struggled to wait for me. I remembered that day. Even when we got off the subway, it started raining, and Kang Minhee didn't have an umbrella. At that time, both of us commuted from our homes in southern Gyeonggi Province, not from a rented room, so we took the Shinbundang Line subway from Seoul to Gwanggyo.

One of the reasons I dated her was that our commute overlapped, and we both got off at Gwanggyo.

‘When we got off, all the convenience store umbrellas were sold out, so there was nowhere to buy one….’

Our homes were close to Gwanggyo Station, so I decided to run, and I gave my umbrella to Kang Minhee, who had to go further from Gwanggyo Station.

‘That was a memory too.’

Kang Minhee recounted the event exactly as I remembered, including me giving her the umbrella. However, her feelings about it seemed slightly different from mine.

“That idiot moron came to work the next day with a cold, wandering around all day with a fever. I was so annoyed taking care of him. It was frustrating to see him sniffling all day without being able to speak properly.”

‘I don't think it was that bad….’

In my memory, I was functioning quite normally. But it seemed to have left a different impression on Kang Minhee.

“And even that day, there was something called Excel in my hometown. My superior taught me that day, but because of the cold, I couldn't grasp it properly and kept coming to me for help.”

She laughed as if it were absurd.

“This is what happens when you don't take care of yourself when you need to. The loss spreads to the entire group. Remember this. Don't be like that idiot.”

“….”

Listening to her story, I felt a sense of defiance and asked a question.

“But, excuse me, Elder.”

“What is it?”

“In the story you just told… you said that fool gave you his raincoat when it rained. And he caught a cold the next day.”

“Yes, that's right.”

“Then if you hadn't taken the raincoat, wouldn't you have caught the cold instead?”

“That could have happened. But I'm smarter than that fool.”

She sighed and said.

“If I had caught the cold instead of that fool, I could have learned from him later. He was so stupid that he only understood what I explained to him, but I could understand everything with just one explanation. So, it would have been better for me to learn from that fool. So….”

She drew a formation on the floor to communicate with the spirits of the Ghost Realm and concluded her story with the following words.

“If I could go back in time, I would take the illness instead.”

“….”

The main body woke up again. I explained everything I had experienced and organized all the events that had happened while the main body was asleep, conveying them to its consciousness.

However, I did not convey Kang Minhee's last statement to the main body.
