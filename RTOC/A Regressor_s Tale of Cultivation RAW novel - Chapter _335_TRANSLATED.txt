The Madness of the Old Monster (3)

‘Now, I need to go to the monster army to rescue Kim Yeon, stop the Black Dragon King, rescue Oh Hyunseok with Jeon Myunghoon, and then kidnap Kang Minhee from the side path.’

After formulating my plan, I stepped onto the teleportation array of the Celestial Path and moved to the area where the monster army was currently located.

Swoosh!

Arriving via the teleportation array of the different race, I headed towards the location of the monster army.

Swoosh!

Using the Shrinking Earth technique, I arrived at the visible location of the monster army much faster than before. At this rate, I wouldn’t need Jeon Myunghoon’s Thunder Reversal technique when escaping.

‘…How long would it take to win in a direct confrontation with the monster army?’

I pondered deeply, calculating the power of the monster army and my own.

‘…The monster army is already at the level of the Human Alliance’s Taesuhui at this point.’

Moreover, it wasn’t the injured and weakened Taesuhui, but the fully powered one.

‘I should avoid a direct confrontation.’

I didn’t want to be captured and become General Seo for another thousand years.

‘It’s different if it’s Emperor Seo, but being General Seo again is a bit….’

With such idle thoughts, I arrived near the Mysterious Fortress and raised my magical power.

Swish, swish!

The technique of Bongryeonghyo wrapped around my hands. Silver chains appeared between my hands.

‘Can this heal?’

It was a technique that had a temporary effect on Kang Minhee. But I had a feeling it wouldn’t work this time.

‘Can the madness of the monster army be compared to Kang Minhee’s?’

Of course, the cracks in Kang Minhee’s mind were growing, increasing the likelihood of her becoming the Demon Mother in the future, but at this point, the cracks weren’t large, so Bongryeonghyo could suppress them. However, the madness of the monster army was already at a high level. It couldn’t be healed with just Bongryeonghyo.

Of course, now that I could use my mental image, I was confident I could temporarily stop the madness by striking the monster army’s mental image. But that was all.

Bongryeonghyo might have been more effective than Euihae Eunsan for Kang Minhee, but it was even less useful for the monster army than Euihae Eunsan.

‘Tsk, what a waste.’

Feeling a slight regret, I dispersed the technique of Bongryeonghyo. Then, revealing my hidden presence, I moved to the front of the Mysterious Fortress and shouted.

“Hello, Elder. I am Seo Mo. I have something to give you, so I came to see you.”

Then, a familiar voice was heard. I covered my left hand with Baekran Chukseongmun and my right hand with Eumhon Gwijumun.

Flash!

Boom!

A brilliant light scattered. A large hole was pierced on one side of the Mysterious Fortress. The monster army’s circuit was operating outside the Mysterious Fortress, laying several layers of defensive arrays. But Taesan Yeolje Gong was a technique that divided the energy itself into seven parts and scattered it. No matter how the energy was used for defense, it would just scatter.

Perhaps because the monster army’s circuit and Taesan Yeolje Gong were too incompatible, I could see the monster army inside the Mysterious Fortress, holding [her] hand and looking at me with a bewildered expression.

“…You… you bastard!!!!!! How dare you, how dare you, how dare you…!”

The monster army’s eyes turned over, and he began to tear at his fingers. But I, with an expressionless face, grabbed the ritual and shone my eyes.

Total Celestial Sword. One strike!

This strike, completely imbued with the rank of the soul, pierced the monster army’s mental image, temporarily suppressing his madness.

‘This won’t hold for long.’

I felt the sorrow, anger, pain, and love sleeping inside the monster army. The emotions were boiling so violently that it was impossible to calm the mental image. All I could do was temporarily bring him back to his senses.

While feeling this, I noticed something strange in the monster army’s mental image.

‘Wait, this is….’

It was strange. Perhaps because I had reached this level and entered his mental image, I could understand ‘something.’

‘The monster army… could it be….’

Sensing a clue about the monster army’s madness, I gritted my teeth. I also understood why Seo Hyul couldn’t place the Soul Binding Seal on the monster army.

“…Did you enter my mind?”

The monster army, who had regained his senses, sat in the control room, feeling my mental image, and asked.

“…Yes. But it won’t last long.”

“I see… And since you entered my mind… you must be feeling it now.”

“…Yes.”

Until now, it was thought that the monster army was suffering from madness due to the influence of the Mysterious Fortress. Indeed, it was confirmed that the monster army was somewhat influenced by the Mysterious Fortress. But today, I realized.

“The Elder… is not suffering from madness because of the Mysterious Fortress.”

The monster army gave a bitter smile at my words.

“It’s just my karma. It’s nothing for you to worry about…. Anyway, why did you come all the way here and cause such a commotion?”

“To take your disciple.”

The monster army nodded at my words.

“I see. So, you were the one meeting her in her dreams every time she dreamed.”

The monster army seemed to know that I had met Kim Yeon in her dreams before, nodding his head.

“Take her. But be careful. I will eventually come to find her again. Because… my lifelong goal can only be realized with her.”

“I will be careful. And….”

I looked into the monster army’s eyes and said.

“I will raise Yeon until she can achieve your goal with her own power.”

The monster army’s goal was Yeon’s Yeon. The purpose of the monster army was for Kim Yeon to operate the Mysterious Heart Technique with her vast consciousness and control the Mysterious Fortress to activate Yeon’s Yeon.

The monster army nodded and said.

“Alright, I’ll leave it to you. And….”

The monster army took out something like a magical tool from his bosom and quickly modified it.

‘That’s….’

Just as the monster army had instilled enlightenment into [her] arm in the past life, this time, he was engraving enlightenment into that magical tool. This was possible because my level had risen, allowing the monster army to stay sane for a longer time.

The puppet bees brought Kim Yeon.

“Uh, Eunhyun… Oppa?”

“Kim Yeon.”

When Kim Yeon looked at me in surprise, the monster army looked at her and said.

“I can only say this now while I’m sane, so I’ll tell you now.”

She seemed bewildered by the monster army’s sane appearance. The monster army handed her the magical tool imbued with enlightenment and said.

“I’m sorry for everything. From now on… be happy.”

No more words were needed. The monster army’s madness was returning, and everything necessary was already contained in that magical tool.

I approached Kim Yeon, put my arm around her shoulder, and bowed to the monster army.

“Thank you. Then, we’ll be off….”

Before Kim Yeon could fully grasp the situation, I used the Shrinking Earth technique to leave the place.

The monster army was returning to his madness. There was no more time to waste.

Swoosh!

Using all the movement techniques I could, including the Shrinking Earth technique, the Total Celestial Sword, and the Gliding Technique, I distanced myself from the monster army. Covering thousands of miles in an instant, I felt the mental image clone I had implanted in the monster army being torn apart by his madness, like a raging crowd.

The monster army had fully returned. But he didn’t pursue further, perhaps because the distance had already widened too much.

‘This was the most stable rescue of Yeon I’ve ever done.’

Kim Yeon, still a bit bewildered by the sudden situation, blinked her large eyes.

“Yeon, are you confused?”

Finding her expression somewhat amusing, I chuckled and asked.

“Uh… is this a dream….”

I gently pinched Kim Yeon’s cheek, who still hadn’t come to her senses, and stepped onto the teleportation array of the Celestial Path with her.

“It’s not a dream. Now, let’s… head to the Black Ghost Bone Valley and check the side path.”

Having rescued Kim Yeon, it was now time to save Kang Minhee.

Jijok Jinryongmaeng Bongmyeongju.

In a hidden layer of Bongmyeongju, a gentle-smiling Haeryong tribe monk and a woman in white were smiling and playing Go.

“So, what is it that you want me to help with?”

The woman in white, Oh Hyesuh, asked with a smile, looking at the Haeryong tribe monk, Seo Hyul.

“It’s nothing much. I’d like you to investigate the past of someone I’m monitoring.”

“Oh my, hasn’t only that monster army asked me for such a favor before?”

“Haha, I was curious about what went wrong in the process because something I couldn’t handle was born.”

“Haha, indeed, I’ve heard that the monster army is practically invincible. Even our great lord couldn’t handle him.”

Oh Hyesuh laughed and placed a stone. Seo Hyul blocked the path in front of Oh Hyesuh’s stone and laughed.

“So, will you grant my request?”

“Hmm, well, alright. Who is it?”

Seo Hyul smiled kindly at her words and formed a seal.

Buzz—

For a moment, a face appeared like an illusion in front of Oh Hyesuh.

“It’s a terminal attached to that person. It’s in a somewhat dangerous position, so it could scatter at any time, but it seems he hasn’t noticed it yet. Please use it to look into his past.”

Seeing the face, Oh Hyesuh’s eyes widened.

“Oh my, I know this person! You want to know his past?”

“Yes.”

“Hmm… Seo Eunhyun… Is he someone you fear?”

Oh Hyesuh explained to Seo Hyul about Seo Eunhyun. She told him roughly what kind of person he was, his past, what he liked and disliked, his medical history, how many times he had been to the dentist, his military service, what schools he attended, and what was written in his student records.

Seo Hyul asked questions about concepts he didn’t understand, learning about Seo Eunhyun.

“…Well, anyway, he was just an ordinary person. Just a common guy who was serious about eating….”

“Haha, I see. That’s good to know.”

After listening to Oh Hyesuh’s story from beginning to end, Seo Hyul concluded.

“Most likely, the ‘Seo Eunhyun’ you know is already dead.”

“Oh dear. That’s unfortunate.”

Oh Hyesuh clicked her tongue and cut off Seo Hyul’s path, while Seo Hyul ate Oh Hyesuh’s stone and continued.

“Most likely, his body was taken over by a high-ranking entity. Perhaps his memories, soul, and fate were all taken. The current ‘Seo Eunhyun’ is… not your colleague but an unknown anomaly. Be careful, Hyesuh. You don’t yet know the true existence of myths, so be cautious, very cautious.”

“Oh, even if you say that, aren’t you secretly hoping I’ll mess up and get broken? That way, it’ll be easier to brainwash me?”

“Haha, I have no such thoughts.”

“Hmm, I think I’m starting to understand your way of speaking, great lord….”

Oh Hyesuh glanced at Seo Hyul, and Seo Hyul took the opportunity to completely block Oh Hyesuh’s path and capture her house.

“By the way, didn’t you say you were a colleague? You know an awful lot about Seo Eunhyun. Is your hometown originally a place where information flows so well?”

“Oh my, you know I’m meticulous. I know everything about my colleagues. Especially a younger sibling I cherished, I even found out how many wisdom teeth he had pulled, the shape of his wisdom teeth, and how many centimeters his toenails were when he cut them.”

“Haha, it was indeed your personal hobby.”

“Yes, well, something like that. But it’s sad that it’s so hard to know about you, great lord. Could you tell me about your past?”

“I told you last time. I was born as the son of the previous Haeryong King, Seo Hwi….”

“Oh, I knew that was all lies. And you’re not even Seo Hwi’s son. That body isn’t even your original body. Aren’t you much older?”

Seo Hyul and Oh Hyesuh continued their conversation with smiles, and Oh Hyesuh reached into the illusion Seo Hyul showed her. The shape of a Taiji appeared in her eyes.

‘Hmm?’

Suddenly, Oh Hyesuh smiled inwardly.

‘Oh my, he just rescued Yeon? And what’s that behavior… it’s the same as before? Every little habit, mannerism, the position of his lips when he smiles, everything is the same. And he says he’s possessed by an anomaly?’

She placed a stone in Seo Hyul’s house, which had been completely captured, and her eyes sparkled.

‘He’s talking nonsense. That’s Seo Eunhyun himself. I don’t know why he became an anomaly, but since all seven of us gained strange abilities, it must be because of that.’

She smiled inwardly.

‘Seeing that he rescued Kim Yeon, he must have decided to gather all the comrades. I should also find an opportunity to contact Seo Eunhyun. If I tell him I’m captured by Seo Hyul, he’ll rescue me, right? And I’ll play the double agent between Seo Eunhyun and Seo Hyul. Both seem interesting….’

She decided to contact Seo Eunhyun soon, choosing the side that satisfied her curiosity.

And Seo Hyul looked at Oh Hyesuh and smiled.

“Oh, great lord. I won. You didn’t expect this move, did you?”

“Haha, I can’t beat you, Hyesuh.”

* * *

I returned to the Celestial Path with Kim Yeon, registered her in the Shiyundo Myungjeok, and headed to the entrance of the Demon Realm with her. I planned to wait there until the Black Dragon King arrived or until Oh Hyunseok was rescued, then go to the Black Ghost Bone Valley to rescue Kang Minhee.

Kim Yeon looked at me for a moment and asked.

“Eunhyun Oppa.”

“Hmm, what is it, Yeon?”

“…You said you’re going to the Black Ghost Bone Valley, right?”

“Yes.”

“The Black Ghost Bone Valley… that’s where Minhee Unnie went, right?”

“So?”

Kim Yeon hesitated for a moment, then asked as if she had made up her mind.

“Are you going to see Minhee Unnie?”

I pondered what to say, then realized what she meant.

“You… know.”

“Ah…. Minhee Unnie said she was cheering for you….”

Kim Yeon, who was immediately caught, lowered her head slightly, feeling embarrassed. I shook my head and said.

“I’m not going because I miss Kang Minhee. I just have something to do. She’s just an ex-girlfriend.”

“Is that so…?”

“Yes.”

“…Eunhyun Oppa.”

“Hmm?”

“You’re rescuing Minhee Unnie and me for the same reason, right?”

“What do you mean?”

Feeling a slight unease, I asked. Kim Yeon gave a bitter smile and said.

“When you said you were going to see Minhee Unnie, you showed the same intention as when you rescued me.”

“Ah….”

It seemed I had let my guard down and revealed my intention, thinking I had already rescued Kim Yeon.

“But if you showed the same intention when rescuing Minhee Unnie and me, and you think of Minhee Unnie as just an ex-girlfriend….”

With her next words, I felt as if I had been struck on the back of my head.

“Are you treating me with the same feelings as an ex-girlfriend?”

“Uh, uh?”
