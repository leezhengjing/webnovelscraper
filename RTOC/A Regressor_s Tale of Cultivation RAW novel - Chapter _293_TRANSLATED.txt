### The Avenger (1)

Boom, rumble!

"Damn it, how can a mere mortal possess such power!"

"You, do you think you can get away with this!? Aren't you afraid of the Celestial Clan's bounty!?"

"The Celestial Clan's bounty... I'm sorry, but this is sanctioned by the Black Dragon King."

I smiled faintly as I spoke.

"For the Black Dragon King to enter the True Demon Realm and start the true plan our Dragon Clan has prepared, the entrance to the True Demon Realm must first be cleared."

Boom!

The Dragon Claw swung. Simultaneously, the investigators guarding the entrance to the True Demon Realm rushed at me, spitting blood.

'This guy is a poison user.'

I smiled faintly as I saw the investigator charging at me, trying to inject poison into me.

Boom!

Our fists collided, and I deliberately showed a gap, allowing his poison to flow into my body. However, even though the poison weakened my strength, I could still handle two of them.

I quickly pushed the two back, bursting one of their bodies.

Boom!

He died instantly, and I grabbed his soul to prevent it from being resurrected through the soul passage.

Then, as I faced the poison user and was about to deliver the final blow.

"Ugh! Damn it...!"

I pretended to have a seizure from the poison inside my body and deliberately let go of their souls as if by mistake. Although I killed both bodies, I allowed their resurrection.

I shouted with a desperate expression.

"Damn it! No! If we lose the witnesses...!"

Whoosh!

The souls of the investigators flew away through the soul passage, and I stopped in place, grinning.

'With this, the Celestial Clan will be confused, right?'

Not all of the Celestial Clan are fools, and if I blatantly reveal Seo Hyul's face and say I'm planning something, they won't believe it unconditionally. They are more likely to think that someone is imitating Seo Hyul to frame him.

However, since I attempted to eliminate the witnesses to destroy the evidence, the Celestial Clan won't be able to ignore the possibility that this is the 'real' Seo Hyul.

'The Human Clan will strongly protest to the Mortal Clan about Seo Hyul and issue a bounty soon.'

Then, Gyuryeon will notice. She will realize that Seo Hyul is not completely dead. Since she knows Seo Hyul has some relationship with the Black Dragon King, if she hears that Seo Hyul mentioned the Black Dragon King today, she will likely hold onto hope.

'Considering Seo Hyul's cunning nature, there's a good chance he's not really dead, so it might not be a complete lie.'

Recalling the 15th cycle where Seo Hyul monitored everything about me through Won Yu, I felt a sudden chill.

The investigators of the True Demon Realm were dead, and the lower-level investigators guarding the entrance had all fled.

I swung the Dragon Claw comfortably, starting to destroy the entrance to the True Demon Realm, embedding as much of the power of the Dragon Clan and the Demon Clan as possible.

I didn't completely close it, but it was enough that the Human Clan in the True Demon Realm could open it by continuously knocking on the dimensional gate without worrying about the Celestial Clan.

The lords of the True Demon Realm wouldn't recklessly try to annihilate the Human Clan just because their retreat was blocked.

'Among the demons, the impression of the Human Clan is that they are a group of madmen...'

Having once sided with the demons, I knew how they viewed the Human Clan, so I could predict how the True Demon Realm would react.

'Rather than provoking them greatly, they will just seal it off and gradually tighten the encirclement.'

I grinned and turned back towards Cheonbulsan.

'I need to ask Hongbeom to detoxify me, stabilize the realm of the Cheonin-gi members even more...'

As I was thinking about my future plans.

Buzz!

My communication device rang, and Jeon Myeonghun contacted me.

"What is it, Jeon Myeonghun?"

—While searching through the remnants of the Golden God Thunder Gate, I found something.

"What is it?"

—It's a record written by the former Grand Elder after fighting with the Golden Guard.

'A record after Geum Byeokho fought with Yeonwi?'

"What about that record?"

—In the record... the former Grand Elder mentioned that after the Golden Guard was defeated, he confessed about the 'true orthodox foundation,' and the former Grand Elder sent some disciples to the Netherworld to find out more.

Hearing Jeon Myeonghun's words, I couldn't help but be surprised.

—And I found out that the former Grand Elder created a communication artifact to communicate with the disciples he sent to the Netherworld. And... according to the artifact, a signal was received just three days ago!

"That means...!"

—Some of the disciples who went to the Netherworld and were thought to be lost... they are still alive!

He shouted with a voice full of joy.

There weren't many disciples sent to the Netherworld. At most, four or five. But to Jeon Myeonghun, those disciples seemed to hold more value than just their numbers.

'He's overreacting for just four or five disciples.'

I was more interested in the information about the true orthodox foundation they discovered than the disciples themselves.

'With that, I can get closer to Seo Hyul's secret and surpass him...!'

Moreover, the true orthodox foundation is much stronger than the general orthodox or unorthodox foundations, so my power would increase dramatically.

'Hmm, wait... something feels off.'

As I was thinking that, I felt a sense of incongruity.

* * *

"Hmm..."

'I' applied for a mission to support the Black Scale Ghost Sect and entered the eastern region, frowning.

'What's this, the main body feels a bit strange.'

In earthly terms, it felt like I had become a bit of a psychopath. The way I wore Seo Hyul's face without hesitation, the attitude of trying to control Gyuryeon's actions from afar, and the strange lack of empathy for Jeon Myeonghun's words.

It felt like something was suddenly missing.

'Did that snake Seo Hyul do something?'

Whenever something happens, it's always Seo Hyul or Jinseon to suspect first.

'It's a strange feeling.'

Currently, my main body and I share thoughts. So if 'I' feel something is wrong, the main body knows it too. But when I turn my consciousness to the main body, strangely, nothing feels wrong.

'Rather, the main body thinks that worrying too much with Seo Lip's body is unnecessary.'

I recalled the time when Seo Hyul tried to brainwash me as soon as we met.

'Maybe the brainwashing I noticed was just a distraction, and the 'real' brainwashing was successful without me knowing?'

However, when I turn my consciousness to the main body, it dismisses it as an overly speculative thought.

'...It's unsettling.'

I thought about training the Ghost King Demon Art, gathering merit in the Ghost Bone Valley, and obtaining the ritual techniques of the Ghost Bone Valley. Maybe by mastering the ritual techniques, I could determine if something was wrong with the main body or if I was just being paranoid.

"Hoo..."

How many times did I exhale and inhale again? I gradually felt a black aura enveloping my body.

After a while, the black aura gathered around me, forming six swords.

The training method of the Ghost King Demon Art is as follows.

First, accumulate yin energy, then indirectly control ghost energy through the yin energy to create swords made of ghost energy.

Thud, thud, thud!

The swords began to pierce my entire body.

Second, insert the swords made of ghost energy into various spiritual veins in the body, severing them one by one. At this time, the severed spiritual veins are not regenerated on purpose.

Third, as the spiritual veins gradually sever, the body enters a state close to death, and in that near-death state, one perceives 'death.'

Fourth, repeat the process until one becomes accustomed to perceiving 'death,' and once successful, use incantations to gather 'power' in the near-death state.

Fifth, after gathering a certain amount of 'power,' use that 'power' to extract the 'power' from the souls of other spirits and train the technique...

'The fifth step is unnecessary.'

The 'power' referred to in the Ghost King Demon Art is 'death.' And I didn't need to extract death from other spirits; I could just draw it from the main body.

Buzz!

Thud, thud, thud, thud!

I severed the flow of life force while the ghost swords were embedded in Won Yu's body. And I immersed myself in the familiar feeling.

An endlessly familiar death. The darkness felt so natural in my hands.

'What is this?'

How many people consciously breathe while breathing? Probably not many. Most people only feel the presence of breath when they inhale fresh air in a very clear area or pant after intense exercise.

Breathing is that natural.

And I realized that, like breathing, I was naturally enveloped in 'death.'

I put my body in a state of suspended animation, submerged my consciousness, and separated the death enveloping my soul through incantations, merging it with Won Young.

'Is this... the end?'

I felt puzzled by the overly simple process.

"What? Wasn't this supposed to be extremely difficult?"

I asked Bi Yul, feeling confused.

Bi Yul, who described becoming a purple lust monster eunuch as a 'very minor side effect,' had described the Ghost King Demon Art as having a 'slightly difficult side effect.'

Naturally, the Ghost King Demon Art shouldn't be just 'slightly' difficult.

'Maybe the later stages of the Ghost King Demon Art become extremely difficult?'

I checked the later stages of the Ghost King Demon Art. I looked for something more difficult, but there was nothing particularly challenging. All the training methods were as ordinary and peaceful as breathing.

'Is there a hidden technique I don't know about?'

"Bi Yul, is there a hidden technique that appears after mastering the Ghost King Demon Art?"

"Wasn't it supposed to be extremely difficult? But the training methods are all ordinary, so I'm asking."

Bi Yul asked back, seemingly puzzled.

[Most disciples go mad from the pain when they start training the Ghost King Demon Art. So, mental training must be done simultaneously.]

"Hmm..."

'Is that supposed to be extremely difficult? In the Great Heaven Sect, we do that every day...'

Although there was a subtle difference in perspective between the main body and me, this time, even the main body couldn't understand and clicked its tongue.

'Pathetically weak.'

Bi Yul continued his explanation.

"Hmm..."

I frowned, not understanding his words.

"Isn't the fourth stage about handling the power of death and merging it with Won Young to transform into a Ghost King?"

"Is that supposed to be difficult?"

"..."

I was baffled because I didn't realize that the stage I passed as naturally as breathing was supposed to be difficult.

'What is this, is this right?'

It felt like moving something that had always been by my side.

'Rather, it felt refreshing, but others find this difficult?'

I couldn't believe that I had already passed the difficult stage of the Ghost King Demon Art so easily.

'Is this also Seo Hyul's trick?'

It seemed more plausible that Seo Hyul had done something without my knowledge than that I, with my mediocre talent, had quickly mastered the technique.

Feeling confused for a while, I moved death according to the Ghost King Demon Art's instructions, transforming Won Young.

Sizzle―

Won Young began to turn pitch black, his eyes narrowing, and his entire body was enveloped in black smoke and ghost energy.

After a while, I realized that the Won Young inside my dantian had transformed into a small Ghost King and opened my eyes.

"Hey, Bi Yul."

"Is this... mastering the Ghost King Demon Art?"

"..."

'How long has it been since I received the Ghost King Demon Art?'

Even if I added up all the time I spent receiving the Ghost King Demon Art, taking on a mission at the office, and returning to the east to start training, it was only one shichen.

'Mastering a technique I received for the first time in one shichen? Me?'

Of course, the time spent training was short, and I felt that my power was still lacking and needed to be filled. But I could tell.

I had grasped the essence of the Ghost King Demon Art, and if I continued to train, I would be able to accumulate power at an incredible speed.

* * *

About one yidang after realizing I had mastered the Ghost King Demon Art.

I received a notification that my application for a mission to support the Black Scale Ghost Sect had been accepted, and I was informed to gather at the mission site.

Soon after, I boarded the teleportation array heading to the Black Scale Ghost Sect outside the Black Bone Valley.

Whoosh!

When I opened my eyes, I saw a massive black palace resembling a dragon, as large as a mountain range.

The palace was built to look like a writhing dragon, and the main gate had the words "Black Scale Ghost Sect" written on it.

Outside the main gate, hundreds of investigators had already gathered, all exuding an aura of curses.

"Hmm? What's this?"

I looked to one side at Bi Yul's words. There, I saw people emitting a unique aura mixed with ghost energy and corpse energy.

"But can those 'remnants' walk around so openly?"

I looked at them with shining eyes.

"Those guys are practicing the Yin Soul Ghost Art."

Bi Yul confessed.

"I see... I think I understand."

I also knew from frequently using Won Yu as a cursed doll. The 'undying and regenerating' cursed doll boasted tremendous utility no matter how many times it was used.

They seemed to be creating zombies and using them as cursed dolls in a similar way to me.

"By the way, Bi Yul. Do you know anything about the Black Scale Ghost Sect? For example... why they suddenly need curse techniques..."

"Just?"

[It's a task commissioned by the Mortal Clan to the Black Scale Ghost Sect.]

"The Mortal Clan..."

I pondered why the Black Scale Ghost Sect would gather curse practitioners.

* * *

A dark secret room.

Inside the secret room, a water mirror made of black water floated.

Two figures sat cross-legged in front of the water mirror.

Buzz―

One figure touched the water mirror, muttering something.

After a while, the water mirror shook, and a man in black clothes appeared on the water mirror.

"Yes. I understand. Since poison users are mainly on our Mortal Clan's side..."

The figure touching the water mirror nodded.

"Since we couldn't secure a poison user, we must at least secure curse practitioners."

"Here it is."

The figure took out a piece of paper from his bosom and threw it into the water mirror.

The paper depicted a man in white clothes.

"The new governor of the Human Clan... Use as many curse practitioners as possible to curse him."

Her eyes narrowed vertically.

"I will also secure excellent poison users and prepare extreme poison..."

Gritting her teeth, she glared at the figure on the paper.

Seo Eunhyun.

'Based on the information, Seo Eunhyun is someone I can never defeat with my power alone.'

But there were countless ways for the weak to face the strong, and the most famous among them were curses and poison.

'In terms of poison, no one can match the Insect Clan, so I should contact them too. Use curse practitioners to curse him, hire poison users to create extreme poison, and lure him into a trap. If that happens... I will have a chance for revenge!'

Gyuryeon cut off contact with the Black Scale Ghost Sect and left the dark secret room, muttering with a venomous face.

"Wait, you bastard... I will definitely repay this grudge! No matter what it takes!"
