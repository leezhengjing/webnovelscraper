320 years have passed. There are 100 years left until the opening of the Zhulong Zhenren's Twilight Path. I have finally reached the Four Pillars Stage.

Rumble! A dark aura enveloped me. Boom, boom! Black clouds began to gather in the sky, with golden heavenly tribulations swirling within.

Based on the Heavenly Circle (Tianyuan), the foundation of the Earthly Square (Difang) is formed. The Four Realms (Sijie) flow through the Heavenly Circle formed during the Celestial Human Stage (Tianrenji). And the Five Peaks (Wuyue) created during the Primordial Spirit Stage (Yuanyingji). The attribute of one's main cultivation method is placed in the center of the Five Peaks, with the remaining four attributes arranged in the four directions. These mountains are then used as pillars connecting heaven and earth. The four pillars connect with the Four Realms in the sky, drawing down the power of the heavens.

Buzz! The halo of the Heavenly Circle, which floated behind the upper dantian of my Primordial Spirit, descended into the lower dantian, forming a similar round shape. By embedding four axes into this circle, it is transformed into a square, completing the Earthly Square. This is the cultivation of the Four Pillars Stage.

Boom! As I began to form the foundation of the Earthly Square, golden lightnings roared from the sky. The heavenly tribulations faced when advancing from the late Celestial Human Stage to the Great Perfection were 20 bolts. And the tribulations faced when advancing from the Celestial Human Stage to the Four Pillars Stage were generally known to be 25 bolts.

Crash! A golden waterfall of light poured down from the sky. However, I raised my head towards the heavens. Rumble! The dark aura covered my body. Using the Ghost King Transformation created by the Ghost King Demon Art would make me just an ordinary Ghost King. But the Ghost King Transformation created by the Great Desert Sea Star was different. It was a method that maximized the use of the death power covering my soul. That was the Great Desert Sea Star.

Crack, crack! Around my head, skulls formed from the dark aura began to emerge. My body gradually transformed into a ghostly form, with ghost chains on my hands and prayer beads on my feet. My original face also began to wither and transform into a skull. An 18-headed Ghost King. That was me.

The wailing of ghosts echoed everywhere. Dark energy surged from all directions, and the ghosts in the Black Ghost Valley began to scream. Buzz! The framework of the Earthly Square formed within my body continuously circulated my energy, converting it into vitality. My senses became sharper and clearer, and my understanding of 'life' was grasped in my hand. The circulation of the heaven and earth energy became more apparent, and my consciousness expanded and became clearer.

Crash! A golden waterfall covered me. But I did not panic and opened my 18 mouths. Ooooo— The 18 heads began to sing. It was a song of death. The dark energy surged, weakening the heavenly tribulations. At the same time, black lightning began to shoot out from the dark energy. It was the Six Extreme Yin Thunder God.

Crackle! Beneath my feet, black lightning gathered, forming the shapes of six ghosts like shadows. These were not actual ghosts but symbols of curses representing the Six Extremes: sudden death, disease, sorrow, poverty, evil, and weakness. Among them, the ghost symbolizing sudden death had a particularly larger head than the others. The ghosts began to hold hands and circle around me, generating dark lightning to counter the heavenly tribulations.

And finally. Whirring— Above my head, the shape of a Taiji appeared, absorbing the weakened heavenly tribulations. It was the Taiji True Thunder God. Although I couldn't use it openly within the Black Ghost Valley, refining the heavenly tribulations into Taiji True Thunder while enduring them was something no one would notice.

An eternity seemed to pass, and finally. Crash! I overcame the last bolt of heavenly tribulation. Flash! Boom! Light burst from my body, madly absorbing the surrounding heaven and earth energy. It wasn't just because of the Great Desert Sea Star's incantation. My body, which was absorbing the heaven and earth energy, had already harmonized with the surrounding spiritual veins. This was a harmonization with the earth.

In the small realm, sacrifices were always made to the heavens. But from the Four Pillars Stage, the object of the sacrifice was no longer the heavens. It was the earth. The earth, meaning the realm of Qi. From this stage, the cultivation methods of the Celestial and Earthly Clans became almost indistinguishable, with only slight differences in approach. Of course, the Celestial Clan aimed to influence the realm of names by sacrificing to the realm of Qi, while the Earthly Clan aimed to achieve the realm of Qi itself. But the methods were almost identical.

The body harmonized with the earth absorbed the heaven and earth energy, simultaneously dyeing the surrounding heaven and earth. Rumble— The surrounding earth was dyed with dark energy. Ghosts wailed and rejoiced everywhere. The wailing of ghosts echoed through heaven and earth. The entire land became suitable for ghosts to live in. The cultivation of the Four Pillars Stage allowed one to either leave the transformed land as it was or restore it to its original state. Now, they had the basic authority to manipulate the natural world.

Rumble— I gathered my strength and reabsorbed the dark energy filling the heaven and earth into my body. Hoo— I stood up, shedding ghostly tears from my 36 eyes. From the Four Pillars Stage, the bodies of the Earthly Clan grew stronger and larger. However, for the Celestial Clan, their bodies began to transform according to the ideal form led by their cultivation method. In the Celestial Human Stage, they could temporarily transform their bodies, but it was almost like an illusion technique. But in the Four Pillars Stage, it was different. It was a true transformation of the original body. Of course, they could return to their original form, but the more they drew on the power of their cultivation method, the more they transformed into a different form.

Now, my original form was no longer human but the 18-headed Ghost King. After observing my form for a moment, I reverted to my human shape. I returned to my original appearance, wearing black robes, and reached out towards the void. Rumble— As I generated gravitational force from my hand, the space began to warp. From the Four Pillars Stage, the power of 'Heavenly Guidance' obtained in the Celestial Human Stage evolved into 'Gravitational Force.' Gravitational force came from the earth, so it was obtained from the Four Pillars Stage, which had gained enlightenment of the earth. This gravitational force grew stronger and larger with each stage, allowing one to perform techniques like the Shrinking Earth Technique in the Four Pillars Stage. However, in the Fusion Stage, it became possible to warp and distort space to create subspaces without interfering with the realm. In the Star Shattering Stage, it allowed one to warp vast spacetime to leap across distances equivalent to several light-years. In the Star Reversal Stage, it allowed one to twist the orbits of stars in the star realm and control the flow of the middle realm. And from the Opening Stage, it was said that gravitational force ascended to the realm of names, allowing one to twist spacetime and slightly interfere with fate.

Rumble— I generated gravitational force by grasping the void. At this point, I couldn't use such strong gravitational force. Even the Shrinking Earth Technique was only possible from the mid-Four Pillars Stage for those with exceptional talent or unique cultivation methods. The benefit of gravitational force in the early Four Pillars Stage was one thing. Rumble! As I generated gravitational force in the realm of Qi, an immense amount of heaven and earth energy began to pour into me. From the Four Pillars Stage, the unit of heaven and earth energy that could be manipulated through gravitational force changed. In the Celestial Human Stage, the boundary between the internal and external was blurred, allowing one to manipulate external heaven and earth energy. At most, it was heavenly guidance. But from the Four Pillars Stage, it became possible to gather and manipulate overwhelmingly more heaven and earth energy than in the Celestial Human Stage using gravitational force.

Rumble— Vitality surged through my entire body. I read the celestial energy that extended my lifespan to 10,000 years and took a deep breath. 'Finally, I have reached the Four Pillars Stage.' Combining the Celestial Clan's cultivation method and the Ghost King's circuit, I had the power of the late Four Pillars Stage. 'I have become too weak because I can no longer use the Formless Sword.' At some point, I could no longer reflect my mental image into my energy. It was probably because I was completely separated from my main body. 'Or maybe….' It could also be because Seohul had taken over the main body. If Seohul, who didn't understand the mind and knew nothing about martial arts, couldn't properly handle the Formless Sword, there was a high possibility that it would be lost. Although I was disconnected from the main body, I shared the fundamental foundation, so if there was an anomaly in the main body's mental image, I couldn't use the Formless Sword. If I wanted to use the Formless Sword again, there was only one way. 'If I completely sever the connection with Seoeunhyun and completely reincarnate as the personality of Seorip….' If that happened, I would be able to use the Formless Sword again. 'But that would be meaningless.' I am Seorip. But at the same time, I am Seoeunhyun. There was no need to go out of my way to become an independent 'me' by breaking away from the frame of Seoeunhyun. "...Well, it doesn't matter much." Anyway, if I obtain useful things from the Zhulong Zhenren's Twilight Path, the gap in power will be filled. Moreover, Seohul still needed 600 years to escape the barrier, so there was more time. 'It feels like the speed at which I learn cultivation methods and raise my realm is accelerating.' At this rate, I might be able to aim for the Fusion Stage in a few hundred years. I suddenly thought that if I hadn't wasted time and focused solely on demonic cultivation from the beginning, I might have reached the Star Shattering Stage by now. 'Not that demonic cultivation is good….' Setting aside the fact that my original form had become so grotesque, I still couldn't get rid of the hatred and anger towards Wonlip, and the rage and disgust towards demonic cultivation. Even the Great Desert Sea Star, which I had modified to not be demonic cultivation, sometimes made me shudder with disgust while training. Anyway, I knew the utility of demonic cultivation, so it wouldn't be bad to modify and learn it in the future, or to focus on those that didn't require sacrificing others.

While I was lost in thought. —Master, congratulations on reaching the realm. "Hongbeom?" I received a message from Hongbeom and took a step. On an unfamiliar mountain peak. Below the peak, the eerie wind blew, creating a chilling sound. This was Sapfeng Station. The Black Ghost Valley was working on creating a shortcut to rescue Gang Minhee, a genius with the Ghost Dao Yin Hua Root, who appeared once in 100,000 years. Naturally, I volunteered to help create the shortcut at Sapfeng Station to rescue Gang Minhee. And after absorbing the dark energy of Sapfeng Station and training diligently for hundreds of years, I reached the Four Pillars Stage. "I will go there now. Be prepared." —Yes, thank you. Rumble! I generated gravitational force and stomped my foot. Paang! I set a gravitational point at the target location and was pulled towards it. This allowed me to fly without using the Flying Technique. After flying for a while, I finally reached the place where Hongbeom was. Whirring— The rugged peaks of Sapfeng Station. There was a basin surrounded by those peaks in a circular shape. Hongbeom was sitting in the center of the basin, stroking his beard with his shriveled body, waiting. "Are you ready?" "Yes, Master." Hongbeom had reached the Great Perfection of the Celestial Human Stage from the Primordial Spirit Stage in 300 years and was ready to advance to the Four Pillars Stage. No matter how talented I was in demonic cultivation, I didn't think I had more talent than Hongbeom. "Then we can start soon." Boom! As I stomped my foot, the basin buzzed and turned into sand, becoming a desert. And from all directions, earthen totems appeared, opening their mouths towards the sky. The totems would act as lightning rods to disperse the heavenly tribulations. "Watch the celestial energy for me." "Now is the right time. The Two Stars, the Five Stars, and the Seven Stars have risen in the sky." "Thank you…. Then, I will begin!" Rumble! Hongbeom revealed his true form. A giant centipede exuding dark poison appeared before my eyes. By now, Hongbeom's true form had grown so large that each segment was as big as a three-story building. Hongbeom's true form alone could envelop the entire capital of the Yeonguk Kingdom. Sizzle— The surrounding land was instantly contaminated by his poison. Knowing that inhaling Hongbeom's poison would be dangerous, I stepped back. And his advancement began. Crash! Flash! The sky lit up, and golden heavenly tribulations poured down. This time, too, Hongbeom's heavenly tribulations were at an absurd level. Although they weren't simultaneously golden and indigo like those of the Bell Masters, the heavenly tribulations that struck Hongbeom were far larger than those of other cultivators of the same level. Boom! Hongbeom endured the heavenly tribulations within the pillar of light. Although the formation I had set up in advance slightly dispersed the heavenly tribulations, Hongbeom still seemed to be struggling. Crackle! As the heavenly tribulations reached their peak. I operated the Taiji True Thunder God and trapped some of Hongbeom's heavenly tribulations in the Taiji. Crash! The heavens seemed to be enraged, and more heaven and earth energy gathered. But I smiled and dropped a thread of the heavenly tribulations trapped in the Taiji onto Hongbeom. As soon as Hongbeom touched the thread of heavenly tribulations, the heavens stopped trying to strengthen the tribulations. It was a kind of trick. Completely helping with the tribulations was not allowed, but trapping them in the Taiji and then gradually releasing them was barely within the permissible range. Of course, even this had a set limit, and if that limit was exceeded or if more than one person did this, the tribulations would eventually grow. But even this much seemed to save Hongbeom, who took a moment to thank me. Sizzle— Hongbeom gathered his energy, exuding dark poison, and overcame the tribulations. And at some point. Flash! The tribulations ended, and Hongbeom finally harmonized with the earth. Rumble! The earth was filled with poison. After a while, Hongbeom, who had reabsorbed the poison, began to move. Clatter, clatter! Soon, his carapace fell off, and Hongbeom began to shed his skin. Sizzle— The shed Hongbeom transformed into a black centipede exuding even darker poison. After savoring the poison for a while, Hongbeom reverted to his human form. I slowly approached Hongbeom, who was inhaling and exhaling poison. "Are you alright, Hongbeom?" After being in the poison for a while, Hongbeom reabsorbed it. Soon, his figure, shrouded in a poison cloud, was revealed. "Hmm…!" I was slightly surprised by Hongbeom's appearance. "Hongbeom, your appearance…." Hongbeom had become younger. He hadn't become a young man from an old man. But his hair, which had been completely white, now had a slight black tint, and his wrinkled skin had improved a bit. Moreover, his completely hunched back had straightened a bit, making him taller. 'I felt it a little when he advanced from the Primordial Spirit Stage to the Celestial Human Stage….' At that time, his wrinkled appearance had improved a bit, making him look a bit more lively. But now, he looked completely rejuvenated, as if he had gone from a 100-year-old to a 90-year-old when advancing from the Primordial Spirit Stage to the Celestial Human Stage. And now, he looked like he had gone from a 90-year-old to an 80-year-old. 'Does he get younger with each advancement….' It reminded me of the phrase 'Hongbeom's time goes backward.' Hongbeom took a deep breath and answered. "I'm fine. I feel very refreshed. Now that I've reached the Four Pillars Stage, my perception has expanded, and I feel like I can create even more and varied poisons." "Hmm, that's good to hear." I felt very reassured looking at Hongbeom. The poisons Hongbeom created were effective even against the Fusion Stage. So, even if I had to fight the main body, I wasn't afraid. 'Hongbeom has also reached the Four Pillars Stage.' Now, the only thing left was to stabilize the shortcut quickly. 'I heard that Hwagak and Horyeong are working on stabilizing the shortcut quickly….' Soon, I would be able to contact Gang Minhee again. A few days passed after reaching the Four Pillars Stage. Finally, I received a message from Hwagak and Horyeong. Crackle! The newly established base of the Black Ghost Valley at Sapfeng Station. The command post of the Black Ghost Valley's Sapfeng Station branch. In my eastern room there, Hwagak's projection appeared. Crackle— A ghostly figure formed from dark energy took the shape of Hwagak and appeared before me. Hwagak looked at my realm and clicked his tongue in amazement. I greeted him politely. "It's nothing. It's only natural given that the sect's Daoist might be in danger. But more importantly, you contacted me because…." "Yes." After exchanging a few words, we immediately entered the command post. Inside the command post. The office of the Ghost Soul Pavilion's pavilion master. We stood in front of the blueprint leading to the shortcut drawn by the Ghost Soul Pavilion master. "Understood." I formed a hand seal and operated the dark energy. My appearance instantly transformed back into the 18-headed Ghost King. As I performed the Ghost King Transformation, the shortcut became even clearer. The blueprint drawn inside the command post was just for fixing the coordinates. The 'real' blueprint was drawn on the outskirts of the underworld, visible through the Ghost Soul Pavilion. As I formed a hand seal towards the blueprint drawn with the power of death, the blueprints moved, forming a door. I naturally reached out towards the door. The structure of the door, the manpower involved in creating it, and how to create the door all came to mind. 'Now that I've reached the Four Pillars Stage… the structure of the shortcut isn't difficult.' Knowing how to manipulate gravitational force and
