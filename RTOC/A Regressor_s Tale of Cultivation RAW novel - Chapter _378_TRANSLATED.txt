**Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 378: At Sea (6)**

**Boom!**

A corner of the Yan Bone Ship. The area where alcohol was stored. A loud explosion echoed from there. The space was compressed, creating a storage area the size of a small city, filled with an absurd amount of alcohol. From lower realm liquors like rice wine and moonshine to high-quality middle realm liquors like Spirit Essence Elixir, White Rainbow Wine, and True Moon Island Wine, the massive explosion shattered their containers, causing the alcohol to flow throughout the storage area.

Bai Lin was there, holding Liu Yao with one arm, panting heavily.

**Boom!**

Several members of the Ghost Clan, including Jin Maye, fell in front of them. Jin Maye laughed, his muscles bulging with excitement.

**Buzz!**

Jin Maye's five horns vibrated in unison.

"This... fighting you while you're holding Liu Yao makes it feel like I'm fighting her. I have no interest in a weakling like Liu Yao, but focusing on her face during the battle makes it feel like I'm doing what I wanted with her, which is very enjoyable."

His face was flushed red. Bai Lin roared in anger.

"Filthy scum! Don't look at her like that!"

"Who's filthy? Liu Yao is my betrothed, designated by the Lord of the True Dragon Palace. You're the one who kidnapped my betrothed and is running away."

"Who would abuse their betrothed like that? Stop spouting nonsense!"

"It's a tradition of our Ghost Clan. If Liu Yao doesn't want to be abused by me, she should grow stronger and enjoy fighting with me."

"Stop talking nonsense! Do you think I don't know about the Ghost Clan's customs? The Ghost Clan always takes a partner of the same realm as their betrothed and fights in the same realm. What you're doing is just abusing the weak!"

"Is there a problem with disciplining a thief who stole from me?"

Jin Maye smirked and extended his palm towards Bai Lin and Liu Yao.

**Boom!**

A giant palm shot towards Bai Lin, who quickly dodged. The massive wine barrel behind Bai Lin shattered, and the alcohol inside flowed out, turning the area into a sea of alcohol.

**Crack!**

The sea of alcohol froze under Bai Lin's yin energy and ghost energy, and ice spikes formed from the alcohol. Jin Maye, using only his physical strength, shattered the ice spikes and charged at Bai Lin.

"Come on, bonehead. Stop talking nonsense and entertain me more. Make me happier!"

"Grr...!"

Jin Maye, with an excited expression, gathered energy in the air to form a chain sickle and swung it at Bai Lin.

**Crash!**

The ice ground created by Bai Lin shattered in an instant.

**Clatter!**

The chain sickle, writhing like a living creature, continued to chase Bai Lin. Finally, the chain sickle struck towards Bai Lin. Liu Yao closed her eyes tightly, and Bai Lin shouted, exuding ghost energy.

"White Bone Escape Technique, First Form!"

**Boom!**

The chain sickle seemed to pierce through Bai Lin's body, but Bai Lin split into hundreds and thousands of afterimages, all fleeing in different directions. Each afterimage was holding Liu Yao, making it impossible to tell which was the real one. However, Jin Maye licked his lips in excitement.

"Good...! Very good...! If a worm-like creature can't fight, it should at least have the skill to run away to make it worth catching!"

Jin Maye, with an excited expression, bulged his muscles and swung the chain sickle in all directions.

**Boom!**

It was like a storm of chain sickles. Soon, two-thirds of Bai Lin's afterimages were destroyed. The remaining third were also quickly being hunted down by Jin Maye.

"Stop right there, struggle more! Hahaha! Make me happier!"

Bai Lin and Liu Yao's real bodies left the alcohol storage without looking back, spurred by the chilling voice behind them. Liu Yao clung to Bai Lin's chest, shaking.

"...It's enough now. Leave me and run away. You can escape on your own."

But Bai Lin, with burning ghost energy in his eyes, spoke firmly.

"No!"

"Why not? Didn't you become a ghost creature because you didn't want to die? Jin Maye is a combined realm Grandmaster! If he gets excited, he'll come after you even if you're a ghost creature!"

But Bai Lin shook his head with a determined face.

"The Sect Leader ordered me to take care of you. So, I won't leave you behind and run away."

"That's crazy! If you die, it's over! Let go of me! Leave me!"

Liu Yao tried to push Bai Lin away and escape from his arms, but Bai Lin held her tighter.

"...In the past, I ran away, leaving my friends behind."

Bai Lin recalled the events in the Ghost Realm. The betrayal of Wei Shihun and the capture of Yin Wa by the Wuji Sect. Now, he was loyal to the Wuji Sect, but back then, it felt like the sky was falling.

"And... I had to pay the price for that."

The event that broke Bai Lin's heart happened afterward.

'I liked Yin Wa first...'

But Bai Lin ran away, leaving Yin Wa behind. As a result, Yin Wa married Wei Shihun. Bai Lin had to watch his beloved be taken by his best friend. That was the price of running away.

"I will never run away again!"

Bai Lin, holding Liu Yao, ran out of the alcohol storage and headed to the food storage. The food storage was smaller than the alcohol storage, about the size of a small village. However, it was filled with the corpses of giant beasts and all kinds of food. Bai Lin hid behind the bones of a giant beast with Liu Yao. When Bai Lin formed a hand seal, the bones of the beast moved, cleverly hiding them.

"Don't worry. My White Bone Escape Technique once evaded even the Six Ghost King of our sect. They won't find us easily."

He spoke while panting, and Liu Yao looked at him for a moment before smiling.

"...Shall I tell you a secret of my clan?"

"Suddenly...?"

"Our clan has a distant ancestor from the Sea Dragon Clan. So, we have some Sea Dragon blood in us. Although we are a mix of carp and sea dragon... Anyway, my father, who was born a carp, succeeded in transforming into a dragon and became a member of the Dragon Clan."

"What does that have to do with the current situation?"

"It's important. The Black Dragon Clan has the authority to control all yin elements in the world, and the Sea Dragon Clan, as a branch of the Black Dragon Clan, has the authority to control all seas in the world."

She continued.

"The Sea Dragon Clan is far inferior to the Black Dragon Clan in handling yin energy, but they are more specialized in controlling the 'sea.' And the sea that the Sea Dragon Clan can control is not just limited to saltwater."

Liu Yao's eyes sparkled.

"They can also control the seas of the High Realm to some extent. In fact, the Sea Dragon Clan is the only race that can ascend to the surface from the seas of the High Realm without a high stone. They find the 'path' of the sea!"

She began to unbutton her top. Revealing her chest, Liu Yao pointed to her heart.

"Take my heart. The Sea Dragon blood I have is very inferior and insignificant, so my father treated me like trash. That's why I survived... Last time, I received the energy of Lord Seoran and awakened more of my Sea Dragon blood. Take my heart, the source of my Sea Dragon energy, and swim to the surface from the seas of the High Realm."

Bai Lin looked at Liu Yao's face for a moment before speaking.

"Why are you doing this for me...?"

Liu Yao's voice trembled as she spoke.

"Because, despite all my lies and attempts to escape, you were the only one who treated me consistently."

Bai Lin was silent for a moment, then adjusted Liu Yao's clothes.

"No need. I..."

At that moment.

**Boom!**

The door of the food storage was smashed open, and Jin Maye walked in with a sinister smile.

"I've caught all the escaping afterimages. I know you're in there. Come out."

Bai Lin flinched. He could tell. Jin Maye's consciousness was precisely pinpointing where Bai Lin and Liu Yao were hiding. Bai Lin stepped out with Liu Yao in front of Jin Maye.

"How did you find all those afterimages so quickly...!"

Jin Maye chuckled.

"I'm a hunter. I'm skilled in tracking, hiding, and hunting. My pirate crew, who learned these skills from me, are the same... And actually, I knew your location from the beginning."

He pointed to Liu Yao's chest.

"That liar has tried to escape and deceive me many times. I placed a tracking spell on that carp's heart. Unless she has the courage to rip out her own heart, you were always in my grasp."

Liu Yao shrank back at his words. Bai Lin glanced at Liu Yao. Jin Maye, seeing Liu Yao's reaction, seemed to realize something and exclaimed.

"Ah! I think I know what that liar told you. Did she say something like, 'If you take my heart, you can escape,' or something along those lines?"

"..."

Bai Lin was silent, and Liu Yao shrank back even more. Jin Maye laughed, reading Liu Yao's thoughts.

"So it's true. Last time, I placed a spell on her leg, and she escaped by giving her lower body to one of my subordinates. Since she's above the Origin Realm, losing a major part of her body doesn't kill her, so it's not a problem. Haha, what do you think? Do you still want to protect her? I'll give you one last chance. Hand over Liu Yao and get lost. You're out of energy, so you don't excite me anymore. I'll let you go."

Liu Yao bit her lip. However, Bai Lin did not move. Instead, he stood in front of Liu Yao, his circuits glowing with the technique he received from Kim Yeon, burning with fighting spirit.

"...What? I told you she deceived you."

But Bai Lin only burned with ghost energy.

"It doesn't matter. I never cared, and I never intended to run away!"

"Ho... such spirit."

Bai Lin did not back down and stood in front of Liu Yao, who looked at him with a complicated expression.

"Good...! I like such people too! Now, serve me more!"

Jin Maye, excited by Bai Lin's unyielding stance, began to approach them. At that moment.

**Rumble!**

The ship shook violently, and the heavenly energy changed. Liu Yao's eyes sparkled as she read the heavenly energy, and Jin Maye frowned.

"Damn...!"

"Bai Lin! The Yan Bone Ship has surfaced!"

As soon as Liu Yao's words were heard, Bai Lin cast a spell towards the wall, creating a hole in an instant. What appeared was not the dark abyss of the deep sea but a clear surface.

**Flash!**

Bai Lin, holding Liu Yao, used his escape technique to quickly get out. Jin Maye, with an enraged expression, followed the two ghost creatures and reached out his hand.

**Rumble!**

The gravitational force of the combined realm Grandmaster's hand began to pull Bai Lin and Liu Yao. Bai Lin, exhausted, started to be pulled towards Jin Maye. He gritted his teeth.

'Damn... is this the end?'

Liu Yao's betrayal didn't matter. It was something he could deal with, having been betrayed by a closer friend and having his first love taken by that friend. Bai Lin felt the ghost energy in his eyes fading as he exhaled.

'Still... the Conquering King and the Strange Ghost King should be able to escape. With this, my mission is complete...'

And then.

**Boom!**

A beam of light from somewhere struck Jin Maye's arm. Bai Lin, with his mouth agape, looked in disbelief at the source of the beam.

"Your Highness!! Why didn't you escape!?"

It was Kim Yeon and Buk Hyanghwa. 

**Flash!**

Riding a puppet, the two puppet masters, each sticking their heads out from the puppet's head, swiftly flew towards Bai Lin and Liu Yao, who were being pulled by Jin Maye, and grabbed them.

"Don't worry, there's good news!"

Kim Yeon smiled brightly as she flew quickly, and Buk Hyanghwa also smiled reassuringly, agreeing with Kim Yeon's words. Behind them, the enraged combined realm Grandmaster, Jin Maye, began to chase after them.

**Clatter!**

With a single swing of his chain sickle, the puppet was cut in half. However, Buk Hyanghwa manipulated something, and the four people inside the puppet were ejected forward. Buk Hyanghwa shouted towards the puppet.

"General Buk, self-destruct!"

**Boom!**

The puppet, which had ejected them, self-destructed, creating a cloud of mist. But Jin Maye pushed through the mist and swung his chain sickle at them from behind. Kim Yeon gathered heavenly energy, and Bai Lin used repulsion force. However, Jin Maye's chain sickle ignored all their defenses and sliced through Kim Yeon's right arm, Buk Hyanghwa's upper body, and Bai Lin's skull.

"Ugh!"

Buk Hyanghwa spat blood, and Kim Yeon quickly regenerated her arm, shrinking her consciousness domain. The consciousness domain, gathered in the form of a fingernail on Kim Yeon's left arm, momentarily turned pink and then shot out as a massive slash towards Jin Maye.

**Boom!**

It was Kim Yeon's martial art, which had occasionally destroyed the Wuji Sect and unleashed tremendous power. Jin Maye seemed to ignore it and charge forward, but his expression changed drastically, and he deployed his domain to defend against Kim Yeon's strike. Taking advantage of the gap, Kim Yeon quickly used her escape technique, holding the others.

"Bai Lin, are you okay?"

"Yes, I'm fine since I'm a ghost creature!"

"Buk Hyanghwa, are you okay?"

But Buk Hyanghwa did not respond. Kim Yeon immediately knew the reason.

'Her origin energy is damaged!'

"Buk Hyanghwa, Buk Hyanghwa! Wake up! Stay with me!"

Kim Yeon's voice trembled. She quickly used her consciousness threads to seal the wound and prevent the origin energy from dispersing, but Buk Hyanghwa, with a faint breath, only looked up at Kim Yeon with blurry eyes.

"Buk Hyanghwa!!! Hyanghwa, wake up! I won't call you Yingying anymore! So, please... don't die! Please!"

**Boom!**

And, Jin Maye, who had shaken off Kim Yeon's strike, was chasing them from behind. Licking his lips, he followed Kim Yeon with a chain sickle and a ghost sword in his hands. Jin Maye, who had caught up with Kim Yeon in an instant, raised his ghost sword. The next moment, Jin Maye was split in half.

**Boom!**

Kim Yeon, who was preparing another strike while looking back, collided with something huge while flying.

"Ah..."

Tears welled up in Kim Yeon's eyes.

"U, Eunhyeon... Buk Hyanghwa is... now..."

The Ghost King with 19 heads gestured to the giant centipede behind him. The giant centipede quickly brought a floating device, laid down Bai Lin, Kim Yeon, and Buk Hyanghwa, and began treating them.

* * *

I looked coldly at Jin Maye, who was reattaching his split body in front of me. He licked his lips with an excited expression.

**Buzz!**

The horn on his forehead vibrated unpleasantly.

"This...! Excellent. Wuji Sect Leader, will you also entertain me? Let's compete! It's a pity you're in the form of a ghost creature, but with a strong opponent like you, it doesn't matter! Let's mix our bodies and dance together! Hahaha! The thrilling excitement I couldn't feel even with the Six Ghost King...! Come on, attack me!"

I looked at him for a moment, then wrapped my hands in curses and blessings.

"What! Wait! Damn it, you coward! Don't fight like that, let's clash body to body..."

A blinding white light covered the world.
