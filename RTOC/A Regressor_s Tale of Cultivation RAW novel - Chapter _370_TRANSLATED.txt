Holding Hands (6)

Rumble! I entered the Black Sea, heading towards the Black Road, the home of Seoran and Songjin at the center of the Black Sea. After a while, I could sense a familiar presence. Rumble! In the distance, a valley similar in shape to the Black Ghost Bone Valley came into view. It seemed that just as Songjin had changed the name of this sea, he had also transformed the original appearance of that island into the form of the Black Ghost Bone Valley.

‘But it lacks the eerie aura of the Black Ghost Bone Valley.’ Well, it wasn’t the Ghost Realm, and it wouldn’t be easy to find such an eerie aura in the Goryeo Realm. If Seoran, who had mastered the Ghost Dao techniques, had reached the level of controlling the dragon veins, it might have been different, but Seoran’s level was lower than Shihu’s, so it was meaningless.

Rumble! After a while, when the Guangyin Territory arrived at the Black Road, a powerful suction force emerged from the Black Road, starting to absorb the ghostly energy of the Guangyin Territory. And from within the Black Road, which had absorbed the ghostly energy of the Guangyin Territory, a formation made of ghostly energy seemed to emerge, amplifying the ghostly energy.

Rumble! Soon, the Black Road, true to its name, became a sinister island with a perfect training environment for ghostly creatures. Seoran hurriedly came out of his room, wiping sweat from his excited face, and looked down at the Black Road.

“We’ve arrived at the Black Road!”

“Yes. But that formation on the Black Road….”

“Oh, that’s one of the formations my master set up from the Black Ghost Bone Valley. Originally, it was meant to amplify the ghostly energy within the island to aid my training and make my master’s physical body more comfortable….”

He had a rather cheerful expression.

“With this level of ghostly energy…!”

Suddenly, I felt a massive vortex of ghostly energy forming at the center of the Black Road.

“That ghostly energy….”

It was a familiar wave of ghostly energy. After a while, a familiar ghostly creature emerged from the vortex of ghostly energy. It was Songjin. He inhaled the ghostly energy comfortably, looked at Seoran, and then shuddered slightly when he saw me standing next to him. However, he sighed and spoke.

“…I’ve heard everything from Seoran, senior. Please come in.”

“Haha, senior? Just call me comfortably.”

“…You jest too much. Someone of your level must have lived for thousands of years. It was rather rude of me not to recognize you in the Water Realm.”

Having heard about me from Seoran since the Weizheng Sea, Songjin seemed to think I was some old monster who had hidden his cultivation, and he bowed politely.

‘Well… if he insists on thinking that way, there’s nothing I can do.’

Since he firmly believed it, no matter what I said, it wouldn’t change anything.

“…Alright. If you wish to treat me that way, do as you please. By the way… is this Black Road a branch of the Black Ghost Bone Palace?”

“Yes, senior. However, due to the nature of the Goryeo Realm, we haven’t received official permission yet as we can’t contact the main sect.”

“I see. So, does it have the floating maintenance function like the main sect or the Guanghan Realm branch, or the Water Realm’s Black Ghost Bone Valley?”

The Black Ghost Bone Valley had a function to maintain the ship even if it couldn’t dock at sea, allowing it to float in the air and be maintained through the formation of the Black Ghost Bone Valley itself.

“Yes, we have that function on our Black Road as well….”

“Good. I’d like you to support the Guangyin Territory on the Black Road for a while.”

“Uh….”

Songjin glanced at the Guangyin Territory and broke into a cold sweat.

“Uh… senior, with all due respect, that landmass is much larger than the ship, so I’m not sure if the function will work.”

“It’s fine. It will work.”

Rumble! I moved the Guangyin Territory above the Black Road and signaled to Songjin. Songjin groaned and formed a hand seal, causing the Guangyin Territory to float above the Black Road.

“Hongfan, deactivate the floating formation of the Guangyin Territory.”

I sent a voice transmission to Hongfan, and soon, Hongfan temporarily deactivated the floating formation.

Boom! The formation activated across the entire Black Road, lifting six translucent shadows towards the Guangyin Territory. As the shadows rose into the air, they became more distinct, transforming into giant translucent skeletal hands as they reached the Guangyin Territory. The six giant skeletal hands, shimmering translucently, supported the Guangyin Territory.

Rumble! Although the skeletal hands seemed to crack slightly under the weight of the Guangyin Territory, the landmass was a part of the Ghost Realm’s mainland, filled with pure ghostly energy. The skeletal hands, absorbing the ghostly energy of the Ghost Realm, became more distinct, repairing the cracks and properly supporting the Guangyin Territory.

Songjin watched for a moment and then cleared his throat.

“…Senior, originally, three of the hands were used to support the ship, and the other three were used for maintenance, but now they are all supporting your territory, so maintenance is impossible.”

“That’s fine. We can handle the maintenance of the Guangyin Territory ourselves.”

The reason I used the formation of the Black Road was that the Guangyin Territory had been floating for too long, and I needed to cool down the floating formation for a while.

“Now, come in. It’s been a while since I’ve seen you, so it’s good to see you.”

Although I hadn’t built a close relationship with Songjin, we weren’t on bad terms, so it felt alright. He hesitated for a moment but eventually entered the Guangyin Territory.

* * *

The reunion with Songjin after a long time was truly wonderful.

“That’s great news!”

Songjin, who was almost out of ghostly energy, was on the verge of being dragged to the Netherworld, but thanks to absorbing the pure ghostly energy of the Guangyin Territory, his lifespan had increased again.

“No, this won’t do. If you wish, I can give you a new body with the ‘surgery’ and ‘grace’ of our sect.”

I pointed to one of the servants in the meeting room of the Wujiao Sect and explained the grace of the Wujiao Sect. However, Songjin laughed heartily and shook his head.

“I appreciate the kindness, but my body is no longer needed outside the ship. I have a great disciple who has opened a branch of the Black Ghost Bone Valley in the Goryeo Realm, so I just want to go peacefully when the ship’s lifespan ends.”

“Hmm… I heard from the Conqueror King that the ship lasts a long time if you repair it and fill it with the ghostly energy of the Guangyin Territory.”

It was true. If the ship, which was destroyed by the Monster King, was repaired and filled with the ghostly energy of the Guangyin Territory, Songjin could live for a long time. However, Songjin laughed heartily and said.

“If it’s just about the ship, yes. But… the ship has a history. And that history ended in the war with the Monster King. The ship, where the disciples of the Black Ghost Bone Valley laughed and chatted, were born and raised, learned techniques, kidnapped and plundered, got married, and had children who entered the main sect… that peaceful history of the Black Ghost Bone Valley is now gone.”

He smiled gently.

“I appreciate the extended lifespan. Thanks to you, I can live for another hundred years. But I just want to enjoy this lifespan and close my eyes on the ship. By then, my disciple will have become a great celestial investigator like I was, and I will have no regrets.”

“…I understand. I respect your wishes.”

I nodded to Songjin, who refused the surgery. A hundred years was a long time, but for cultivators, it was a short time. Even Lin said that the road to Penglai would open in 120 years, so Songjin would close his eyes before then. But even after hearing such explanations from Seoran, Songjin showed no sign of changing his decision. He truly intended to close his eyes after raising Seoran.

I suddenly became curious about Songjin’s attitude and asked.

“May I ask you something?”

“Please do.”

“If you had to abandon your precious memories or feelings towards your fellow disciples to revive the Black Ghost Bone Valley, would you do it?”

Songjin pondered for a moment before answering.

“Abandoning my feelings for the Black Ghost Bone Valley to revive it… If I belonged to a group, it would be something I had to do.”

“Hmm….”

“But abandoning something itself is a ridiculous notion. Even if I abandoned my feelings for the Black Ghost Bone Valley, would the main sect abandon me?”

He smiled gently.

“Even if I abandoned my feelings for them, or even if I forgot my memories and became a monster, the main sect would remember me. That’s why I think it’s very difficult to completely ‘abandon’ or ‘cut off’ something. Human relationships are mutual connections. Even if one side cuts off, if the other side pulls, the connection remains.”

“…Thank you for the good answer.”

Celestial investigators were not just mediocre people with poor talents. They were people who had condensed their own madness to reach their level, and they had their own beliefs and answers about life. That’s why, even though Songjin had lived a shorter life and had a lower level than me, his answer contained his own wisdom.

“I’m just embarrassed. I just mixed my own understanding with the words I heard before.”

“Ho, who did you hear such words from?”

There were only a few people who could have spoken with Songjin, who was a celestial investigator in his lifetime. It would be the elders of the Black Ghost Bone Valley, the elders of the Changtian Kaibai Sect or the Jinshen Tianlei Sect, or the Sea Dragon Clan. It would be someone I knew, but surprisingly, Songjin mentioned someone else.

“I heard it from Seoran’s mother, who was a ghost disciple of the main sect.”

Songjin looked at Seoran with warm eyes.

‘He has changed a lot.’

Perhaps because he had been with Seoran for over 200 years, he used to be a bit prickly even if he cared for Seoran, calling him a Sea Dragon Clan member, but now he openly showed his affection for Seoran. Seoran also smiled warmly at Songjin’s words.

“…Master said that whenever my mother came to ask about the techniques, they talked a lot.”

“Yes, she was a truly lovely child. Yuo, that child….”

Songjin, who was talking to me, talked about Seoran and his mother, Yuo, for a while.

“Haha, we got sidetracked for a moment.”

“No, it’s fine. It’s good to see. Anyway, I think we’ve talked enough, so you two can have a good chat.”

I laughed heartily and left the room for the two master and disciple to talk. The ghostly creatures of the Guangyin Territory went down to the Black Road, teaching and helping the disciples of the Black Ghost Bone Valley in the Goryeo Realm. Although there were some cries and screams from below, it was nothing to worry about as ghostly creatures often made such sounds.

I went down to the basement of the Wujiao Sect, turning my attention to the flame well guarded by Hongfan and Yanwei.

“Is this the flame well obtained from the Zhenglong Palace?”

“Yes. The Zhenglong Palace Lord handed it over without resistance.”

Hongfan had set up a hidden formation with the flame well obtained from the Zhenglong Palace, allowing me to use it like a spiritual land. Yanwei grumbled discontentedly.

“I told you, that guy must be hiding something more. It’s highly likely that he handed over such a precious treasure to hide something even more valuable. My eyes can’t be fooled!!”

She crossed her arms and glared slightly at Hongfan.

“No, listen, Yinhyun. When I suggested to Hongfan that we should feed Lin a poison that amplifies pain by 60,000 times and torture him, he said no. Isn’t he being too lenient just because they’re both of the same race, or does he have some other intention?”

“Yanwei, senior….”

Hongfan waved his hands with a bewildered face.

“The poison that amplifies pain by 60,000 times is too dangerous, even for a combined king. No matter how much of an enemy he is, what did the Zhenglong Palace Lord do to deserve such torture?”

I shook my head and said.

“Hongfan is right. The poison that amplifies pain by 60,000 times is too much.”

There was no reason to subject him to such harsh torture just to find hidden treasures when he hadn’t betrayed us or put us in a difficult situation. Yanwei, unable to get my approval either, turned her head with a sulky face.

“Hmph. If it were Lin, he would have taken all the inheritance of the Zhenglong Palace Lord… I feel like I’ll regret it if we lose those treasures because we weren’t harsh enough….”

“Well, we can look for such great treasures later. For now, let’s focus on building the Gangnyeong Pillar.”

“Do as you please. Why ask an old woman like me?”

She left the basement in a huff, and I sighed, letting my consciousness drift. According to Lin, the road to Penglai would open in about 120 years. Until then, I planned to obtain as many Gangnyeong Pillars as possible.

* * *

Pyeongun Continent. At the end of it, in the Yuhwa Kingdom, three extreme celestial investigators and one demigod controlled the kingdom. Among them, the only demigod of the Yuhwa Kingdom. After the collapse of the Absolute Ghost Valley, the celestial investigator who settled in the nearby Black Ridge Valley. The Battle God Hamjin was also praying that day, bowing respectfully on a small altar in the eastern part, with a bowl of water placed on it.

And it was at that moment.

Clatter, clatter―

Suddenly, the water bowl trembled, and the water turned black.

“Hah…!”

And as Hamjin regained his senses, he found himself drawn into a pure white mental world. In the mental world, he bowed his head, facing the great Ghost King, the Wujiao Ghost King.

“Great one, did you call for me?”

The Wujiao Ghost King looked down at him and spoke.

“I need to borrow your body. Have you kept the jade token safe?”

“Yes, I have always kept it with me.”

“Good. Let’s go to that place right away.”

Hamjin nodded, and as soon as he gave his permission, the Wujiao Ghost King took control of his body.

* * *

Crackle! After taking control of Hamjin’s body, I moved it around.

“Ho, excellent.”

How long had it been? Hamjin had already reached the level of a second-stage celestial investigator.

―You flatter me.

Hamjin showed humility from within his mind, but in my eyes, his talent was truly outstanding.

‘No, maybe Hamjin’s unique talent has continued to blossom because I often possessed his body.’

Whether his talent was originally good or improved because of me, it didn’t matter. As I was about to leave Hamjin’s eastern part, a woman called out to him from another room, rubbing her eyes and wearing a disheveled outfit.

“Husband, where are you going?”

Hamjin, flustered from within, said.

―Just wave her away.

I waved my hand as he instructed, and she bowed politely and retreated.

“Did you get married?”

―Ah, well… previously, the demigods had disciples or followers, but it seems they placed a curse that would kill their followers or disciples if they died. So, I’m the only demigod left in the Yuhwa Kingdom… and many cultivation families kept bringing up marriage proposals….

“Well, it’s your business….”

“Husband, are you skipping breakfast today?”

But soon after, another woman came out from another room in the eastern part and asked Hamjin, and I waved her away as well, trying to leave the eastern part. However, as I left the eastern part, I kept encountering Hamjin’s wives coming out of various rooms.

“…What kind of life are you living?”

After waving away the 17th wife and stepping outside, I couldn’t help but ask in disbelief. Hamjin coughed awkwardly.

―I didn’t forcefully take them. They were really sent by the cultivation families. They begged to stay, saying they would have to marry older demigods from other countries if they returned….

“….”

I clicked my tongue and used Hamjin’s body to manipulate gravity, arriving at the previous location. Since Hamjin had reached the celestial investigator level, there was much more I could do with his body.

Rumble! Grasping the air, gravity twisted. I took out the jade token from Hamjin’s bosom and activated it. On the vast land that had become an empty field after the collapse of the Absolute Ghost Valley, a green formation emitted light. Soon, I sensed the surrounding space transforming into an ‘intermediate zone.’

Buzz! Reading the gravitational flow of the intermediate zone, I calculated the coordinates. The intermediate zone not only connected the seas of the Goryeo Realm but also allowed one to traverse vast spaces more easily. In other words, the place the elders headed to, the Thunder Sound Sea, was so far away that an intermediate zone had to be created.

Buzz! Connecting the coordinates and gravity with my consciousness, I pulled the coordinates. Rumble! In an instant, Hamjin’s body traversed an immense space. From within, Hamjin marveled at the sight through my eyes. Surrounding us were countless stars, nebulae, and galaxies. Just seeing this vast world seemed to have an awakening effect, as Hamjin’s upper dantian seemed to awaken further.

‘This guy’s level will rise faster.’

It was a good thing for me. How long had we traversed the space? Finally, I arrived at the next set of coordinates.

‘This place…?’

Boom, boom! Lightning struck everywhere. Toxic gases floated in the atmosphere, and sandstorms raged in the dry desert. It seemed like a planet where no life could survive.

‘Is this the Thunder Sound Sea? No… it’s not.’

I realized that another intermediate zone had been set up here. I reactivated the intermediate zone.

‘So, the Thunder Sound Sea is so far away that the elders had to create more intermediate zones.’

It meant that a single intermediate zone was not enough to reach the place. I activated the gravity again from the intermediate zone, moving to the next set of coordinates.

Buzz! This time, it was a planet without air. It was like the moon, with low gravity and a barren landscape. It seemed like another place where no life could survive. And….

‘Another intermediate zone?’

I was slightly taken aback. How far was the Thunder Sound Sea that the elders had set up so many intermediate zones? I remembered that the White Cloud Sage had said that Zhang Yi sent his avatar a thousand years later.

‘Perhaps, even the elders who travel through vast spaces
