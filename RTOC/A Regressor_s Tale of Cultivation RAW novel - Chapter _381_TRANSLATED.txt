### Return to Cultivation (Chapter 381): Together with Everyone (3)

Song Jin's death was sudden, but not entirely unexpected. He had previously mentioned his lifespan, and since he had refused my treatments and the puppet body, it was his time to go. He lived beyond his natural lifespan and passed away.

Seoran placed Song Jin's ashes into the Sepmyung Box. The Sepmyung Box, repaired by Bukhyanghwa, became Song Jin's tomb and gravestone. We held a grand funeral for Song Jin. Seoran sat atop the Sepmyung Box, gazing at the sky. I sat beside him and asked, "Are you sad?"

Seoran replied, "Master said something to me before he passed away."

"What did he say?"

He stroked the Sepmyung Box and said, "My mother, when she lived in the mortal world, was always afraid of death when she was young. She was so terrified that she sometimes screamed in fear."

"…"

"But when she had me, she risked her life to give birth to me, even though it could have endangered her life."

I listened silently to Seoran's words.

"Master said, 'Those who have something precious are not afraid of death.' He cherished me and said he had no regrets after seeing his disciple grow up."

Seoran wiped his tears while looking at the sky. "He showed no fear or sadness when he passed away. So, I will not be sad either."

Tears were clearly flowing from his eyes, but I couldn't read his emotions. Or rather, I could read them, but I couldn't understand what they were. The Five Emotions and Seven Desires technique requires understanding all emotions, but in truth, it's impossible to read every emotion. One must accept this fact to reach that level. Therefore, I couldn't read Seoran's emotions.

Kim Younghoon said that a warrior imbues their will into their weapon. If a master pours everything into their disciple, are they still a warrior? After comforting Seoran, I floated into the air, giving him some alone time. As I looked at Seoran sitting on the Sepmyung Box, I realized something. Seoran resembled Song Jin more than Seohyeol now. He had entrusted even his appearance to his disciple.

'If imbuing one's will into a weapon makes one a warrior, then all masters in this world are supreme warriors.'

The connections and bonds formed between people. Could human relationships also be considered martial arts? Pondering this, I left Seoran and returned to the battlefield. And I realized that Song Jin's death had brought tears to my eyes.

"…Ah."

I wasn't particularly sad. Song Jin was a good person, and I owed him many favors, but there were also times when I almost got scammed or killed because of him. I learned some techniques from him, but I never considered him a master like Cheongmunryeong. I wasn't sad. But, like Seoran, I was shedding tears. And from those tears, I finally found the reason for the rampage of my Ten Thousand Connections Path.

Imbuing one's will into a weapon is martial arts. And exchanging wills between people is a bond. Sometimes, when a bond is disrupted, emotions become uncontrollable. You can't return anything to the dead. The emotions overflow because of the many things received from the deceased. My Ten Thousand Connections Path was the same. I received too much from people in my past life. But now, there are things I can never return. I succeeded in imbuing my will into my weapon. But the will was too much, causing an overflow. The many favors I received made my sword rampage and explode.

I didn't hold my sword that month and quietly mourned Song Jin. Even if I didn't receive much from him or have a deep bond with him, he was undoubtedly my connection. And several decades passed.

Rumble! The heavens shook with a celestial tribulation in the Guangyin Realm. Crackle! Seoran was breaking through his realm. After enduring the tribulation for a while, Seoran proudly displayed his mid-stage Celestial Human cultivation.

"Congratulations, Seoran."

I smiled at Seoran, who now appeared entirely human, with no trace of his Yao characteristics. Following my praise, others also showered Seoran with congratulations. In the Qi-rich Gaoliu Realm, Song Jin's death had planted a seed of madness in Seoran. Eventually, Seoran used that seed to rapidly advance to the mid-stage Celestial Human. However, Seoran didn't seem particularly happy about reaching the mid-stage Celestial Human.

"I'm not that great. The truly amazing one is… Shiho."

And as soon as Seoran finished speaking, an enormous celestial tribulation struck from afar. Under the shadow of that tribulation, Shiho was seen crying out. Shiho had recently consumed a tremendous spiritual fruit from the depths of the Gaoliu Realm, causing his cultivation to surge, and he was now reaching the Sacrifice Stage. How long did the thunder and lightning rage in the sky? When we flew over, Shiho was barely standing, coughing up blood. Hongbeom laughed beside him.

"He almost died enduring the thunder tribulation, but Shiho has successfully reached the Sacrifice Stage."

Seeing us, Shiho ran to Seoran, crying. "Waaah! Seoran! I almost died!"

Seoran looked exasperated but seemed to have accepted it, no longer showing the same disgust as before. I laughed heartily and congratulated the two who had safely endured the tribulation.

"Both of you have safely completed the tribulation, bringing great fortune to our Wuge Sect."

"Thank you."

"Thank you, Sect Leader. And… may you also safely complete your thunder tribulation!"

"Yes."

I turned my head and looked back. At the center of the Wuge Sect, on the roof of the Wuge Pavilion, my main body was preparing to face the tribulation.

"Well then… shall I face the tribulation now?"

About a hundred and twenty years had passed. I had finally completed the Kangning Pillars. Unlike before, I had rapidly accumulated them by receiving lifespans in large quantities of 100 to 200 years instead of 10-year increments from the lower realms.

"Well then. I'm off to complete the pillars."

Whoosh! I reabsorbed my seated meditation clone back into my main body. Hummm! I drew the dragon veins of the Black Road in the Gaoliu Realm through the Guangyin Realm. Tremendous power surged around me. I surrounded myself with twelve flames created from the Qi of the Gaoliu Realm and closed my eyes. I offered a ritual to the Gaoliu Realm. I tore away ten thousand years of my lifespan!

Rumble! I converted all ten thousand years of lifespan into Kangning Pillars! Whoosh! And I returned the accumulated lifespan of the Kangning Pillars to the Gaoliu Realm. Hummm! As the Kangning Pillars were properly established, shadows danced beneath my feet, and I felt the emptiness of the Six Extremes. With this, I had established the pillars of Longevity, Wealth, and Kangning. I felt the Six Extremes more clearly than before. The Six Extremes, which had been mere shadows beneath my feet, now floated around me like eerie ghosts. Previously, the Six Extremes emitted black thunder, but recently, these shadows no longer emitted thunder. They just hovered around me, as if hungry and starving. But I paid no mind and embraced the pillars of Longevity, Wealth, and Kangning. Thus, I reached the late stage of the Sacrifice Stage.

Rumble, rumble! The sky trembled with blue and golden thunder. Though there was no sky, the dreaded celestial tribulation still occurred in the Gaoliu Realm. A terrifyingly powerful tribulation descended upon me! But as I moved my hand, the dark clouds that brought the tribulation were pierced with a massive hole, and the tribulation scattered. Countless Wuge Sect spirits witnessed this and cried out in joy.

-Screeeech!

-Screeeech!

'The tribulation at the Sacrifice Stage level is no longer frightening.'

Honestly, the tribulation had long become more of a celebratory firework for realm advancement. However, the tribulation would become increasingly difficult to handle from the Fusion Stage, and from the Consolidation Stage, it would be at a level where it seemed to demand death rather than survival. So, I couldn't let my guard down against the tribulation.

Whooosh- I closed my eyes and floated the three pillars around me. The Six Extremes Pillar had only taken shape and had no real power or spiritual force, so it was practically non-existent. 'The Six Extremes Pillar seems to be completed only when the Five Blessings Pillar is perfected.' Like how shadows deepen as light intensifies. The three pillars formed a plane. In any case, I could now deploy the Pillar Barrier. I extended my hand over the plane. Whooosh- As a practitioner of the Sacrifice Stage, my Pillar Barrier was somewhat predetermined. Whoosh! An endless desolate gray desert appeared on the plane. The sky and the ground were only gray, resembling the outskirts of the underworld. This was the appearance of my Pillar Barrier. However, I could add a few things I wanted here. Whooosh! I floated the Ten Thousand Connections Path above the desolate desert. Countless connections of the Ten Thousand Connections Path floated in the sky, coloring the world. The connections of the Ten Thousand Connections Path emitted light. The light they emitted, like auroras, illuminated the desert. Of course, to others, it would just look like a bleak desert covered with hazy clouds, but it didn't matter. This Pillar Barrier was now my world. Whooosh! I deployed the Pillar Barrier. The endless desert land covered the surroundings. A typical Sacrifice Stage practitioner wouldn't be able to cover even a tenth of the Guangyin Realm with their Pillar Barrier, but perhaps thanks to the Guanghan Celestial Origin and the Six Extremes Pillar. Or maybe thanks to the Three-Tai Chi. I covered the entire Guangyin Realm with my Pillar Barrier like a Fusion Stage practitioner. All the spirits of the sect listened to my words. Why did I choose today, of all days, to face the tribulation and advance in realm? Only the power of a certain artifact in that secret cave can help the one I seek to save. Also, the secret I seek to uncover and my cultivation method can benefit from the power of that artifact! Therefore, I am heading to that secret cave. However, in that cave, one's cultivation is reduced to the level of a mere beast or a lowly spirit. Therefore, I seek your help in that cave. Help me, and I will save those who follow me. This is not related to the sect but is a personal matter of mine, so there is no compulsion. Those who wish to come may come, and those who do not wish to come may stay. I ask you as a fellow member of the Wuge Sect, not as your leader. Will you help me?

Three days later. According to Yukrin, the Penglai Island would open. The Salt Mountain on Penglai Island. And the countless treasures within, including the Pillar Cultivation Ritual Book and the Yuho Virtue Ritual Book. There was so much to gain. And according to Yukrin's information, it was a very dangerous place. Even if my or Kim Younghoon's power was restricted, there seemed to be restrictions that even our power couldn't overcome. Therefore, I announced this to the entire Wuge Sect to solve it with the sect's 'numbers.' And immediately after my announcement, the spirits and the Yao who had joined the Wuge Sect from the Gaoliu Realm cheered. They all declared they would join me, and I smiled at them. With them, this life must be different from the previous ones. I will surely save Cheongmunryeong, uncover the secrets of the Taesan Yeolje Gong, and prepare to advance to the next stage. Definitely!

After my declaration, countless new Yao believers from other branches of the Wuge Sect also declared they would join the Penglai Island expedition. And three days later.

"Is this the place?"

"Yes."

We arrived at a small sea area with Yukrin leading the way. It was called the Parrot Dragon Sea, where a Sacrifice Stage master ruled instead of a proper lord. "It will reveal itself at night. Today is a special day." Rumble! As night fell, the sky was filled with Yin energy. The 'Ring of Light' that signaled daytime in each sea area dimmed, and darkness covered the surroundings. Normally, the Ring of Light would emit moonlight, but for some reason, it didn't today. Yukrin said, "Today is the day when the Holy Master of the Sea stops supplying light to the entire sea area once every few hundred years. It's a day when only darkness remains. Because the Holy Master binds the dimensional barrier of the Gaoliu Realm and forbids 'light' itself, no light shines in any sea area." Rumble! Of course, everyone here had no problem with the lack of light, so they extended their consciousness to grasp the surroundings. And then, the deep sea ahead suddenly began to 'split.' "The island that only reveals itself on a day without light. That is Penglai Island." I led the Guangyin Realm towards the splitting deep sea. 'Like the Sunset Island of the Dragon Hermit, hidden secret caves always reveal their entrances on days without light.' I had a few random thoughts as I finally moved the land of the Guangyin Realm completely over the split deep sea. "Can you see below?" Rumble! Below the deep sea. Something like a massive barrier was caught in my consciousness. "That barrier is Penglai Island. Since the Holy Master's rules don't apply inside, there will be its own light, so don't be surprised if it suddenly brightens." "Thanks for the detailed information." Following Yukrin's explanation, I lowered the Guangyin Realm towards the barrier. Since the entire Wuge Sect was heading to Penglai Island, I had brought the entire Guangyin Realm. This meant that the entire Wuge Sect's interests were tied to this Penglai Island expedition. 'The burden is heavy.' Thinking that the Wuge Sect was on my shoulders, my shoulders felt stiff. Rumble! As the Guangyin Realm finally approached the barrier. Whoosh! Suddenly, a familiar ship appeared from the split deep sea wall! "That's…!" The Bone Ship of the Tumah Pirates! Yukrin's face twisted in anger as he saw it! "Damn it! What are they doing here! Stop them! Penglai Island is structured so that the first ones to enter gain the most benefits!" I frowned and tried to shoot a sword aura. But then, from behind the Bone Ship, a massive darkness surged, and several deep-sea monsters emerged. The Tumah Pirates had brought a horde of deep-sea monsters. And while we were dealing with the deep-sea monsters, the Tumah Pirates entered the barrier of Penglai Island slightly ahead of the Guangyin Realm. Whoosh! And soon after, the Guangyin Realm also entered the barrier, but Yukrin grumbled. "What a shame. Those thieves will gain more benefits!" "Be quiet." Rumble! As the Guangyin Realm finally fully entered the barrier, I widened my eyes at what I saw. It was a massive Salt Mountain. Above the Salt Mountain was a pure white palace made entirely of salt, and the Salt Mountain suddenly emitted a bright white light. And all of us, including myself, lost consciousness.

Blink! I opened my eyes. "…Where is this?"
