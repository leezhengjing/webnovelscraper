She shivered! I hastily stepped back and spoke with a smiling face. "Hello, Master Gui. Master Gui, you..."

"Now that I think about it, you’re that kid who followed me when I ascended! Such a pretty one. You want to be my disciple, don’t you? What are you doing, you? Quickly take this admirable child and let’s give them a new life!"

Master Gui's eyes widened as he began manipulating [her]. 'Damn it, let’s just get to the point quickly.'

"Master Gui, please listen to me. Do you know that Seohyeol is getting married?"

"What!!!"

Master Gui's eyes rolled back completely as he shouted. "No way, that Seohyeol! How could he hold such an important event without telling me! This won’t do! You, take me to where Seohyeol is right now!"

"..."

For some reason, I felt a chill down my spine. 'Damn it, continuing this conversation is exhausting.' It was fortunate that I understood Master Gui's logic.

"Yes. I will guide you immediately. First, please head to the Mysterious Fortress and activate it. You must hurry to 'bless' Seohyeol, right?"

"Yes, yes, yes. Good idea. Follow me!"

Master Gui tore through space with [her] and entered the Mysterious Fortress. I had no choice but to follow him, feeling [her] gaze cutting off my escape route from behind. After leaving a message for Jeon Myunghun to stay outside the Mysterious Fortress, I infiltrated it.

"Now, where should we go? Where can we bless Seohyeol?"

'Seohyeol is nowhere to be found at this point...'

It seemed best to offer the Black Dragon King Hyeon-eum as a substitute for Seohyeol.

"Go to these coordinates. This is where Seohyeol will receive the blessings of all."

After informing Master Gui of the eastern location of the Black Dragon King Hyeon-eum, I stepped back. Master Gui's eyes rolled back as he began manipulating the Mysterious Fortress, and soon the fortress floated into the air. I shouted loudly at Master Gui.

"I will take a look around this place where I will live from now on!"

"Oh, yes, yes. You’re checking out your new home. Got it. Go quickly and be reborn."

"Thank you!"

After saying that, I left the control room of the Mysterious Fortress. 'I already feel mentally exhausted.' It was truly difficult to let my guard down even for a moment while conversing with him. As I exited the control room, I looked around the Mysterious Fortress.

'Terrifying...'

The puppets of the Mysterious Fortress were each pretending to live in a society. And the 'factories' they operated were mass-producing puppets everywhere. The horrifying part was that the corpses of beings who seemed to be at the level of the Grandmasters were hanging everywhere. Nearly 30 corpses of Grandmasters. And the spiritual pressure of six Grandmaster-level beings could be felt everywhere.

'In my past life, the reason he could create so many Grandmaster-level puppets within 100 days was because he already had plenty of materials. Judging by the corpses of the Grandmasters, if he had taken more time, he could have made 60 instead of 28.'

No matter how much I had become a Grandmaster-level force, if Master Gui lost his mind, I too would end up hanging there. If I didn’t want to become something like General Seo or something similar, I couldn’t let my guard down for even a moment. There were already six Grandmaster-level puppets made. Even Hyeonwon would become a mere toy if he faced Master Gui.

'I said I was visiting the Grandmaster Assembly, but I ended up in the deepest part of the Mysterious Fortress.'

Originally, I planned to call Kim Yeon outside the Mysterious Fortress and take her away, but the plan went a bit awry.

'Well, if the plan goes awry, I’ll just adapt.'

I was well-versed in the Mysterious Fortress, so I had a way. I began searching for Kim Yeon.

Zzzzt!

My consciousness resonated through the Mysterious Heart Transmission. I located Kim Yeon.

Flash!

"Yeon-ah!"

I ran to her in one breath. I found Kim Yeon inside a mansion made of puppets.

"Eunhyeon oppa! You were captured too!"

Kim Yeon ran to me with a tearful face, and I shook my head.

"No, I came to rescue you."

"What?"

She looked up at me with tears streaming down her face.

"What do you mean? How can we get out of here? It’s impossible. If it were before we were captured, maybe, but now that we’re inside the Mysterious Fortress..."

I shook my head and held her hand.

"No, it’s definitely possible. We just need to create a momentary gap."

I felt Kim Yeon's consciousness. Her cultivation had already reached the Celestial Human stage, and her consciousness was at the level of a Grandmaster.

"By the way, Yeon-ah. Did you complete the task I gave you?"

"What?"

I patted her shoulder with a reassuring expression.

"Show me."

"Is that important right now?"

"Yes. The chances of escape increase with your growth."

I connected to the Mysterious Heart Transmission to prevent Master Gui from eavesdropping on our conversation and spoke to her. After a while, she took out a fan from the Dimensional Island and began to perform the Biik Dance in front of me.

Zzzzt!

Her movements were those of a perfect first-class master. At the same time, I saw her consciousness moving in perfect harmony with the flow of her thoughts, and my eyes sparkled.

"Good. You’ve reached the pinnacle!"

"Yes. As you said, oppa, at some point, my consciousness became more detailed... and the color of my thoughts became clearer."

Master Gui's consciousness technique itself opens the path to the Three Flowers Gathering and the Five Qi Dynasties. Therefore, if one masters the Mysterious Heart Transmission and martial arts to reach the pinnacle, it would show the same effect as a martial artist who has dedicated their life to reaching the Three Flowers Gathering and the Five Qi Dynasties. In theory, she was already a master of the Five Qi Dynasties. Of course, due to the difference in martial arts proficiency, she would lose in a pure martial arts battle against an actual master of the Five Qi Dynasties...

'Anyway, Kim Yeon’s main strength isn’t martial arts, so it doesn’t matter.'

The important thing was that she could use the Moon Water Palace Record from the Three Flowers Gathering. It was impossible with just the Mysterious Heart Transmission. At least the pinnacle level of martial arts was required to use the Moon Water Palace Record.

"Now, Yeon-ah. I will enter your body from now on."

Buzz!

I raised a strong aura on my hand and began to explain.

"Knowing Master Gui’s personality, he will soon come to capture me, saying I haven’t returned. When he comes to capture me, I will escape with you outside the Mysterious Fortress. Once we’re outside, you will see Jeon Myunghun. Run to him immediately."

Jeon Myunghun's Thunderous Sky Technique had a unique spell. It was the Return Thunder Strike. This spell, often called the Rebound Thunder Strike, was based on the basic properties of thunder. Heavenly thunder strikes from the sky to the ground, and the lightning created at that moment follows the path back from the ground to the sky. The lightning returns to the sky. This spell, based on such properties, was often used to recover the power of the thunder technique used.

'But in this situation, the best use is to escape.'

Using the Rebound Thunder Strike, Jeon Myunghun created a 'path of lightning' as he flew here. And when we return, we can follow the 'path of lightning' Jeon Myunghun created to return at a speed far faster than when we came. With my help, the speed would be no different from using a teleportation array.

"And while I buy time in front of Master Gui, entrust your body and consciousness to the strong aura I placed inside you. Then we can escape."

"..."

She looked anxious. I smiled at her and patted her shoulder.

"It’s okay, we will succeed."

"...Yes. I believe you."

She hesitated but soon accepted my strong aura. I merged the strange energy I had planted in her with the strong aura and settled in her consciousness. Our consciousnesses became more closely connected through the Mysterious Heart Transmission. And then it happened. Master Gui's voice echoed throughout the Mysterious Fortress.

"It’s time...!"

I held Kim Yeon's hand and simultaneously activated the Mysterious Heart Transmission. At the same time, her vast consciousness was controlled by me and permeated the Mysterious Fortress. In an instant, the control of the Mysterious Fortress was transferred to us.

'This will last for 3 seconds.'

And 3 seconds was enough. I took out the Colorless Glass Sword and held it in my other hand.

Mountain Severing!

Crash!

While the Grandmaster-level puppets were immobilized, my sword strike pierced through one side of the Mysterious Fortress.

Boom!

I moved with her in the frozen world and quickly exited. 'That took 1 second.' The Mysterious Fortress was tougher than expected, taking 1 second. 'In the remaining 2 seconds...'

At that moment.

"What!"

Master Gui regained control in an instant. I gritted my teeth and exited the Mysterious Fortress, throwing Kim Yeon with all my might towards Jeon Myunghun, who was waiting in the distance.

"Ahhh!"

"Yeon-ah, as I told you!"

I hurriedly finished speaking and turned to face Master Gui. Clank, clank, clank...! The Mysterious Fortress reactivated, and the power of an entire race could be felt from inside.

'Crazy old man, how can you become a one-man race-level force in just 100 years?'

It was something I felt every life, but it was always astonishing. Rumble! Master Gui, standing next to [her], began manipulating the puppets without hiding his anger.

'Good. He’s stepping forward to take Kim Yeon.'

I shouted with all my might. Even if I leave here, I must land a blow on Master Gui.

"Master Gui! We will borrow your disciple. We will ensure she grows even more righteously..."

I took a stance and infused my original spirit into the Colorless Glass Sword.

"Please forgive us just this once!"

Flash!

Mountain Severing!

My original spirit became a beam of light and struck Master Gui in the center of the Mysterious Fortress. Rumble!

"What!"

In an instant, Master Gui couldn’t avoid the rapidly accelerating Mountain Severing technique and was hit. And I entered Master Gui's consciousness. If Seohyeol's mental image was hell, Master Gui's mental image was purgatory. Therefore, I felt that I wouldn’t be completely mentally corrupted inside and used all my strength to purify Master Gui's mind.

Zzzzt!

Flash!

At the same time, I felt Master Gui's chaotic mind clear for a moment. 'It won’t last long!' Flash! I exited Master Gui's consciousness and retrieved my original spirit. It was a gamble that could have ended this life, but it succeeded!

"...Amazing. What was that just now?"

Master Gui looked at me with eyes cleared of madness by the Mountain Severing technique. I answered calmly.

"The technique is called Mountain Severing. Think of it as a kind of... heart sword."

"Is that so..."

He smiled bitterly and said.

"Go. Free my disciple from me. Anyway, my current interest is focused on blessing Seohyeol, so I won’t chase you until I catch Seohyeol."

"Thank you."

He rubbed his face and said.

"My state won’t last long, so go quickly! Hurry!"

I bowed to Master Gui and flew towards Kim Yeon and Jeon Myunghun.

"Let’s go!"

Even without showing the Biik Spear, I had turned his consciousness once. This meant that I could show the Biik Spear in front of him later to gain another chance. I held Kim Yeon's hand again, placed my hand on Jeon Myunghun's shoulder, and used the strong aura clone I had placed in Kim Yeon. Master Gui began to howl again. It seemed his reason was trying to suppress the madness, but it wouldn’t last long!

"Let’s go!"

Kim Yeon's consciousness, at the level of a Grandmaster, was wielded by me to complete a formula. Her understanding of martial arts at the pinnacle level combined with it, and the formula manifested as martial arts in the world.

Moon Water Palace Record!

Flash!

The consciousness at the level of a Grandmaster moved, erasing our existence from Master Gui's perception.

"Jeon Myunghun!"

"Got it!"

Simultaneously, Jeon Myunghun used the Rebound Thunder Strike spell. Crackle! Our bodies were enveloped in lightning, and we returned at a speed close to teleportation. Rumble! However, as I felt Master Gui's madness winning, I grabbed Jeon Myunghun's shoulder and placed a strong aura clone in him, accelerating Jeon Myunghun.

Zzzzt!

Jeon Myunghun accelerated further, and we moved at a transcendent speed away from the Mysterious Fortress. Flash! The Mysterious Fortress became a speck on the horizon and soon disappeared completely from our consciousness. Kim Yeon watched the scene with tears in her eyes.

"Oppa, I..."

"Yes."

I hugged Kim Yeon.

"Congratulations on escaping."

Jeon Myunghun watched us and touched the wooden box in his arms. Crack! And [her] left arm grabbed my leg.

"Aaaah!!!"
