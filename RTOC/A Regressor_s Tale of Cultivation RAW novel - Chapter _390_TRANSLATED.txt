### Return to Cultivation (회귀수선전) Chapter 390: Salt (6)

‘Is he insane?’ thought Yukrin. He could feel it. From below, the power emanating from Seo Eunhyun was undoubtedly the power of Bongrae. The origin of Bongrae's power was unknown, and even in the Goryeok Realm, it was considered a legendary force. When Bongrae's power surged, the seas of the Goryeok Realm would resonate, amplifying its strength. And that was all.

‘Foolishness!’ It wasn't mere overconfidence. The power of Yeomhaeguiro-ok was a divine skill that became stronger the more high-quality salt it absorbed. And the pinnacle of Yeomhaeguiro-ok's power was this very salt crystal. This precious salt crystal, not just a piece but an entire chunk, was in his hands.

‘At this moment, I am at my peak!’ The seemingly infinite power surged from the palace of salt crystals, adding to Yukrin's dragon wave. And then...

‘...What?’ Yeomhaeguiro-ok began to falter. Yukrin's eyes widened. A voice could be heard from below. It was the voice of the charcoal-like monster, Seo Eunhyun. It was like a whisper. No, it was indeed a whisper. Seo Eunhyun, unknowingly, was whispering as he activated his technique. However, the Goryeok Realm resonated, amplifying the whisper itself. It seemed as if Seo Eunhyun's whisper was spreading throughout the entire sea area they were in.

Rumble! Yukrin's dragon wave was being pushed back. Of course, Yukrin had not unleashed Yeomhaeguiro-ok's dragon wave to defeat them but for another purpose, and his intention had been faithfully reflected so far. Bongrae Island, which had been fixed in the deep sea, was gradually sinking further. And as daylight approached, the path to Bongrae Island was gradually closing. In any case, Yukrin was the victor. However, Yukrin could not accept it.

‘The Yeomhaeguiro-ok, which I devoted my entire life to obtaining... Even with the pure body of a sea dragon, Yeomhaeguiro-ok, and a chunk of salt crystal, is being pushed back by the power of Bongrae! A power that, though unique, isn't even rumored to be that strong, is pushing back the pinnacle of the Goryeok Realm!?’ 

A dark red demonic energy began to emanate from his body. Yukrin's life force began to rampage. ‘Even if I have to sacrifice my lifespan, I will win!’ Burning the life force of the sea dragon's bloodline he had finally obtained, he screamed as he unleashed his dragon wave. The stream of the dragon wave, imbued with the power of Yeomhaeguiro-ok, grew even thicker. And then...

Seo Eunhyun's light began to shine even brighter.

* * *

Rumble! The entire Goryeok Realm shook for a moment. At the center of the Goryeok Realm, the highest mountain in the Chije Region, Haewang Mountain. From the Haewang Hall at the mountain's peak, a groan of pain echoed, filling the entire Chije and Dogeo Regions.

“Holy Master!!!”

“Holy Master! What is happening!!!”

“Haerin Holy Master!”

The combined Qi Kings, who served the Holy Master Haerin of the Goryeok Realm, gathered in front of the Haewang Hall, calling out to Haerin. At the center of the Haewang Hall, above the coral throne, Haerin was trembling, blood flowing from his eyes.

“...M...utter... the incantation... the incantation...!”

Gush! He spat out a mouthful of blood, gasping for breath. “He obtained it...! So that's why the beings of the Myungui Realm collectively fainted! They were so desperate that they threw it into the Goryeok Realm...!”

Crack. He gritted his teeth. Haerin's entire body trembled, his face filled with fear. “It wasn't just... obtaining the legacy of that person...? To be able to unfold it, haha... In that case...”

Haerin, whose eyes had become empty, leaned against the throne, letting out a hollow laugh. “...This life is about to end... How futile...”

* * *

The light grew brighter. I discovered a new aspect of this divine power that overturned the Taesan Yeolje.

“Combine!!!”

“We will add our strength too!”

“Hold on, Seo Eunhyun!”

Oh Hyunseok, Kim Younghoon, Jeon Myunghoon, Kim Yeon, Buk Hyanghwa... And the entire Muguk Cult. All of them added their strength. And that power entered the inside of the reverse pyramid, naturally merging and further enlarging the reverse pyramid. As the reverse pyramid grew, it pushed back the dragon wave of Yeomhaeguiro-ok. If this continued, we could push back Yukrin and win!

‘Everyone is together!’ We cannot lose!!!

“Haaaaa!!!” The dragon wave of Yeomhaeguiro-ok, which was opposing all our strength, gradually thinned, and finally! The dragon wave disappeared! And then...

“Haaa! Haa... Ah...?” I saw a [hand] emerging from behind Yukrin. It was a hand covered in scales.

Rumble! And just like that, the remnants of Yeomhaeguiro-ok, which were about to be shot into the sky, were crushed by the hand. Crack! When we entered Bongrae Island, we floated inside the barrier after entering the Bongrae Island barrier. Even if we all fell asleep, the floating formation would be maintained. However, the floating formation was rendered meaningless as the Guangyin Region fell straight to the ground of Bongrae Island. Due to the merciless gravitational force, we all knelt, and the divine power that had reversed the Taesan Yeolje shattered and disappeared. Simultaneously, Bongrae Island, under the influence of the hand's gravitational force, sank even deeper into the deep sea. I looked up at the sky with a stunned face. The path through the deep sea we used to enter was completely closed. All that could be seen around were the endless deep sea and countless dimensional fragments within it. No... there was one more thing. It was the massive flow of misfortune that enveloped me despairingly.

Boom! I struck Bongrae Island with all my might. “...Oh heavens....” Due to the sudden appearance of the hand, the entire Muguk Cult and Bongrae Island were trapped deep in the deep sea.

* * *

Yukrin stared blankly at the sea. It was a close call. If it weren't for the sudden strike from Haerin Holy Master, he didn't know what would have happened to him due to the power of Bongrae rising from below. It seemed they weren't dead, but the entire Muguk Cult was trapped in the deep sea. There was no way out. Yukrin bowed deeply in the direction where the Holy Master's hand had appeared. Haerin did not respond, and the hand disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared.

“Haha...! Congratulations, Dragon Palace Lord. Not only have you been restored, but you have also finally achieved your wish. As promised, share some of the salt crystals with us.”

Then, Jinmayeol, who had helped Yukrin pull up the palace of salt crystals, appeared and spoke to Yukrin. Yukrin looked at Jinmayeol for a moment before opening his mouth. Swish! And it happened in an instant. Jinmayeol's pupils seemed to turn purple. However, Jinmayeol, being eroded by the self-soul myriad heavens, swung his arm instead. Whoosh! Slash! A huge wound appeared on Yukrin's body, who had exhausted his strength using Yeomhaeguiro-ok. Jinmayeol, with a face full of ecstasy, grabbed a handful of Yukrin's blood and threw it somewhere, and Yukrin struck Jinmayeol with his front paw. Boom! Jinmayeol's entire body exploded. Yukrin's attack continued. Even though he was exhausted, the attacks from a combined Qi master to an initial combined Qi master were relentless. It didn't take long for Jinmayeol's domain to explode, leaving only his head intact, with all other parts torn apart. However, even then, Jinmayeol laughed.

“Heh, hehahaha! Hahaha! As expected, you were hiding the self-soul myriad heavens, Dragon Palace Lord! But I must thank you. Thanks to you, I learned how to operate the self-soul myriad heavens! I also obtained your blood... Now, all that's left is... only...”

Jinmayeol's head, losing its vitality, spoke. “Immortality...”

Yukrin, with an expressionless face, looked at the place where Jinmayeol had disappeared, then, with an annoyed expression, exerted gravitational force inside the palace of salt crystals. Rumble... And Yukyo was pulled out. The self-soul myriad heavens that Yukrin had placed on Jinmayeol had transferred to Yukyo. Yukrin clicked his tongue and withdrew the secret technique from Yukyo's mind. From his perspective, devouring Yukyo would be a loss. He roughly threw Yukyo inside the palace of salt crystals and smiled slyly. Yukrin's gaze turned to the edge of the Angryong Sea. There, the Yeomgolho was submerging below the sea surface. Probably, the resurrected Jinmayeol was inside. Yukrin chuckled. Starting with the Betrayal King Geumwi, the terrifying Muguk Cult and the Demon Sect Leader. And Jinmayeol, who had only thought of stabbing each other in the back from the beginning. After defeating them all, the final victor was Yukrin. However, even though Yukrin had defeated his formidable opponents and obtained the palace of salt crystals he had longed for, his laughter diminished. The chuckling sound soon turned into silence, and only silence lingered in the Angryong Sea, where the overwhelming majority of living beings had died due to the aftermath of the battle. He had won, but Yukrin could not be happy.

‘Yeomhaeguiro-ok... was pushed back.’ It was a blow to Yukrin's pride, who had believed all his life that Yeomhaeguiro-ok was invincible. Grit... After grinding his teeth for a while, Yukrin, holding the palace of salt crystals, headed towards the Dragon Palace. While issuing a return order to Wiyun and organizing various future plans, Yukrin decided on the first thing to do.

‘Refine the palace of Bongrae into a true treasure. After merging it with the domain and turning it into a refined treasure, if I perfect Yeomhaeguiro-ok based on it... I will truly reach the pinnacle.’

However, despite convincing himself, the darkness did not leave Yukrin's face.

Haewang Hall. At its center, Haerin trembled with blood dripping from his eyes. “...Though it was a bit rough, I helped the successor of that person according to your will. This is the best I can do. Now, I will try my best to find a way to survive. Please protect your descendants, Grandfather Haenyeong....”
