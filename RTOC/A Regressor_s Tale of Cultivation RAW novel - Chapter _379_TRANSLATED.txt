### Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 379: Together with Everyone (1)

---

**Sizzle—**

As the power of the Taishan Flame Emperor Technique subsided, the surrounding sea came back into view. It was a direct hit. The creature known as Jinmayeol was obliterated without a trace. However, I couldn't shake off an unpleasant feeling.

‘That bastard….’

He escaped. Although his physical body was destroyed, I could sense that his soul had fled somewhere to be resurrected. Thinking back, it was the same on the first day I arrived in the High Power Realm. After my duel with Kim Younghoon, I used the Taishan Flame Emperor Technique, and all the demonic creatures within its range were annihilated, including Jinmayeol. Yet, he came back to life. He wasn’t like Wonlip, who could resurrect seven times, but he was still a troublesome foe.

**Rumble!**

In the distance, I saw the ship Yeomgolho, carrying Kim Yeon and Bukhyanghwa, submerging back into the depths of the High Power Realm’s sea. A strange sound emanated from the keel of Yeomgolho. It seemed that the precious Yeomjeong, used to construct the keel, was reacting to the Taishan Flame Emperor Technique.

**Whoosh!**

I slashed towards the submerging Yeomgolho, and before it fully submerged, its bow was cleanly cut off.

‘Yeomjeong….’

Yeomjeong was also related to the Taishan Flame Emperor Technique.

‘I had expected this from the moment I saw the character for salt (鹽).’

Yeomjeong was named so because it was white and tasted salty when licked. Essentially, Yeomjeong was a mineral very similar to salt.

‘Is it a warship that can freely dive into the deep sea of the High Power Realm using Yeomjeong…?’

No wonder the Tumah Pirates were so notorious. After watching the Tumah Pirates disappear, I turned my gaze to Kim Yeon and Bukhyanghwa.

“How are they?”

Hongbeom, who had transformed back into his human form, stroked his beard with a gentle expression.

“Fortunately, they have passed the critical stage. Especially, the Conqueror King is fine thanks to the Mystical Ghost King holding onto her soul with his consciousness. Although her soul was injured, it’s not a major issue.”

I approached Bukhyanghwa and Kim Yeon. Kim Yeon, having exhausted her energy, was holding Bukhyanghwa tightly and crying herself to sleep.

“Haha, Kim Yeon won’t let go of the Conqueror King.”

Hongbeom laughed heartily, pointing at the two. I reverted to my human form and smiled at them.

“…Let’s go back.”

Thus, the incident of the cult members being kidnapped by the pirates came to an end. At least, I hoped it would.

After sending the remaining cult members back to the Black Sea Infinite Sect, I looked up at the ‘sky’ with a cold gaze.

“…I can read the celestial signs.”

Indeed, the High Power Realm was a place where the sky didn’t exist, making it impossible to read celestial signs. Yet, for some reason, I could see them now. Celestial signs were essentially the gravitational flows emitted by stars! And I could feel a gravitational flow from the sky directed at me.

‘A calamity.’

It wasn’t a normal celestial sign. A typical celestial sign would allow one to read the future. However, this sign was a single gravitational pull directed at me. It was the celestial sign of misfortune! And suddenly being able to see this ‘single celestial sign’ in a world where celestial signs couldn’t be seen was highly suspicious.

Having experienced numerous misfortunes and disasters, I could tell.

“Someone… has bestowed this upon me…!”

This celestial sign was clearly artificial. As I reached the level of a demonic creature, the types, qualities, and ranges of celestial signs I could see expanded. And among the celestial signs I saw in the Night of the Netherworld, there was no such misfortune. This misfortune must have been ‘bestowed’ upon me after I arrived in the High Power Realm.

‘Thinking back, it was strange.’

How could the first guide I met in the High Power Realm be a fraud, the palace lord I sought for an alliance only think of betraying us, and when I sent my consciousness to the lower realm to build a stronghold, my main body was split in two and faced a true person? Upon returning, my comrades were kidnapped, and one was on the verge of death. Misfortunes had plagued my life more than once, but this time, the frequency was too high. It was clearly bad luck.

I glared at the sky. I couldn’t yet guess who had bestowed this misfortune upon me. However, if someone could bestow fate, they were certainly not a trivial being and likely didn’t harbor goodwill towards me.

‘Of course….’

‘This world is driving me crazy….’

I sighed. But there was nothing I could do now. Misfortune wouldn’t last forever.

‘I’ll wait until the misfortune passes!’

After one last glare at the sky, I returned to the Black Sea. Perhaps due to the many events or the shocking realization, my shoulders felt unnecessarily stiff.

---

After returning to the Black Sea, I received a report from Baekrin, who had regained consciousness the fastest among the four.

“…Thus, we escaped from Yeomgolho and were rescued by the Sect Leader and his party.”

“Thank you for the detailed explanation.”

After receiving the report, I pondered over one thing Baekrin mentioned.

‘Yukyo is a descendant of the Sea Dragon Clan….’

Although Baekrin suggested it might be a lie, I believed it to be true.

‘Considering the reports from Bukhyanghwa, Kim Yeon, and Kim Younghoon, who faced Yukyo’s dragon form, it closely resembled the Sea Dragon Clan except for the color. And… when I asked Seoran why she slept with Yukyo, she mentioned feeling a strange intimacy despite the presence of an aphrodisiac.’

In conclusion, while Yukyo might have deceived Baekrin, the story about the Sea Dragon Clan and her lineage was likely true.

**Boom!**

I expanded the space in the underground of the Infinite Sect and took out the statue of the Sea Dragon Clan I had brought from the deep sea. It appeared dark in the deep sea, but in the dim underground, it shone brightly.

‘Well, it’s a piece of ancient stone.’

I infused spiritual energy and consciousness into the statue to investigate. I even tried infusing the energy of a sage, but the statue showed no reaction. It was simply a statue carved from ancient stone.

After observing the statue for a while, I summoned Seoran and Songjin. They came down to the underground shortly after, and I showed them the statue.

“This is the Sea Dragon statue I found while rescuing Bukhyanghwa and Kim Yeon. Have you seen anything like this before?”

Seoran stared at the statue for a moment before exclaiming.

“Oh, I’ve seen this before!”

“You have?”

“Yes. While reading the history books of the Sea Dragon Palace, I saw an illustration exactly like this. The Sea Dragon Clan, or rather most dragon clans, are descendants of the True Dragon of the Guanghan Realm. According to the history books, one of the True Dragon’s bloodlines mixed with the Black Dragon’s bloodline to create the Black Dragon Clan, and some of the Black Dragon Clan crossed over to the High Power Realm and transformed into the Sea Dragon Clan. The Sea Dragon Clan then spread to numerous lower realms.”

“…!”

I immediately understood the meaning of ‘True Dragon, High Power, and countless lower realms.’

‘The seed of the Sea Dragon born from the True Dragon bloomed in the High Power Realm and spread to countless lower realms.’

But there was something strange.

‘Why is there a blood sound before the True Dragon?’

No matter how I thought about it, blood sound didn’t seem related to the dragon clan. At that moment, Seoran spoke excitedly.

“This is truly… a historical treasure of immense value to the Sea Dragon Clan! To think I would see a treasure mentioned in the history books in real life….”

“What is it?”

“This is the jade seal of the first Sea Dragon King, Ziyin! Even the jade seals used by the Sea Dragon Kings in various realms, including the one held by Grandfather Seohyeol, are mere replicas of this Zihun Jade Seal! Unbelievable!”

Seoran was so excited that she seemed ready to lick the Zihun Jade Seal. Watching her, I asked a question that suddenly came to mind.

“By the way, the first Sea Dragon King wasn’t from the Seo clan?”

“Yes, the first Sea Dragon King used the Zi surname. However, all his descendants, the Sea Dragon Clan, carry his blood, so it doesn’t matter much. The Sea Dragon Clan’s royal authority is determined by whether one inherits the replica of the Zihun Jade Seal, the Haekwon Jade Seal.”

I was startled and looked back and forth between Seoran and the Zihun Jade Seal.

“So, if you have the first Sea Dragon King’s jade seal….”

“Oh, that’s not the case.”

Seoran shook her head with a bitter smile.

“Unfortunately, the only way to become the owner of the jade seal and be recognized as the king is to inherit it directly from the previous owner. The owner of the jade seal can learn the hidden history and purpose of the Sea Dragon Clan, but since I wasn’t recognized by the previous owner, the Zihun Jade Seal is just a historical treasure to me.”

“I see….”

“That’s unfortunate….”

Songjin and I sighed almost simultaneously.

‘If Seoran became the Sea Dragon King, she might have influenced the Sea Dragon Clan, which was being consumed by Seohyeol’s Takhonmangcheon.’

We might have even discovered why Seohyeol continued to take the form of a Sea Dragon.

“May I study it a bit more…?”

“Sure, go ahead. And about Yukyo….”

I informed Seoran of the report I received from Baekrin.

“So Yukyo might be a descendant of the Sea Dragon Clan.”

“Yes. So when she wakes up, ask her about it.”

“Understood.”

“Wait, Seoran.”

At that moment, Songjin asked Seoran with a puzzled expression.

“Isn’t Yukyo a fraud? Didn’t the Sect Leader hear from Baekrin that she deceived him until the end? Can we get a proper answer from her?”

“Oh, it’s fine. We can interrogate her with Siho.”

“Because she’s afraid of Siho?”

“Well, that’s part of it….”

Songjin was slightly surprised by Seoran’s next words.

“Siho is also a martial artist of the Five Great Clans. She can discern lies through her consciousness, so Yukyo won’t be able to lie.”

“That fox!? Since when?”

I chuckled at Songjin’s reaction.

“Didn’t you know? Even Seoran knew.”

“Ah… I’m sorry, I didn’t know.”

Siho, amusingly, had learned martial arts after being beaten by Kim Younghoon and had risen to the Five Great Clans. The combination of the fox clan and the Five Great Clans was a good match, so Siho’s power must have increased significantly.

“Well, if she can discern truth from lies, that’s good. Let’s go.”

“Yes, Master. Sect Leader, we’ll take our leave.”

“Go ahead.”

Seoran and Songjin left with the Sea Dragon statue, the Zihun Jade Seal. I restored the space to its original state and fell into thought.

‘The term Hyuneumjigye at the end.’

It was undoubtedly the name of the Black Dragon King, Hyuneum.

‘Hyuneum, Ziyin.’

And Xueyin (Blood Sound). Anyone with a brain could see that the three were related somehow. Various wild imaginations crossed my mind, but they were all just fantasies without any solid basis.

What was the relationship between Xueyin, Hyuneum, and Ziyin? What was Seohyeol’s true nature? I was lost in complex thoughts but shook my head to clear them.

‘Enough. There’s nothing I can do now.’

This world was filled with treacherous traps and hidden calamities. However, one of the few advantages of this world was that one could continuously grow stronger.

‘Let’s elevate my realm.’

I would continue to build my stronghold and grow. I recalled the words of the Ghost Army. Only greater strength could overcome fate, he said.

‘Gaining greater strength and status will help me uncover Seohyeol’s secrets.’

I created a clone using the Zuatallipmang technique and lay down on the altar, extending my consciousness into the Biseonjin. Building my stronghold as quickly as possible was urgent.

---

While my main body focused on building the stronghold, my Zuatallipmang clone headed to the Infinite Sect’s Poison Study Hall. Most of the Infinite Sect’s members were spiritual beings, so there was little need for a medical hall. Thus, Bukhyanghwa and the others were being treated in the Poison Study Hall, where Hongbeom researched poisons. Poisons could be used as medicine with the right proportions.

Entering the room where Bukhyanghwa was resting, I saw Kim Yeon dozing off while nursing her.

‘They’ve grown quite close.’

When they first met, they were ready to tear each other apart. But now, even while sleeping, they held hands. I brought a blanket and covered the sleeping Kim Yeon, then checked Bukhyanghwa’s condition. Thanks to the medicine Hongbeom had given her, her soul had significantly recovered. After infusing some energy into both of them, I quietly left the room.

Outside, Kim Younghoon was waiting with his arms crossed.

“What brings you here?”

“I have something to tell you.”

“Perfect timing. I have a question too.”

“What is it?”

I asked Kim Younghoon about the task I received from Jangik.

“If you had to cut something that couldn’t be cut, what would you do?”

“Something that can’t be cut… like what?”

“For example, a planet.”

After thinking for a moment, Kim Younghoon replied.

“I can’t cut a planet, but I can cut something similar.”

“What?”

He grinned.

“Well… I’ll explain later. By the way, how do you feel after seeing that pirate? Do you have a better understanding of martial arts?”
