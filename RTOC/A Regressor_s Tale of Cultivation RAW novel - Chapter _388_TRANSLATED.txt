**Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 388: Salt (4)**

“What…!” 

Before I could even react to the familiar name of the technique, something unpleasant burrowed into my body. Gurgle, gurgle! Soon, I felt all the colors before my eyes change to purple. Hehehe…. An eerie laughter echoed in my ears. Twitch, twitch…. I sensed a nauseating phantom fragrance that seemed to pierce my nose. Before my eyes, I saw a swirling chaos that I had seen somewhere before. The endlessly mixing and evolving double helix of the Taiji turned purple and entered my mental world. And then, the figure of Liulin appeared. He wore a fishy smile, a victorious expression on his face.

‘…This is.’

I frowned as I observed the insidious technique called ‘Purple Soul Fills the Sky’ trying to take over my body and mind. It was a terrifying technique at first glance. Even I, who had been taught by Qingwenling and could use any cultivation language, found it hard to follow the changes of this technique with my eyes. I could barely guess its characteristics.

‘A technique that seizes the opponent’s body, disassembles their memories, soul, abilities, and bloodline, and absorbs only the advantageous parts while automatically expelling the parts it cannot handle…? In theory, as long as one’s soul can endure, it’s a technique that can endlessly evolve into a perfect being….’

However, that was all.

‘Compared to the ‘Muddy Soul Fills the Sky’ that bore the name of an immortal technique….’

It seemed pathetically lukewarm. Muddy Soul Fills the Sky was so insidious and fast that the opponent wouldn’t even notice they were infected. In contrast, Purple Soul Fills the Sky was so slow in its erosion that it made one yawn. Comparing it to Seohul’s immortal technique was an insult to Seohul, showing a stark difference in completion.

However, I smiled faintly. One thing was certain. It was clear. I smirked as I looked at Liulin, who was laughing cluelessly in my mental world. Liulin seemed pleased to take over my body, but he was wrong. Instead, I had grasped a clue about Muddy Soul Fills the Sky from Liulin.

I moved my mental world. In Penglai Island, I couldn’t use qi or other mystical powers. I couldn’t even use my consciousness, but my mental world was my own, so it didn’t matter. The next moment, I invited Liulin’s mind into my mental world. Since reaching the state of ‘sitting and forgetting,’ it was possible not only to read the opponent’s mental world but also to invite someone with whom I had a close mental exchange into my mental world.

And the next moment. I felt Liulin’s entire body being torn apart and screaming in pain in my sword mountain. However, as if he hadn’t won the title of Dragon King in a gamble, Liulin gritted his teeth and glared at me. I clasped my hands behind my back, turned around, and slowly climbed the mountain. Thud, thud! Swords pierced my entire body as well, but I paid no mind and climbed the mountain calmly and leisurely.

* * *

Liulin’s pupils trembled wildly. At first, he thought it was just a glass sword mountain. But he felt it. The more he raised Purple Soul Fills the Sky, the more he climbed the sword mountain, the essence of this mental world flowed closely into his mind. As the world’s form peeled away due to Purple Soul Fills the Sky, the ‘true nature’ of Seoeunhyun’s mental world was imprinted in Liulin’s mind.

Fwoosh— Flames flickered everywhere. The smell of sulfur filled the air, and the sky was covered in black smoke. He gritted his teeth and panted in the acrid air. Drip… drip…. Blood dripped from his entire body. He trembled and took a step forward. Thud! His entire body was pierced by swords. Liulin gritted his teeth and looked at the figure climbing the mountain above. Drip… splat, splat…. Blood flowed from that figure. And the blood flowed down the mountain, soaking the sword-covered ground where Liulin stood. Liulin trembled and looked down at the swords beneath him. Countless corpses lay there. They were all the corpses of one person. The Demon Sect Leader, Seoeunhyun. All the corpses of Seoeunhyun had died with painful and resentful expressions. Liulin trembled in fear. What lay beneath his feet were undoubtedly Seoeunhyuns. He felt it. Since Purple Soul Fills the Sky was a technique that could disassemble the opponent’s memories and history, it was excellent at revealing the opponent’s essence. He could clearly feel it. The countless ‘Seoeunhyuns’ lying on the ground were the ‘real’ Seoeunhyun.

But if that was the case, why were the ‘real’ ones dead and scattered on the ground, and what was the ‘thing’ climbing the mountain now? That ‘thing’ emitted a faint light, making it look like a small light cluster climbing the dark sword mountain. Liulin’s eyes burned. He endured the swords piercing his entire body and chased after the ‘thing’ ahead. And at some point, the shape of the ‘thing’ came into clear view in Liulin’s sight. The thing he thought was wrapped in light. It was a human-shaped charcoal. Sizzle— It was burning in the embers, shedding ash and charcoal dust from its body, yet its face wore a peaceful, eerie smile. Yes, that thing was a ghost.

Liulin gasped for breath. Through his exchanges with Jinmayeol of the Tumah Pirates, he had learned about the mental world. And he knew that the mental world revealed the essence of its owner without any filter. If so, what was that thing climbing the mountain with a body reduced to charcoal, pierced by swords? That thing was a dead person. At the same time, it was a monster. It was even more insane than Liulin, who considered himself a greedy monster. Liulin thought.

‘I must… kill the Demon Sect Leader. No, I must seal him.’

He instinctively knew. Although he pretended to be quite human on the outside, this charcoal monster was the most dangerous being in the current high power realm. He felt a pain that seemed to tear his mind apart with every step he took on the sword mountain, even as the Dragon King of the combined technique. However, Liulin gritted his teeth and followed the charcoal monster.

‘I must eliminate that thing. I must eliminate it!’

From his intuition, an unprecedented, terrifying fear surged. That thing must be stopped. If not, only death awaited! And finally, as he half-lost his mind from the pain, Liulin caught up with the charcoal and reached out his hand. And he realized he was wrong. It was when his fingertips brushed the charcoal’s body. Liulin screamed in agony as his entire body burned. The pain was unending! The embers from the charcoal did not transfer to him. It was as if the fire was meant solely to burn the charcoal. However, Liulin simultaneously knew. If he disassembled Seoeunhyun and absorbed him with Purple Soul Fills the Sky, that fire would also transfer to him. As he entered this world to devour Seoeunhyun and finally touched the hot charcoal, he was sharing the pain with him. He finally realized. The charcoal turned to look at him. He instinctively knew. This charcoal was not a mere human. No, it wasn’t even a typical mortal! If it had been given the fate of mortality like him, it couldn’t have endured such pain with a sane mind!

The charcoal looked at Liulin, and at first, Liulin, who had intended to disassemble and absorb the charcoal with Purple Soul Fills the Sky, stepped back. Liulin forgot about the swords piercing his entire body and started to run away from the charcoal. It was painful. The problem wasn’t being pierced by swords, but the burning pain he felt after touching the charcoal seemed to sear his soul itself. No, it was more painful than any fire-based sorcery he had ever encountered in his life! He had to get away! If he got away from that monster, the pain would disappear! He ran down the mountain. Half-crazed with pain, Liulin descended to the bottom of the mountain. As he reached the bottom, he seemed to see the edge of this mental world. He rolled his eyes and threw himself out of the mental world.

And then. Splat! The corpses of Seoeunhyun, which had been pierced by swords at the bottom of the mountain, all rose simultaneously and grabbed Liulin. Liulin screamed as he saw the corpses with blood-red eyes. Liulin looked back. He was coming down. The charcoal monster was descending the sword mountain and approaching him. However, even as he tried to shake off the corpses’ hands with the technique of Purple Soul Fills the Sky, the corpses did not let go of him.

-Agakryeokryeokmanmaneun….
-Swaeswaeseongseonggigigeupgeupi….
-Pyeongpyeongsaengsaenggeomgeomeuljapjapaonon….
-Jeoljeoldaeanannochijianan….

It was literally a hellscape! Liulin struggled in pain, gritting his teeth and exploding his mental body. To escape, this was the only way! Boom! His mental body exploded, and eventually, Seoeunhyun’s hands had no choice but to let go of Liulin. The charcoal monster merely watched the scene quietly.

* * *

I opened my eyes. Returning to reality, I saw Liulin clutching his head and gasping for breath. “Purple Soul Fills the Sky… Thank you. Thanks to you, I’ve obtained an interesting technique.” Thanks to him self-destructing his mental body to escape from my mental world, I was able to obtain the incantation of Purple Soul Fills the Sky from the fragments of his mental body. I could examine it calmly later. He looked up at me, gritting his teeth. “What… are you?” “Hmm?” “How… charcoal… charcoal… that, that hot… argh!” Liulin seemed to have seen something in my mental world, groaning in pain with a frown. ‘Did he touch the karmic fire for a moment?’ I didn’t understand what he meant by charcoal. It seemed he was in so much pain that he was seeing illusions. “You’re quite the whiner.” I chuckled and kicked Liulin. Recently, the karmic fire had been losing its momentum and was about to extinguish. Only a few embers remained, yet he was whining so much from just touching those embers. ‘Since it’s a fire that only burns me, it wouldn’t transfer unless it completely consumed me.’ However, he still couldn’t seem to shake off the shock from the pain of the karmic fire, trembling uncontrollably. Wearing the jade seal and crown, I approached Liulin and stepped on his neck. “Purple Soul Fills the Sky… It was quite an impressive technique, but it seems trivial compared to the superior version I’ve seen.” I questioned Liulin, who was trembling in pain. “So, what is your true purpose? Tell me your true purpose.” Liulin, who had been trembling in pain and coughing, started to laugh. “Ha, hahaha… Ahahaha…! Purpose…?” “…” As I looked into his mental world and tried to guess his purpose, I shuddered. Buzz— My energy was returning to my body. No, to be precise, my body ‘outside’ this formation was connected to my ‘main body’! Crackle— As if the purpose of the formation had been fulfilled since I inherited the throne, those who had lost their memories were starting to regain them one by one, and at the same time, they seemed to be recovering their powers like me. And I stepped harder on Liulin’s neck. He was up to something! “What… are you plotting?” “Your question… is wrong… you monster.” He looked up at me with a fishy smile, enduring the pain. “It has already begun!”

Angry Dragon Sea. Right below the sky where all light had disappeared, Weiyun was forming a seal with her hands, emitting a dark red demonic aura. She formed a water seal and reached out to the sky. And at some point. Rumble! A massive formation seemed to unfold in the void, and above the center of the Angry Dragon Sea, the illusion of Angry Dragon Island appeared. The deep-sea island hidden beneath the True Dragon Island. And at the center of that illusion, the image of a giant sea dragon rose. Using Weiyun and the Angry Dragon Sea itself as a medium, the sea dragon’s illusion transmitted its power and revealed its projection there. Rumble! The sea dragon flew past Weiyun, who was half-crazed from the demonic aura, and quickly stopped at a spot in the Angry Dragon Sea. A corner of the sea where the ocean was split. The sea dragon’s projection rose above it. The current True Dragon Princess, who had taken over the body of the former Angry Dragon Palace Lord, Liuweng. Liulin’s main body began to exert its power. Rumble! As he clenched his hand, the split deep sea of the high power realm began to ‘close’ very slowly. Liulin, at the bottom of the split sea, communicated with his clone on Penglai Island and his eyes gleamed. Liulin’s eyes split vertically as he looked down at Penglai Island below. It was nearing morning, and light was gradually returning to the world. Penglai Island was shining brightly as the formation activated, and the palace made of salt, ‘Salt Palace,’ built at the top of Salt Mountain in the center of Penglai Island, was shining brightly. Liulin’s main body’s power was directed towards the palace made of salt. Crackle! The palace connected to Salt Mountain began to be uprooted.
