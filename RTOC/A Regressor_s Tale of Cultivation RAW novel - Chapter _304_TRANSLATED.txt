Kang Minhee paused for a moment after hearing those words. I cautiously observed the thoughts of the two people. Kim Yeon was filled with emotions of embarrassment, guilt, and worry. And Kang Minhee...

"Hoo..."

She leaned back against the chair. Then, she suddenly started to smile contentedly.

"Ah... really... I finally feel relieved."

"Are you okay?" Kim Yeon asked, her complexion turning pale.

Kang Minhee smiled broadly and said, "Yes, I'm fine, Yeon. Didn't I tell you? We were just dating for fun, and we didn't have any real feelings for each other. Haven't you noticed how I've been supporting you two from behind since we were at the company?"

"Uh... but..."

"How did that idiot even realize your feelings? That's what I'm more curious about. Do you know how frustrated I was when I was at the company? It felt like I had swallowed ten sweet potatoes at once. Now it feels like they're finally going down. It's like food that wouldn't digest before is finally being digested."

"Unni..."

As Kang Minhee continued to speak, Kim Yeon's thoughts grew more complicated.

"I said I'm fine! Really... I've already made a lot of friends here, and I'm always surrounded by people, so I'm not lonely. I told you from the beginning, I'm not destined to date men."

"..."

"So... congratulations, Yeon. And if that idiot ever makes things hard for you or does something stupid, tell me. I'll refine him into a ghost king for you to command easily."

"Oh, that's okay. I can make puppets too..."

"Hahaha! That's awesome!"

I desperately controlled my thoughts between the two, making sure they didn't flow. How long did they laugh and chat? As dawn approached, both of them sighed.

"We have to part soon."

"Yes, it's a shame. Let's meet again when we have time."

"When can we meet next time?"

"Well, it might be difficult if it's not this day again. I have to train in the side path most of the time. So, I'll probably stay in the Black Ghost Bone Valley for about a year or two, then go back to the side path."

"Isn't the side path hard?"

"It's not that hard. I have a lot of friends there. You'd be surprised if you knew."

"Then... that's a bit of a relief."

"See? There's nothing to worry about."

However, Kim Yeon couldn't erase the worry from her thoughts as she looked at Kang Minhee.

"Unni, it's time to go... Can I say one last thing?"

"Hmm? What is it?"

"If you still have feelings for Eunhyun oppa, I can give up. Everyone knows you two were close at the company. So... please tell me."

'She thinks I was close with him?'

"I was close with him???" Kang Minhee asked back, incredulous. It seemed Yeon was misunderstanding something. We were rivals, which meant we couldn't just hate each other personally. Publicly, we growled at each other, and privately, we bickered a lot. How could she think that about our relationship?

"I always fought with him whenever we met."

"Really? To me, it looked more like childhood friends playing pranks on each other."

"Maybe it's because I only told you about our playful dating stories?"

"Unni, if you have feelings, please tell me."

"..."

Kang Minhee frowned, seemingly annoyed.

"Hey, Kim Yeon. Why are you doing this? I don't have feelings for him. It was a joke. We both didn't take it seriously, so why are you making a fuss? Stop it. I'm seriously supporting you two, so don't worry."

The thought of sincerely supporting them was true. However, Kim Yeon suppressed her regretful thoughts.

"...Yes. I understand."

"Yeah, I've been congratulating you since earlier, so why do you keep doing this... By the way, didn't you say you had a favor to ask?"

By then, the sun had fully risen, and the yin energy of Haneumtaek had subsided. Kim Yeon told Kang Minhee about Jeon Myunghoon and the disciples of Geumshinchunraemun who had gone to the Ghost Realm. Kang Minhee exclaimed in surprise after hearing the story.

"Jeon Myunghoon... he grew so much besides just being a flirt... Well, it's been almost 100 years, so if he was still the same, he'd just be an idiot."

"..."

"Anyway, you want me to let Jeon Myunghoon use the side path?"

"Yes."

"Hmm, well... it's possible. But, he won't flirt with me again, right?"

"Probably... not. Former Manager... has matured a lot."

"Yeah... he should have matured sooner."

Kang Minhee clicked her tongue and nodded.

"Alright, I'll let him use it. But."

She spoke with a serious expression.

"To enter the side path, he must follow my words, and he must not refuse my words no matter what. Also, if Jeon Myunghoon is a Celestial Qi practitioner, only him?"

"Yes. According to Eunhyun oppa, he might become a Demonic Qi practitioner if given time."

"Hmm, then it won't work. If you, Eunhyun, or any other companions accompany him, I can't allow it. The last time the people of Geumshinchunraemun passed through the side path, the highest level was Origin Qi, and most were at the Decision Qi level, so I allowed them to go together. But if a Celestial Qi practitioner on the verge of becoming a Demonic Qi practitioner goes, his soul is too large, and the side path might collapse if many go together."

"Ah... I understand. I'll tell him."

'Hmm, this is unfortunate.'

I felt regret knowing I couldn't accompany Jeon Myunghoon. I was also attached to the disciples of Geumshinchunraemun and curious about the secrets of the Ghost Realm.

'It was an opportunity to build the axis of longevity. I'll have to wait for the next chance.'

It was also unfortunate for Jeon Myunghoon.

'If only I could take Yeonjin with me, I could get advice from Yeonwi...'

Yeonwi, who had experience in the Ghost Realm, could have been a great help to Jeon Myunghoon.

* * *

I nodded.

"Given the situation, I should ask Yeonwi directly."

I conveyed the conversation to Seorip and headed to the Thunder Spirit Road from the Celestial Path. On the Thunder Spirit Road, above the remnants of Geumshinchunraemun, Jeon Myunghoon was floating, looking at the scenery, and Yeonjin was diligently training on a nearby peak.

"Jeon Myunghoon, Yeonjin. Come here. I have something to discuss."

"What is it?"

"If you're going to the Ghost Realm, it's best to ask Yeonwi, who has experience there. Yeonjin, can you contact Yeonwi?"

"Yes! I'll contact him!"

After a while, Yeonjin, who seemed to be communicating with something while sitting, opened his eyes. His entire body seemed to twitch. It was Yeonwi.

"It's been a while since you called. Do you have something to ask this old man?"

"Well, I wanted to ask about the Ghost Realm and also check on how you're doing."

"I'm doing very well. Recently, I've taken in some cute disciples and am enjoying their company. I'm also planning to conquer the Water Realm... I have a lot to do, so it's great."

After talking about how well he was doing for a while, Yeonwi asked back.

"By the way, you wanted to ask about the Ghost Realm?"

"Yes. Do you know anything about the Ghost Realm?"

"The Ghost Realm... it was a gloomy place. And a prosperous one."

For a while, information about the Ghost Realm flowed from Yeonwi's mouth. Jeon Myunghoon and I absorbed the information about the Ghost Realm into our minds. After finishing his explanation, Yeonwi added a word.

"By the way, this information is from about 43,000 years ago, so it might be inaccurate. Keep that in mind."

"Got it. That's enough. By the way, I have one more question."

"What is it?"

I asked with a serious face.

"The weakness of Hyeonwon."

"Oh?"

From the beginning of this life, I had to struggle with a chase from Hyeonwon. If I had been caught, it would have been the next life immediately, so I had to give it my all. But if I knew Hyeonwon's weakness from the start, it wouldn't be a problem.

Yeonwi seemed to think for a moment.

"Weakness... Originally, that guy had no weaknesses. In fact, as long as he's in the Geon-Gon Middle Realm, he has no weaknesses. He's practically invincible within the same realm."

"...!"

I couldn't help but gasp at those words.

"Is that possible?"

That meant to deal with Hyeonwon, I had to face him outside the Geon-Gon Middle Realm.

"Didn't you inflict a fatal wound on him by exploiting his weakness, which is why he's trapped in the Geon-Gon Middle Realm?"

"Weakness... I knew his Taesan Yeolje Gong well, so I fought well. The sacred object I 'borrowed' from the Yin Soul Ghost Gate also played a part. I sacrificed the sacred object of the Yin Soul Ghost Gate and cut one of my axes to inflict a fatal wound on him. He had no weaknesses."

"...You sacrificed a borrowed sacred object?"

"I secretly borrowed it, so it's fine."

"..."

'...If you secretly borrowed it, isn't that 'stealing'?'

I suddenly had a question and asked.

"By the way, you said you knew Taesan Yeolje Gong well. Did you learn it while fighting Hyeonwon?"

"No, I heard it directly from him."

"Huh?"

"Do you think we were destined to be enemies from the start and growled at each other every time we met? We were quite close until that day 43,000 years ago. We were inseparable."

"What kind of relationship did you have?"

"We were betrothed."

"...???"

I couldn't hide my shock at Yeonwi's words.

"About 43,000 years ago, I decided to marry the Lord of Bongrae Palace to elevate the status of Geumshinchunraemun. Hyeonwon also agreed. We joined forces and drove the Black Dragon King to the brink of death. In exchange for sparing his life, he allied with us and joined the human race, for which the Human Race Federation was immensely grateful to us. Haha..."

"..."

I couldn't close my mouth in shock at the surprising revelation.

* * *

'The main body is hearing an incredible story.'

I felt a headache from the sudden influx of information. Before I knew it, Kang Minhee and Kim Yeon hugged each other once and parted. Kim Yeon flew away, wrapped in a pale pink light, and as the sun fully rose, only Kang Minhee and I were left in Haneumtaek.

"It was hard to understand, right? We kept talking in alien language."

"Haha, no. It was an honor."

"Really? I guess so... By the way, Seorip."

"Yes."

Kang Minhee turned to me and said.

"Isn't it time to reveal your identity?"

"...Yes?"

"The way you comb and massage shoulders... I only taught that to that guy when we dated for three weeks. But you do it perfectly, which is strange. From the first time I saw you, you covered your face, and I thought it was strange that I couldn't see your soul due to death."

Wooong—

Kang Minhee's left hand turned into a black ghost claw.

"It's you, right? You're really persistent. How did you think of following me here? Well, I expected it..."

She smiled slyly and said.

"It won't be like on Earth. Today, you'll die here."

Voom!

She swung the ghost claw at me.

"Die, you bastard."
