The Demonic Sect (4)

Crack! Crackle!

Jingui Shi gritted his teeth as he continued to strike the Celestial Tribulation Barrier. 

“Damn it…!”

By now, his body was buzzing with the thunderbolts sent by Liugui King Jeon Myeonghun, making it difficult for him to move. To make matters worse, he could sense that the massive Celestial Sky Diagram was starting to move again.

Vroom—

The Celestial Sky Diagram emitted a sacred light. Gradually, it began to advance. 

Jeon Myeonghun hid inside the Celestial Tribulation Barrier and laughed.

Vroom—

The Celestial Sky Diagram started to accelerate. Despite his battered body and coughing up blood, Jingui Shi smirked. However, Jeon Myeonghun, inside the barrier, merely wore a nonchalant expression.

“Hmm, moving 200,000 li at a time is indeed a bit risky.”

Crack! Crackle!

He glanced at Oh Hyeonseok, who was overcoming the Celestial Tribulation.

“Anyway, Hyeonseok hyung will soon finish the Celestial Tribulation, so the barrier can't be maintained indefinitely…”

It didn’t matter.

Vroom— Vroom— Vroom—

The Celestial Sky Diagram accelerated tenfold as it moved forward. It continued to speed up until, at some point, it used the Shrinking Earth Technique to traverse hundreds of thousands of li in an instant. This was the nature of the Celestial Shrinking Earth Technique. 

And this technique had a unique feature.

Flash!

Every time the Shrinking Earth Technique was used seven times, the distortion of the space it could traverse increased, doubling the distance covered in one leap, just like the tenfold acceleration of the Celestial Sky Diagram.

‘We just covered 200,000 li, so now it’s 400,000 li.’

Jeon Myeonghun clicked his tongue inwardly.

‘This world’s units of distance are truly dizzying.’

* * *

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The Light and Sound Region activated the Celestial Shrinking Earth Technique again towards its second destination.

Flash!

“Second destination, arrived.”

After praising the formation masters, I extended my consciousness to survey the surroundings of the Light and Sound Region.

The first leap was 200,000 li. The next was 400,000 li.

‘A total of 600,000 li. Not bad.’

The Celestial Shrinking Earth Technique doubles the distance traveled with each leap, and it can be used a total of seven times. Since the initial distance was 200,000 li, the total distance that can be covered is…

‘25 million li.’

It was a mind-boggling number, but it was possible.

‘This is the ability when human malice is converted into movement capability…’

It was truly an insane distance.

‘Even though 400,000 li isn’t a long distance for the combined forces, as days pass and the distance doubles, it will become increasingly difficult to catch up.’

Crack! Crackle!

Moreover, the Celestial Tribulation falling from the sky gradually weakened and then disappeared altogether. 

And where Oh Hyeonseok stood, an eight-winged giant of starlight appeared.

Rumble!

Oh Hyeonseok’s perfected Celestial Star Radiance Technique was slightly different from mine and Changhoja’s. While starlight flashed within us, Oh Hyeonseok’s body emitted a mysterious purple cloud along with the starlight. It seemed to be part of his ability.

‘Well, it’s fine. With this…’

All four guardians of the Demonic Sect now possessed at least the combat power of the Four Destruction Stage. Jeon Myeonghun, Hongbeom, and Oh Hyeonseok had all reached the Four Destruction Stage, and the only one who hadn’t, Kim Yeon, was the second-in-command of the puppets, which were the foundation of the Demonic Sect. She could mobilize the entire sect at any time, so her own cultivation level didn’t matter.

‘And in addition to that…’

“…”

Yuhye, standing in front of my seat, blushed slightly.

“…I thought it was undoubtedly a demonic sect. But looking around, I see that the welfare is well-established, and it’s a religious group that pursues peace.”

“…? Isn’t the death within the cult leader’s heart showing on the outside?”

I had nothing to say and could only smack my lips.

“Hmm, I’m just conveying the cult leader’s words to the palace. It’s up to the palace to decide. Even if I speak well of the Demonic Sect, a subjugation order might still be issued.”

Yuhye, who had been very afraid of me, finally understood us after looking around the Demonic Sect, meeting Baeklin, Wishihon, and Eumwa again. Although she still flinched every time she saw me because of my death aura, it was an instinctive reaction, so I couldn’t blame her.

In the end, Yuhye was moved by my sincere persuasion and promised to convey our intentions to the Black Ghost Palace.

“It’s fine. If I receive the ‘procedure,’ won’t I have to modify my current ghost body?”

“This ghost body was created by my superior, Chajo Ghost, so no modification is necessary.”

Since she didn’t want it, I had no intention of forcing her. She mentioned Chajo Ghost and then seemed to remember something.

“By the way, could you give me a communication talisman to contact Chajo Ghost? I need to tell him not to worry about me.”

However, Hongbeom shook his head at her request.

“You seem to want to use a communication talisman, but it will be difficult. We will be traversing hundreds of thousands, even millions of li in the coming days, and the spatial and celestial energy distortions will make it unlikely for the communication talisman to transmit properly.”

“Hmm, is it really that difficult? If I send about a hundred talismans, won’t at least one reach?”

“It’s not a matter of probability. The celestial energy distortions could alter the content of the message during transmission.”

Yuhye pondered for a moment before speaking.

“I’ll take that risk. Even if the message is altered, it’s better to inform Chajo Ghost of my safety.”

“If that’s what you want…”

Hongbeom reluctantly took out a communication talisman from his storage and handed it to her.

“Thank you, Guardian.”

“You’re welcome.”

“I’ll go to my room to send the communication talisman, Cult Leader.”

Yuhye blushed slightly and went up to the room assigned to her. I chuckled as I watched her leave.

* * *

Yuhye returned to her room and unfolded the communication talisman she received from Hongbeom.

“Chajo Ghost, are you well? It’s Yuhye. I’m currently at the headquarters of the Demonic Sect. I’m sending this communication talisman to tell you not to worry too much.”

She cleared her throat and recorded her voice on the talisman. Then, she began to convey the situation here.

“…I thought it would be like hell, but surprisingly, the cult leader is a benevolent ghost.”

Starting with the cult leader, Muguk Ghost King Seo Eunhyun, and the purpose of the Demonic Sect as she heard from him.

“Their goal is to create a peaceful ghost realm. It’s a grand dream. As an outsider, I don’t know their ultimate goal, but they said they would release me later. So, you don’t need to come looking for me. I’ll return to the Black Ghost Palace myself.”

Worried that her superior and lover, Chajo Ghost, might come chasing after her, Yuhye made a request.

“And it would be better if the Black Ghost Palace didn’t consider the Demonic Sect as an enemy. I’ll explain in detail when I return.”

Yuhye considered the relationship between the Black Ghost Palace and the Demonic Sect.

“Also, your friend Baeklin seems to have calmed down after witnessing the true love of the guardian couple, Wishihon and Eumwa. He seemed a bit down, but he wasn’t as angry as before. We might have misunderstood this sect too much.”

She also conveyed the reason Chajo Ghost had joined the battle, his friend Baeklin’s situation.

“…I don’t think I’ll easily forget what I’ve seen here.”

Yuhye recalled her time in the Demonic Sect. Initially, she was scared, but the cult leader turned out to be kind and upright. The ghosts in the Light and Sound Region were filled with happiness, leisure, and peace. Yuhye felt she might never forget the peaceful scenes of the Light and Sound Region.

“And also… I left a message as if it were my last words before being taken away… It’s a bit embarrassing. I was happy to serve you, but please forget the tone that sounded like a farewell. I’d appreciate it if you could bury it in your memory forever.”

She blushed, remembering how she had left a heartfelt message to Chajo Ghost before being taken away by Jeon Myeonghun. She felt like diving into her bed and kicking the blankets in embarrassment.

“Well, I think you’ll know I’m safe now. I’m really fine. I’m not brainwashed into saying good things about this place. Oh, and…”

Vroom—

She looked out the window at the trembling Light and Sound Region.

‘Are we leaving soon?’

If so, it was time to send the communication talisman.

“They said we’re leaving soon. I’ll end it here. I hope the message isn’t too distorted. Goodbye, I’ll return soon.”

Yuhye went outside the Demonic Sect’s headquarters and infused the communication talisman with her ghostly power. Hongbeom, who approached her, asked worriedly.

“I’ll remind you again, the spatial waves haven’t settled, so the message might be distorted. Some parts of the voice might be lost, or static might be mixed in.”

“It’s fine. My superior will understand my message no matter how it’s delivered. He’ll figure it out even if it’s distorted.”

“If that’s the case…”

Flash!

Soon, the communication talisman in Yuhye’s hand turned into a beam of light and flew somewhere.

* * *

At the location of the White Sound Region, a ship was flying rapidly.

In the captain’s cabin of the ship, the crew was encouraging Chajo Ghost, who seemed almost out of his mind.

“Don’t worry, Captain. The lieutenant will be safe.”

“With her personality, she might be scolding the demonic cult leaders right now.”

“Besides, they’re on the run. How could they have the leisure to harm the lieutenant? If we catch the demonic sect quickly, the lieutenant will return safely!”

Chajo Ghost smiled faintly at the crew’s encouragement.

“…Thank you, everyone… I’ve shown you a disgraceful side as a captain…”

At that moment.

Flash!

A clear light entered the captain’s cabin.

“That, that’s…!?”

“A communication talisman!?”

Chajo Ghost was startled and reached for the talisman. A gentle voice emanated from it.

―Chajo Ghost….

It was Yuhye’s voice. Chajo Ghost’s eyes widened, and the crew fell silent.

Crackle, crackle—

There was a lot of static, but Chajo Ghost swallowed hard and trembled as he listened.

“Y-Yuhye…! Are you okay? Answer me…!”

Crackle, crackle—

Despite the static, Yuhye’s voice reached Chajo Ghost through the talisman.

―Crackle… Here… Crackle… Worry… Hell… Crackle….

“Y-Yuhye….”

―Cult leader… Crackle… A grand… Don’t come… Love… Won’t forget….

“…”

―Forever… Crackle… Brainwash… Leaving soon… Goodbye… Crackle….

Crackle, crackle—

With that, the communication talisman went silent. 

In the captain’s cabin of the 30th ship, a tremendous wave of ghostly power began to surge.

Rumble!

With blood-red tears streaming from his eyes, Chajo Ghost gritted his teeth.

* * *

Seven days passed.

Rumble—

Finally, the Demonic Sect and the Light and Sound Region traversed the insane distance of 25 million li, reaching the northern end of the Ghost Realm, at the border between the An and Nan regions.

“It’s almost time.”

I smiled as I sat on the cult leader’s seat. Jeon Myeonghun nodded beside me.

“Yes, it’s almost time.”

Soon, we would be able to rescue the remaining disciples of the Golden God Thunder Sect.

Rumble—

The Light and Sound Region moved through the sky. Although the Celestial Shrinking Earth Technique could no longer be used, the Light and Sound Region’s ley lines allowed it to move normally.

After a while, we entered the area where the remains of those who had gone berserk after being possessed by the Celestial Spirit were located.

Step, step….

I flew up into the sky above the Demonic Sect and gasped at the sight in the distance.

“That is… the fate of those who died after being possessed by the Celestial Spirit.”
