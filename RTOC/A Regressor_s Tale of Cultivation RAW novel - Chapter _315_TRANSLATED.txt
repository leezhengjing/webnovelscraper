After carefully examining the movements of the dragon depicted on the Tanghua Dao, I exited the top floor. The ancient palace primarily contained water-attribute techniques, among which the 'Salt Sea Returning Dew Jade' technique was so powerful that it even made my heart tremble. However, mastering it required either drinking seawater or having access to water and salt, making it impossible to learn at the moment. Thus, I simply stored it in the Dimensional Pouch. Although a few other water-attribute techniques caught my eye, none were particularly noteworthy.

Leaving the ancient palace, I picked the Hailan Fruit I had noticed earlier and stored it before heading swiftly to the Inje Dan territory, where I was to rendezvous with the Black Scale Spirit Sect. The surrounding heat was intense, so I transformed into a Ghost King to cool my body as I flew. The Inje Dan territory was as vast as the Haeje Dan territory, with spiritual energy waves emanating from the houses and stone buildings, indicating that there was still much to explore.

Upon reaching the rendezvous point with the Black Scale Spirit Sect, I found them waiting quietly, having gathered everything they could. 

"Haha, it seems everyone's Dimensional Pouches are quite full now. To obtain what we desire on the third floor, we need to make some space," said Xian Gui with a smile, leading us forward. 

As we reached a narrow path engulfed in crimson flames, Xian Gui frowned while peering into it. Having experience in tracking people, I understood why. 

'Someone has already passed through here. The tracks are fresh.'

Xian Gui wrinkled his nose slightly. "Everyone, it seems a guest has gone ahead of us. We should hurry. Judging by these footprints..."

I observed the various footprints and spoke. Xian Gui nodded. "The leader of the Yao Clan, Jiao Yan, is from the Blood Sect, and they know how to temporarily appease the Fire Demon by offering blood. Let's hurry."

We quickened our pace. Soon, we saw a dense blood mist ahead. 

'Is it a blood sacrifice...'

I frowned. Due to Yuan Li, I not only disliked but abhorred human sacrifices like blood rituals. As we moved closer to the blood mist, we saw Jiao Yan and the Yao Clan group we had encountered earlier. 

'Hmm... the number of Yao Clan members is the same... so...'

Upon closer inspection, it seemed Jiao Yan was drawing blood from his clan members to offer as a blood sacrifice. However, Xian Gui was startled and shouted, "Damn it, seniors! Those Yao Clan bastards are trying to tame the Fire Demon! If they succeed, it will be troublesome. We must attack now!"

Simultaneously, Xian Gui gathered energy in the form of a black dragon and launched it into the blood mist. 

Boom! 

An explosion echoed, followed by Jiao Yan's voice from within. 

'Hmm, if there's no guarantee they won't harm us, there's no need to fight...'

"Shut up, filthy Yao Clan scum. We humans don't listen to your nonsense!"

"How dare you speak to this elder! Die, you trash!"

"Blocking the path of the great human race, it's been a while since I've tasted Yao Clan meat!"

Hearing Jiao Yan's words, the Black Scale Spirit Sect disciples jeered and released their killing intent towards him. Jiao Yan, seemingly enraged, shouted from within the blood mist. He mocked someone as a sadistic killer.

'Is there really such a person among the Black Scale Spirit Sect disciples?'

These people are truly untrustworthy. If there's someone with a strong tendency for sadistic killing, it might be best to eliminate them here. 

Whoosh!

From within the blood mist, a black flame tinged with blood shot towards us. The massive black flame, like a living wave of fire, surged towards us. I sensed the pain and resentment within the black flame and released my Ghost Transformation.

"Indeed, a flame created by a curse... that's its terrifying aspect. It's neither purely a curse nor purely a flame, so to suppress it, we need a curse master, a flame master, and yin energy."

Rumble!

The Black Scale Spirit Sect disciples stepped forward and erected a wall of yin energy. I observed the Fire Demon and let out a sigh. Simultaneously, I noticed the Yao Clan members controlling the Fire Demon with blood from behind.

'Interesting. They control the Fire Demon by feeding it blood. The spiritual energy within the blood must be the key.'

I carefully observed their method, feeling it was somewhat similar to how Yuan Li's blood body was taken by Wu Hye. 

Using Tai Chi to control blood and dominate the body. 

After observing their technique for a while, I extended my left hand. 

Whoosh!

Ghost Transformation erupted from 36 eyes. I raised my left hand and chanted. 

Rumble!

Cursed runes flowed from my seven orifices. Although it was called seven orifices, the skulls on my face lacked nasal bones, so the nose was combined, making it six orifices. Thus, a total of 108 orifices emitted cursed runes. 

My curse had already surpassed the limit of thousands of runes during the Qi Condensation stage. From then on, my curse was judged by [density] and [range] rather than the number of runes. 

During the Qi Condensation stage, I could fill a radius of 3 zhang with cursed runes. 

During the Foundation Establishment stage, I could fill a radius of 300 zhang with cursed runes. 

During the Core Formation stage, I could fill a radius of 30 li with cursed runes. 

During the Nascent Soul stage, I could fill a radius of 3,000 li with cursed runes. 

So, what about now, having reached the Soul Transformation stage?

I exhaled. 

In this situation, even the Black Scale Spirit Sect disciples, who were on the same side, were shocked, their eyes bulging. Even Xian Gui, who always looked down on me, showed a hint of interest at this moment. 

Whoosh—

The second floor of the Dimensional Pouch, the entire Daoist layer, began to turn pitch black. 

* * *

The human race, the Yao Clan, and several other celestial clans excluding the Zhangmu Clan and the Biyi Clan. 

The Hanling Clan, the Yinglin Clan, and the Yepta Clan disciples had just reached the end of the water flow layer, arriving at the entrance to the Daoist layer. 

"Phew, there's nothing to gain except for the demonic liquid within the bodies of the Fire Demons."

"Since none of us have demonic beasts, it's best to sell it to a disciple who practices demonic techniques later."

"Well, demonic liquid isn't bad, but it's too meager a reward for risking our lives against the Fire Demons."

"Sigh, excluding the Fire Demons, the rest was taken by the human race, the Yao Clan, and the Soul Transformation seniors, making it hard to gain anything on the first floor..."

They all sighed in unison. 

"Still, it's understandable since it's the water flow layer of the Daoist realm. Let's keep our spirits up. The real treasure is in the Daoist layer. Even if we don't go to the third floor, just obtaining some decent magical treasures, techniques, or spiritual medicines on the second floor will be worth it."

"That's true... the first floor wasn't meant for storing items anyway. Let's head to the second floor!"

The group of ten celestial clan disciples cheerfully prepared to ascend to the Daoist layer. 

At that moment.

Hiss—

"...?"

"Huh, what is that...!"

The faces of the ten disciples were filled with shock, fear, and despair. 

"What on earth is happening on the second floor!!!"

The second floor, the Daoist layer. From above, an enormous amount of curses was flowing down like a waterfall. 

They fled in terror without looking back. 

* * *

The world was shrouded in darkness. 

Even the Fire Demon, which had been displaying its might before me, froze in place. 

I assessed the Fire Demon. Considering the level of the being that created it, it must have been much stronger when it was first created. 

If it were still that strong, I wouldn't have been able to handle it. 

'But time has weakened its malevolence.'

After tens of thousands of years, the Fire Demon had significantly weakened. 

I reached out towards the Fire Demon. It whimpered like a dog needing to relieve itself, trembling as my hand touched it. 

Hiss—

I began to condense the cursed runes I had scattered across the heavens and earth into a single point. 

Boom!

The resulting cursed rune emitted a malevolent aura similar to the one I had created with other curse masters in the Black Scale Spirit Sect. 

During the Core Formation stage, I had needed to combine forces with others to create such a rune, but now, in the Soul Transformation stage, I could do it alone. 

The Fire Demon, overwhelmed by the malevolent aura of my cursed rune, shrank completely. The once massive Fire Demon was now smaller than a fist. 

It couldn't move, having consumed the blood of the Yao Clan members. 

Xian Gui shouted, "Now, extinguish it!"

The Black Scale Spirit Sect disciples snapped out of their daze and launched their techniques to extinguish the Fire Demon. 

Hiss—

But in truth, the Fire Demon had already shrunk so much under the pressure of my cursed rune that it didn't require any techniques. They could have simply stomped it out. 

Xian Gui signaled to them with his eyes. "See, I told you it was a good idea to follow my plan, didn't I?"

The Black Scale Spirit Sect disciples showed signs of relief. 

"As expected of Xian Gui."

"I trusted you. Haha..."

On the surface, it seemed they were celebrating my recruitment, but I remained cautious, sensing their lingering unease. 

My gaze turned to the Yao Clan members. Surprisingly, Jiao Yan had already fled to the third floor. 

If he hadn't fled after witnessing that curse, he would have been either a brave man or a madman. 

The other Yao Clan members began to realize that Jiao Yan had fled. The Nascent Soul stage Yao Clan members turned pale and met my gaze. 

With 36 eyes emitting the remnants of the cursed rune, I spoke. 

I wasn't a mad sadistic killer, and I had no reason to kill those who had lost their will to fight, so I tried to be as kind as possible. I offered to let them rest on the second floor as long as they didn't interfere with our objectives on the third floor. 

However, for some reason, the Yao Clan members screamed in terror. 

"Ahhh!"

"Senior, please spare us!"

"Damn it, I need to get out of here!"

"Run! If we get caught by the madman, we're dead!"

They all screamed and scattered in all directions. 

Watching them transform into their true forms and flee in panic, I felt a sense of absurdity. 

It seemed they had misunderstood, thinking I would kill them. Given the nature of the human race, it was understandable. 

Or perhaps they feared the mad sadistic killer rumored to be among the Black Scale Spirit Sect. 

'These Black Scale Spirit Sect members are useless in such situations...'

Bringing a notorious figure to the Dimensional Pouch only attracted unnecessary attention. 

However, I needed to question them about the control technique they used on the Fire Demon. 

'I might find a way to completely free Yuan Li's body from Seo Hyul's influence, so it's essential.'

Whoosh—

Crack, crack, crack!

I began to operate my technique. 

The surrounding area started to desertify under the influence of my death energy. Dust and sand flew everywhere. 

Great Desert Sea Star. 

Severing the Surface and Scattering. 

Rumble!

The 'death forms' attached to my shoulders began to emerge from my body. 

The deaths of my 18 past lives. Those forms... 

As they emerged from my body, they each formed a physical body with their ghostly energy. 

Each one was like a Ghost King who had mastered the Ghost King Transformation to the extreme, creating 18 clones. 

In exchange, I lost the upper part of my head, but it didn't matter. Losing my head was nothing new. 

Whoosh—

Whoosh—

Whoosh—

The death forms, each equivalent to a Nascent Soul stage Ghost King, scattered in all directions, heading towards the Yao Clan members. 

Each could use the Ghost King Transformation, Great Desert Sea Star, Six Extreme Yin Thunder Body, and Yin Soul Ghost Curse, as well as some martial arts, so capturing them wouldn't be difficult. 

Eerie ghostly wails echoed everywhere. 

* * *

Thud, thud, thud—

A Yao Beast from the Quema Clan, a branch of the Horse Clan. 

Juma transformed into his true form and ran on all fours like a madman. 

'Please don't chase me! Please! Heaven and Earth, please protect me!'

His mind was filled with the fear that the mad Soul Transformation stage ghost would chase him. 

He knew at a glance that the being was insane. 

From the first time he saw the ghost with 'achievements' displayed on its shoulders, he had vowed never to encounter it. 

'Damn Jiao Yan, that shark-headed bastard. This is all because of his foolishness!'

But everything had gone wrong. 

The ghost would now hunt them down to satisfy its desires. 

Perhaps the ghost had been holding back for a long time. 

But Juma had seen such madmen before in his 2,000 years of life. 

They couldn't easily restrain their 'desires' and would release their filthy 'desires' every other day. 

And when they occasionally restrained their 'desires,' the intensity was much stronger when it finally erupted. 

The ghost had been quiet until now. 

But now, with no need to hold back, anyone caught by the ghost would become part of its grotesque 'hobby.' 

Juma cursed Jiao Yan as he ran. 

Fortunately, Juma was quite fast. 

In the Dimensional Pouch, where flying techniques and levitation were forbidden, Juma's speed was unmatched. 

Unless the Soul Transformation stage ghost was determined to chase him, he could escape. 

At that moment.

Bang, bang, bang!

Juma noticed strange sounds coming from behind. 

Shiver!

He turned to look, his heart pounding. 

And his eyes widened in shock. 

"How, how is this possible!?"

The ghost's victim, presumed to be a ghostly creature, was flying towards him, stepping on the air. 

"Flying techniques, levitation, and using gravity for flight are all 'forbidden,' so how is it flying!!!"

The ghostly creature emitted a chilling wail as it flew towards Juma. 

Juma strengthened his entire body and ran even faster. 

At one point, it seemed he was gaining distance, but when he looked back again, he couldn't believe his eyes. 

Whoosh—

The ghostly creature seemed to be absorbing a round object into its hand. 

And after absorbing the object, its speed increased tenfold, closing the distance rapidly. 

'If I get caught, I'm dead! If I get caught, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead...'

Juma's breathing became ragged. 

But the ghostly creature's body was covered in circuits, and the gap between them was closing. 

"Hiiik...! Don't come! Don't come!!!"

'No, no...!'

He shouted in fear. 

Juma's pupils shook wildly. 

'I'm so scared... I'm losing strength...!'

Juma realized his legs were giving out. 

But he couldn't afford to stop! He had to run faster! 

'Even if I have to burn my life...!'

However, Juma clearly heard it. 

The ghostly creature's voice, chanting a curse while forming hand seals. 

"Ah, ah..."

The ghostly creature was about to use a curse. 

The same one he had seen earlier...!

"Ahhh!!!"

And so, Juma, who had managed to run the farthest, the fastest, and the longest among the fleeing Yao Beasts, was caught. 

* * *

Whoosh—

Swimming up the chains from the second to the third floor, Jiao Yan gritted his teeth. 

The Yao Clan members he had abandoned were likely being slaughtered by the mad ghost. 

Perhaps their heads were being ripped off and their skins flayed, their souls extracted to become part of the ghost's collection. 

The Blood Sect was known to be as cold-blooded and ruthless as the human race. 

But they were still people. 

Jiao Yan also had his own conscience and morals. 

'I'm sorry.'

Deep down, he felt guilty for the Yao Clan members who had been brutally sacrificed. 

"...But I have no choice...!"

Jiao Yan's eyes turned bloodshot as he clenched his teeth. 

"I must save my wife...! For that, I will sacrifice anyone...! Absolutely!"

He had already sworn to abandon his conscience, morals, and loyalty. 

To protect what was precious, he would do anything! 

Whoosh—

Reaching the third floor, the Offering Layer, he looked around. 

The distance between the first and second floors was quite long, but the distance between the second and third floors was barely half of that. 

It was said that originally, the Dimensional Pouch of the True Dragon Immortal had only three layers. 

The first layer was the Water Flow, the second layer was the Daoist, and the third layer was the Ultimate. 

But at some point, the True Dragon Immortal stopped ascending to the third layer and created an additional layer between the second and third layers. 

Thus, the third layer became the fourth layer, and the new layer between the Daoist and Ultimate layers became the Offering Layer, the third layer. 

If the first layer was the Daoist realm and the second layer was the Dimensional Pouch, then the third layer was a kind of 'altar.' 

This realm was also known as the Dimensional Pouch of the True Dragon Immortal, but it was said that the True Dragon Immortal used it for various purposes, including offering sacrifices to 'a certain being' he worshipped. 

Whoosh, whoosh!

Chains of burning water connected the first and second layers, and the second and third layers, extending everywhere. 

The destination of these chains was the Offering Layer. 

The fourth layer, the Ultimate Layer, could only be accessed through a special method or by a Fusion stage cultivator. 

However, since Fusion stage cultivators were forbidden from entering the Dimensional Pouch, the fourth layer was practically non-existent. 

Jiao Yan hurried to the center of the Offering Layer, fearing the mad ghost would catch up. 

The Offering Layer was not as vast as the first and second layers. 

And unlike the first and second layers, the Offering Layer was not as hot. 

In fact, it was filled with water energy, making Jiao Yan, a sea Yao Clan member, feel more invigorated. 

'But the water energy also benefits the ghost who practices ghost techniques.'

The Black
