The Dead (5)

‘There’s no need to kill him.’

I slowly drew the power of my true self through this body. I lent this guy my strength, and whatever he did with it was his own choice. There was no reason for me to directly interfere with his grudges.

Viiing—

I gathered qi through my power and created a barrier. Though hastily made and crude, it was enough to prevent the cultivator in the Qi Accumulation Stage from breaking through.

Rumble—

“Damn it, you! What kind of sorcery is this?”

Fiery red flames battered the barrier.

‘What kind of spiritual roots does this guy have? Ah, water and metal. But he hasn’t mastered both, only reaching the Qi Accumulation Stage with basic water techniques.’

Ignoring the old man swinging a fire whip and spewing flames above my barrier, I vibrated the spiritual energy within my body.

Wuuung—

The Heavenly Qi Induction of the Celestial Investigator was ultimately a lower version of the power of the Qi Accumulation Stage. Using water-attribute magic as a medium, it exerted power over the qi.

Rumble!

In an instant, the sky began to darken. Noticing something strange, the surrounding Qi Accumulation Stage cultivators looked up at the sky. And as I reached out my hand to the sky,

Swoosh—

Rain began to fall. Torrential rain poured down on the area that had been burning all around. I fixed the celestial phenomenon in the sky. It would probably rain in this area for seven days and nights.

Only then did the 12th cultivator in the Qi Accumulation Stage realize something was wrong and widened his eyes.

“W-wait… Your eyes…? Yes, possession! You’ve connected with a higher being and are borrowing its power!”

I moved the man’s body and looked around at the Qi Accumulation Stage cultivators. They flinched and avoided my gaze, then were all startled.

“T-the shadow….”

“He’s turned into a monster with 19 heads….”

“Shh! Everyone, be quiet!”

The 12th cultivator in the Qi Accumulation Stage, who seemed to have some sense, formed a hand seal and spoke.

“Yuhui, you fool! Have you allowed your body to be possessed by a higher being? Snap out of it!”

Wuuung—

Whether it was part of some spell, I felt my consciousness being stimulated as the voice of the Qi Accumulation Stage cultivator echoed.

‘A type of consciousness technique. He’s trying to talk to the person I’ve taken over.’

I could have blocked the voice from reaching my consciousness, but I let it through. Soon, I felt the consciousness of the man I had taken over awaken slightly.

“Ugh, ugh….”

Yuhui moved his mouth and laughed.

“What’s wrong, old man? Keep attacking. I’ve successfully connected with a great being and borrowed its power!”

“Damn it, you fool! This is a matter between your family and ours! How could you borrow the power of such an evil being from another world?”

The old man scolded Yuhui sternly with a furious face.

“Snap out of it! Do you intend to bring the power of another world to this land?”

“What does it matter…! If it’s land I can’t have anyway, it doesn’t matter!”

“Damn it, do you even know what that being from another world will do?”

‘…I won’t do much.’

I cleared my throat inwardly and spoke.

Wuuung—

I reversed the power, turning it into repulsion.

Boom—

“Ugh, Yuhui! Think carefully! That being is an evil entity from another world!!!”

Most of the Qi Accumulation Stage cultivators were flung hundreds of miles away, but the Qi Accumulation Stage cultivator held his ground and shouted. Judging by his intent, he seemed genuinely afraid and concerned about the existence of ‘me.’

“Do not trust beings from another world! I’m not saying this as an enemy, but as a cultivator of the Mengyun Continent! Those beings are evil, ruthless, and have no tears or mercy…!”

‘…It’s not that bad….’

“They are beings that must never be dealt with carelessly!”

I increased the repulsion force, and eventually, the Qi Accumulation Stage cultivator couldn’t hold on and was flung away.

Whoosh—

Not only the Qi Accumulation Stage cultivators but also the cultivators causing trouble in this area fled.

I observed Yuhui’s body.

‘I could turn him into a Nascent Soul cultivator right now….’

Just by infusing him with the celestial spiritual energy, that much was possible. But I clicked my tongue as I looked at Yuhui’s soul.

‘If I do that, his soul will shatter immediately. Even just a strand of my consciousness is enough to almost break him.’

It would probably be difficult to even raise him to the Core Formation Stage.

Wuuung—

The best I could do was activate the pathways within his body, making it easier for him to reach the 28th level of the Qi Accumulation Stage.

If he were at the Fusion Stage or the Nascent Soul Stage, I could lend him power and receive a much more diverse reward. But for ordinary Qi Accumulation Stage cultivators, the rewards were limited.

The Five Blessings are longevity, wealth, health, virtue, and a peaceful death. Why does longevity come first among the Five Blessings? The reason is simple.

‘Longevity is the most basic resource for accumulating the Five Blessings.’

The accumulation of longevity requires receiving something precious related to lifespan. So, it directly takes lifespan.

The accumulation of wealth requires receiving something precious related to wealth. And the longer the lifespan, the more opportunities to accumulate wealth, so lifespan is also related to wealth.

The accumulation of health is the same. Health is life force, which is also related to lifespan.

Virtue is a bit different, but it can also be obtained through lifespan.

Therefore, those who accumulate the Five Blessings mostly take lifespan from the majority. Of course, most would take all the remaining lifespan after lending power once, but I couldn’t bring myself to do that and only took ten years of lifespan.

Wuuung—

When I opened my eyes, the spiritual land shone brightly, and auspicious energy radiated from within. It was Yuhui’s lifespan. Following the teachings of the Celestial, I placed Yuhui’s lifespan into the formation and offered a simple ritual.

Wuuung—

The realm of the spirits responded, accepting Yuhui’s lifespan. At the same time, the ghostly energy moved and settled as a beam of light in one corner of my dantian.

Flash!

‘This is….’

A very small, tower-like structure, or perhaps a toothpick-like stick, settled next to the accumulation of wealth in one corner of my dantian.

‘This is the foundation of the accumulation of longevity….’

It seemed I would need to repeat this about a thousand times to accumulate longevity.

‘A thousand times….’

I would need to take a lifespan of ten thousand years to finally establish the accumulation of longevity.

I sat and pondered. Taking ten thousand years of lifespan from someone. Even if it was little by little, was this really right?

As I was contemplating, the Celestial clicked her tongue in disapproval.

“It seems you only took about ten years of lifespan. What was the cultivation level of the person you borrowed power from?”

“He was at the Qi Accumulation Stage.”

“What! Then if you took all his remaining lifespan, it would be 300 years! Where did you sell off 300 years of lifespan and only take ten years?”

The Celestial nagged as if she was wronged.

“Well… there’s no need to go that far.”

“What do you mean there’s no need! It’s a fair trade they agreed to!”

“Fair trade….”

Indeed, if they agreed, it might seem fair. But I still didn’t like this method and decided to take only the minimum lifespan necessary to accumulate the blessings.

I nodded, letting the Celestial’s nagging go in one ear and out the other.

“Alright. I’ll think about it next time.”

“You rascal, you’re not really planning to listen to me, are you!”

“Oh dear….”

She grumbled and seemed to be leaving the basement in a huff. At that moment,

Rumble!

“Hmm…?”

Suddenly, the entire Wujigyo Sect shook. I quickly transformed into my ghostly form and sharpened my senses. The Celestial glared up at the basement.

“Ho, it seems intruders have arrived.”

“Hmm….”

I was about to go out and punish them, but then I realized it was almost ‘night’ and sat back on the throne.

“Stay seated. I’ll go see which bold fools have come. The guardians will drive them away, so don’t worry.”

At her words, I created a clone to monitor the situation and waited in place.

‘I hope they don’t come to this room….’

* * *

Rumble—

The Wujigyo Sect. Inside the training grounds of the sect’s territory. Three figures appeared there.

Baeklin, the master of the Baekmaek Sect, with a body made of white bones. Eumwa, the master of the Eumum Sect, wearing a veil of shadows. Wihon, the master of the Sihu Sect, exuding green energy from his entire body.

The three cultivators in the Qi Accumulation Stage shuddered as they stepped into the training grounds.

“What a vile place! What have they done to the captured spirits!?”

In their eyes, they saw several spirits trapped in puppets. The spirits were all slightly grotesque, as they had been made into puppets and cursed dolls.

“Trapping spirits in those narrow, suffocating cursed dolls! I can understand the mad cult leader’s hobby!”

Eumwa shouted in a furious voice.

“They look hideous and terrifying! How could they think of making such monstrous puppets!”

Wihon screamed as he looked at a puppet resembling General Seo. The spirit trapped in the puppet, resembling General Seo, roared in fury.

“Wait, aren’t you the master of the Gunggul Sect, a subordinate sect of the Baekmaek Sect?”

Baeklin recognized the voice of the spirit and was startled. The puppet resembling General Seo, the master of the Gunggul Sect, nodded.

“Do you have no pride in your sect!? How could you betray your loyalty to our higher sect and become a puppet of the demonic cult?”

“What nonsense! You’ve already been brainwashed by the demonic cult’s sorcery!”

Baeklin lamented the demonic cult’s evil deeds as he looked at his former subordinate who had become a fanatic.

“Step aside! Even if you’ve been brainwashed and become a fanatic, I can’t kill my former subordinate, so I’ll give you a chance!”

The master of the Gunggul Sect, resembling General Seo, roared in anger at Baeklin’s words.

Rumble!

Clack, clack, clack—

At the same time, the spirits given puppet bodies by Seoeunhyun gathered at the command of the master of the Gunggul Sect. In an instant, the western training grounds of the Wujigyo Sect were filled with countless cursed dolls.

The three cultivators in the Qi Accumulation Stage looked at the countless cursed dolls blocking their way with tense expressions. The dolls had pale skin, white bones, and stiff, lifeless puppet bodies, not the sturdy bodies of zombies. They couldn’t even control their expressions, always wearing the same face, making them look grotesque.

They looked at the pitiful spirits turned into puppets and their eyes burned even more.

But then, Wihon looked up at the sky.

“Hey, Baeklin, Eumwa!”

“What is it?”

“We don’t have much time. If we waste time here, it will eventually become day, and the cult leader will descend upon us.”

“Hmm….”

“Indeed….”

Looking at Baeklin and Eumwa, Wihon’s eyes shone.

“I’ll hold them off. You two go and cut off the root of this evil cult!”

“Hmm…!”

“Wihon…!”

“Go on!”

Wihon stepped forward and began to grow in size.

Rumble!

The green energy emanating from his body turned into fur. Wihon gradually transformed into a monstrous beast and roared. In his monstrous form, Wihon blocked the army of cursed dolls, and Baeklin and Eumwa, seeing this, steeled their resolve with trembling voices.

“Wihon!”

“Go! This is a precious opportunity created by Wihon’s sacrifice!”

Baeklin led Eumwa quickly past the training grounds and into the interior of the sect. At first, Eumwa seemed weak, but soon he regained his strength and ran with Baeklin through the sect.

How long had they been running through the sect? The two spirits suddenly noticed something strange.

“Wait, Master Baek. The surroundings….”

“Indeed. It’s a formation.”

Flash!

Before they knew it, they were running through a misty meadow.

“I’ll break the formation. You keep watch.”

“Yes.”

As Baeklin formed a hand seal to break the formation, someone stepped out of the mist.

“Who goes there!”

Eumwa glared and shouted at the figure in the mist. The person who emerged from the mist was a woman in a pink robe, Kim Yeon, who greeted them politely.

“Greetings, I am Kim Yeon, the Left Guardian of the Wujigyo Sect.”

“Damn it, the Ghostly Demon King!”

“To think we’d run into the most evil and wicked being!”

Baeklin and Eumwa were flustered, and Kim Yeon looked at them with a faint smile.

“You two cannot pass through here.”

Baeklin and Eumwa looked at each other and nodded.

“We know you are the most vicious brainwasher of the Wujigyo Sect. But that means if we subdue you, we can find a way to break the brainwashing of the innocent spirits.”

Baeklin looked at Kim Yeon with a solemn voice.

“We will defeat you and free everyone from the brainwashing!”
