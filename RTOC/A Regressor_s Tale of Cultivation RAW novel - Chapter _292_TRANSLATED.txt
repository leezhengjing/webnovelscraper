My name is (7) Chuchuchut! I accelerated my consciousness, connecting Ratio and Spirit through the Mysterious Heart Sutra, pulling him into my accelerated mental world. 

"Explain the technique."

Ratio began explaining the technique one by one.

"Rejected."

I interrupted Ratio and erased the Yin Ram Demon Technique from my mind. Connected to an ancient existence with unknown origins? It was likely connected to true immortals, like the Taishan Flame Emperor Technique or the Red Thunder Heaven Calamity Technique. I had no plans to learn it, as I wasn't eager to connect directly with suspicious entities. I only sought to interpret the mnemonic I obtained from the Water Realm.

"It possesses Yang Gang power, making it a natural enemy to Yin-based techniques and reducing the effectiveness of Yang-based attacks."

"Hmm..."

This seemed quite attractive. There was no mention of sacrificing anyone, and the cultivation speed being dozens of times faster was a significant advantage for someone as mediocre as me.

"What is this?"

"Hmm... Is that why it has 'Ziyang' in its name?"

"Are there any side effects?"

Changing skin color wasn't a big issue. Although having purple skin might look strange, there were many ways to resolve it.

"...."

Purple skin and a bald head... After some thought, I decided I could endure that.

"Are there more side effects?"

"...."

I let out a silent sigh. If my libido surged, it would be troublesome when dealing with beings like Zheng Liao. With my willpower, I could suppress lust, but if an enemy like Zheng Liao amplified it, it would be hard to endure.

"It can't be helped. If I can somehow endure it by removing my testicles..."

I glared at Ratio for recommending a technique with so many side effects. 

"...."

In short, purple skin, a bald head, surging lust, and becoming a cripple if I release my essence due to the child technique.

"Why did you recommend this to me?"

I sighed inwardly, hoping Ratio wouldn't notice. If I were truly the incarnation of the Underworld's envoy, there would be no worries, but I still had to remove my testicles to stay sane against Zheng Liao. Moreover, removing my testicles could cause significant loss of power due to the connection between lust and power in techniques like the Ziyang Radiant Demon Technique.

"Rejected."

I frowned at the title "Corpse Eater."

"Is this a technique for eating corpses?"

"Rejected."

"Next."

"Well... I know it, but explain it to see your understanding."

As I listened to the explanation, I realized something.

"The Anhun True Technique... isn't a demonic technique."

"Hmm..."

The fact that it wasn't a demonic technique was appealing. However, in terms of utility, the Anhun True Technique was a lower version of the Mysterious Heart Sutra. It might be slightly better in communicating with spirits, but in other aspects, it was inferior. Moreover, I already had the Yin Soul Ghost Command, so I didn't need another technique for controlling spirits. It was a chicken rib technique, so I felt no need to learn it.

"Rejected."

"Rejected."

"Rejected."

As I rejected every technique presented, Ratio seemed to lose confidence and finally recommended the last demonic technique. I frowned as I listened to the mnemonic of the Ghost Immortal Demon Technique.

"Isn't the Ghost Immortal Demon Technique a technique for devouring spirits to gain power?"

"Hmm...?"

"Hmm..."

In that case, it wasn't really a demonic technique but just a technique. I realized that the Ghost Immortal Demon Technique was the most appealing among the recommended techniques.

"And it includes the method to learn the Four Beast Technique..."

I released the acceleration of my consciousness and picked up the Ghost Immortal Demon Technique from the recommended demonic techniques. Then, I went to Song Gil, the library keeper, and presented the technique.

"I'll take this one."

"Hmm, the Ghost Immortal Demon Technique?"

Song Gil's expression turned strange.

"Is there a problem?"

"The Ghost Immortal Demon Technique is shunned due to its extreme difficulty. If you succeed in learning it, it boasts great power, but... it's not recommended."

"It's fine. I'll take it."

"Well... do as you wish. However, once you choose the Ghost Immortal Demon Technique, you can't change it, and to enter the library again, you must accumulate at least 100 merit points in the Black Ghost Valley. Understood?"

"I understand."

After choosing the technique, we left the library. Eubyeon was waiting for us and spoke once we all came out.

"Now that everyone is out, I'll explain our sect's merit point system."

He continued his explanation.

"The merit point system is adopted by many cultivation sects. You earn merit points by completing sect missions, which you can use to access the library, use the convenience functions of the Seomyeong Hall, or seek teachings from the Ghost Kings. Every ten years, you must complete a mandatory sect mission. You can receive your desired mission at the Office Hall, so I recommend visiting there."

After giving us a few more explanations, Eubyeon turned into a wisp of black smoke and flew to the Seomyeong Hall. The five of us scattered to explore the East Hall or various parts of the Seomyeong Hall, and I asked Ratio for directions to the Office Hall.

"A merit point system, huh..."

Thinking back, the Golden Thunder Sect had a similar system. However, Jeon Myeonghun and I were exempted as the future of the sect. The Changcheon Sect didn't have a merit point system; you could use the facilities by defeating the library keeper or winning duels against senior brothers. In the Sea Dragon Palace, I used Seo Hyul's treasury, so I never felt inconvenienced in my training. As a puppet of the Monster Army, I didn't need anything. This was my first time experiencing such a system.

When I arrived at the Office Hall, ghostly wails echoed everywhere. Spirits were flying around, muttering something, which turned out to be missions. The spirits shuddered when they sensed Ratio's presence within me but didn't flee in panic, likely due to some kind of magical brainwashing.

"I want to see what missions are available."

Wriggle, wriggle...

Ratio revealed his head over my shoulder and shouted loudly inside the Office Hall. The spirits, who were announcing missions, flocked to us. The disciples of the Black Ghost Valley, who were choosing missions, turned their attention to us.

"Who is that guy?"

"Was that the ghostly wail of the Heavenly Ghost King?"

"He's controlling a Heavenly Ghost King? Is he an elder?"

"Impossible. He must be a new Yin Soul disciple. New Yin Soul disciples serve a Ghost King for about half a year before obtaining their own ghost servants. It's just a phase."

"Still, the Ghost King must be kind to help a junior by gathering spirits for him..."

They noticed Ratio's presence but didn't say much. However, I sensed their thoughts. They were all looking down on me.

"Hmm, they all have at least a Primordial Ghost King within them."

They had a strong connection with their Ghost Kings, unlike me, who had 'invited' Ratio from a shrine. They had nurtured their Ghost Kings themselves.

"That's the Ghost Dao Spirit... a Ghost Servant."

The main spirits controlled by the disciples of the Black Ghost Valley. These spirits, called Ghost Dao Spirits or Ghost Servants, helped the disciples in their cultivation of Ghost Dao techniques. I observed them briefly through the Black Demon Mask and then ignored them, focusing on the spirits.

I looked at the missions.

"The higher the difficulty, the better the rewards."

The mission with the highest merit points was to go to the Celestial Wing Clan, one of the Celestial Clans, and establish a Black Ghost Valley branch composed of Celestial Wing Clan members. It exempted you from mandatory missions for a thousand years and awarded 60,000 merit points.

"In other words, it's a mission that requires at least a thousand years of hardship."

I had no intention of struggling with the local forces in the Celestial Wing Clan's territory, so I lost interest and looked at other missions. Then, I heard a spirit muttering something and turned my attention to it.

"Hmm..."

It offered a considerable amount of merit points and was in a field I was confident in, so I reached out to the spirit repeating the mission.

"Seolip is adapting well to the Black Ghost Valley."

Once he gets more accustomed, I planned to use Seolip to find Kang Minhee.

"Then, it's time for me to move."

Swoosh...

Using the Moon Water Palace Concealment Technique, I left Cheonbulsan without the other Taesus noticing. A few days later, I arrived at the entrance to the True Demon Realm.

"In the Human-Demon War, the humans are currently being pushed back by the True Demon Realm Taesus."

However, the humans were preparing an absurd plan called the Celestial Destruction Formation. A move to inflict maximum damage on the Demon Realm before retreating.

"I can't let that happen."

The reason for preparing such a ridiculous plan was simple.

"They think they have a way out."

They believed they could retreat to the Guanghan Realm even after causing massive damage to the True Demon Realm. Therefore, there was only one solution.

"I'll make sure they can't return."

I took out Seo Hyul's face from the storage and covered my face with it, then deactivated the Moon Water Palace Concealment Technique, revealing myself at the entrance to the True Demon Realm.

"I'll close the entrance to the True Demon Realm."

I wouldn't close it completely. I planned to make it so that they could reopen it with effort. If the entrance to the True Demon Realm was closed, the humans wouldn't be able to execute the Celestial Destruction Formation without a retreat route. Moreover, the Black Dragon King Hyun Eum wouldn't be able to threaten Oh Hyunseok by entering the True Demon Realm, and Chang Hoja wouldn't be able to cross over either. By causing trouble with Seo Hyul's face, I could instill immense hostility towards Seo Hyul among the humans. Lastly, if the news of Seo Hyul's survival reached Gyuryeon, her anger towards me would significantly diminish. It was a move with five benefits.

Take this, Seo Hyul.

"Who goes there!"

The guards at the entrance to the True Demon Realm, the Four Beast Technique practitioners, looked at me warily. I covered myself with the aura of a celestial beast, disguising myself as a yokai. In that state, I imitated Seo Hyul's soft and relaxed voice.

"My name is Seo Hyul."

Rumble!

A white mist-like power enveloped my hand, forming the shape of a dragon claw.

"I am the Grand General of the Sea Dragon Clan."

Boom!

The entrance to the True Demon Realm shook as if it would collapse.
