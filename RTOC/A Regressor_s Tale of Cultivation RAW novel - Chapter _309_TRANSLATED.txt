I raised the Invisible Sword. Since Yuan Yu's blood body had not yet been trained, it could not exert the full power of the Invisible Sword. At most, it could use about 80% of its strength. In other words, my main body had been "trained." And perhaps because of that, surprisingly, Seo Hyul, who had absorbed me, demonstrated the use of the Invisible Sword of "Dapcheon." 

"However, he could not communicate with the Invisible Sword." He failed to show the realization of Geopcheon. Nevertheless, he used the Invisible Sword, a technique related to my mental image. That fact gave me chills. How could such a thing be possible? To prevent the risk of potential encroachment, I severed even the slightest connection with my main body. 

Afterward, I used the sound transmission technique to call Hong Beom. Hong Beom quickly ran to my call and knelt down. 

"Did you call for me, Master?" 

"Bring Kim Yeon and Jeon Myung-hoon. And... inform the Taesoo Association that I am going into seclusion for training. I will be in seclusion for about a thousand years, so if they have any messages, they should come to my clone." 

"Understood. By the way, Master..." 

"Hmm?" 

"Is this your clone?" 

"Yes, is there a problem?" 

"No, nothing." 

Hong Beom, who had been staring at me intently for a moment, shook his head. 

"How dull. Go on." 

Hong Beom bowed his head once and disappeared from my sight. 

A while later, Kim Yeon and Jeon Myung-hoon stood before me. Kim Yeon had just returned from Hanumtaek. She looked at me and tilted her head in puzzlement. 

'Could she have noticed that the body in Hanumtaek and this body are the same?' 

I broke into a cold sweat internally and asked Kim Yeon to explain what she had heard from Kang Min-hee. Kim Yeon relayed Kang Min-hee's words to Jeon Myung-hoon. 

"Well, it doesn't matter. I'll follow whatever you say." 

Jeon Myung-hoon nodded and readily agreed. I asked Kim Yeon. 

"Yeon-ah, Deputy Director Oh Hyun-seok will be coming back soon." 

"What? The Deputy Director too?" 

"Yes." 

As a Taesoo, I was sharing quite a bit of information with the Taesoo Association. Among the shared information was that Oh Hyun-seok of the Changcheon Gaebyeokmun was currently knocking on the door of the Gwanghan Realm from beyond the boundary. We would be able to meet Oh Hyun-seok in about three or four days. 

'With this, I've achieved my goal of gathering comrades.' 

The remaining goals were to achieve the Four Pillars, obtain the Taesan Yeolje Gong Gugal, explore the Jeomuldo of Jung Ryong Jin-in, live for over a thousand years, and completely kill Seo Hyul. 

'Seo Hyul seems to have accepted the seclusion training, thinking he can enter the Four Pillars with my body...' 

I was confident that no matter how cunning Seo Hyul was, he would realize something was wrong after 300 years and cry out to the heavens within the Eastern Region. I knew my original body's talents better than anyone. 

A few days later, we went to the entrance of the Jinma Realm and met a familiar face. 

"Deputy Director Oh!" 

"..."

It was Oh Hyun-seok. He looked at Kim Yeon with hollow eyes, then turned his gaze to me and Jeon Myung-hoon behind her. 

"How have you been, Hyun-seok hyung?" 

"Have you... been well?" 

I greeted him calmly, and Jeon Myung-hoon greeted him with an awkward expression. Oh Hyun-seok looked at us for a moment and then slumped to the ground. 

"...It feels like a dream. We really survived that battlefield." 

He sighed and caught his breath. Having reached the level of a Wonyeonggi master, Oh Hyun-seok laughed heartily as he caught his breath. I smiled at him, relieved. 

"Congratulations." 

In this life, he had not been mentally broken by the Black Dragon King or the Blood Yin Realm Master. Chang Ho-ja had not died, and he had only growth ahead of him. I looked at him and smiled bitterly inside. 

'The fate of the Geumshin Cheonraemun, which was related to Jinseon, was twisted, but...' 

Oh Hyun-seok alone could change the situation and alter fate. 

'If I had been a little stronger, could I have saved the entire Geumshin Cheonraemun?' 

Perhaps, just maybe. 

'Let's get stronger quickly.' 

With the cultivation method of the Great Desert Sea Star that I had created, I was confident I could reach the Four Pillars. 

After catching up with Oh Hyun-seok, I sent him back to the Changcheon Gaebyeokmun. 

"So, you want me to reach the Four Pillars and come back?" 

"Yes, I would appreciate it if you could." 

"Haha, alright. I understand. I learned a lot from this Human-Demon War." 

He boarded the giant flying artifact heading to the Changcheon Gaebyeokmun and looked at the entrance of the Jinma Realm with a bitter gaze. The entrance to the Jinma Realm was now completely sealed by the Taesoo of the Jinma Realm. At least humans could no longer recklessly invade the Jinma Realm. 

"Are we humans... good or evil?" 

Oh Hyun-seok muttered as he looked at the Jinma Realm with a confused gaze. 

"I've been pondering that a lot. If I go to the Changcheon Gaebyeokmun and ask my master, he will surely give me a clear answer. He's that kind of person... But what do you think?" 

He looked at us with a troubled gaze and asked. 

"Are humans good or evil? It's been almost 100 years since you came to this world. You must have your own experiences, so think about them and tell me." 

At his words, Kim Yeon answered immediately. Her eyes were filled with certainty. 

"In my opinion... the theory of inherent evil seems more accurate. Pure humans are ultimately a great evil." 

It was an answer only she, who had experienced the 'pure human' Gwaegun, could give. Surprisingly, Jeon Myung-hoon gave the opposite answer. He touched the wooden box in his arms and spoke. 

"Well, I prefer to believe in the theory of inherent goodness. If humans are not good, how could they care for others when facing death?" 

It was an answer only Jeon Myung-hoon, who had heard the dying words of Geum So-hae, could give. 

"Interesting. If we were still working at the company, you two would have given opposite answers..." 

"Well, a lot has happened." 

"...Indeed. A lot has happened." 

At Oh Hyun-seok's words, the two of them made bitter expressions. Truly, we had experienced too many events. 

"So, Eun-hyun, what do you think?" 

"..."

However, I could not answer Oh Hyun-seok's question immediately. 

"...I don't know." 

"You don't know?" 

"Yes. You might think I'm foolish, but I really don't know. No matter how much I think about it, I can't find the answer." 

"...I see. Understood. Your answers have been helpful. I'll take them into consideration." 

It seemed that Oh Hyun-seok had seen many of the ugly sides of humans during the Human-Demon War. He appeared to be confused about the identity of humans. 

After hugging each of us, Oh Hyun-seok departed for the Changcheon Gaebyeokmun. I had a feeling we would meet again soon. 

After sending Oh Hyun-seok off, I entrusted Jeon Myung-hoon to Kim Yeon and asked her to take him to the Black Ghost Valley. 

"Aren't you going, Eun-hyun oppa? Shouldn't you meet Min-hee unnie too?" 

"...I'll meet Kang Min-hee later." 

It seemed I needed more courage to face Kang Min-hee with my original face. Although my main body had sealed her memories arbitrarily, it seemed a bit fortunate in hindsight. 

Kim Yeon nodded and headed to the Black Ghost Valley with Jeon Myung-hoon. After watching them disappear, I quickly headed to the Black Ghost Valley, changing my face back to Seo Rip. For now, it was time to be with Kang Min-hee as Seo Rip, not Seo Eun-hyun. 

* * *

Black Ghost Valley. Inside the Seopmyeongham, in the office of the Ghost Soul Pavilion. 

"Hey, long time no see, you rascal." 

Kang Min-hee tapped her pipe to extinguish the tobacco and greeted Kim Yeon and Jeon Myung-hoon. I stood beside Kang Min-hee with Seo Rip's face and greeted the two. Jeon Myung-hoon and I made eye contact for a moment, and he had a strange expression. Come to think of it, he knew about Yuan Yu's blood body. Fortunately, he seemed to have caught on and closed his mouth after trying to say something. 

Kang Min-hee looked at Jeon Myung-hoon with a curious expression. 

"Ho, honestly, I didn't expect anything, but you've changed a lot, haven't you? That rascal?" 

At her words, Jeon Myung-hoon looked at her with a blank expression and spoke. 

"It seems like you're trying to provoke me, but I apologize for what happened on Earth. I'm sorry." 

"..."

"Anyway, how do I use the shortcut?" 

Kang Min-hee widened her eyes in surprise at Jeon Myung-hoon's response. 

"...You've really grown. Alright, I apologize for trying to provoke you. I'll let you use the shortcut. But what will you pay the Black Ghost Valley? All the disciples of the Geumshin Cheonraemun who used the shortcut before paid the usage fee." 

At her words, Jeon Myung-hoon nodded. 

"Put it on Seo Eun-hyun's tab. He's a Taesoo of the human race now, so he'll get plenty of support." 

Jeon Myung-hoon casually putting the debt on me made both Kang Min-hee and I laugh helplessly. She laughed outwardly, while I laughed inwardly. 

"It seems you haven't changed your habit of liking credit..." 

'This guy. Isn't he too naturally putting it on my tab?' 

Kang Min-hee clicked her tongue and nodded. 

"Fine. I'll collect the fee from Seo Eun-hyun. Do you have proof?" 

Jeon Myung-hoon handed her a recording talisman with my voice. It was a talisman containing my voice, promising to help him in any way when he went to the Ghost Realm. Kang Min-hee nodded. 

"Alright. I'll let you use the shortcut. But as Yeon must have told you, you must follow my orders unconditionally. Otherwise, you can't enter." 

"Understood." 

At his words, Kang Min-hee nodded and led us out of the Seopmyeongham. As I had become a Celestial and received the position of the Ghost Soul Pavilion's head, I followed them as the head of the Ghost Soul Pavilion. 

Outside the Seopmyeongham. In one of the valleys of the Black Ghost Valley. A valley with a terrain like a pool filled with Yin energy. At the bottom of the valley, there was a red pattern drawn as if painted with blood. And around the pattern, long totem poles were planted, facing the center. 

"There are several ways to enter the Ghost Realm. The easiest way is to become a Fusion Stage cultivator, surround yourself with a domain, and break through the boundary of the Ghost Realm. That's the most stable method. With a domain surrounding you, your body won't be damaged by the energy of the Ghost Realm, and it will be the safest way to return." 

She continued. 

"The next way is to die and become a ghost, then enter before being dragged to the Underworld. The Ghost Realm is also connected to the Underworld. And this method is connected to another way, which is to learn ghost cultivation techniques and become a ghost. Or transform your body into a corpse or other undead. This makes using the shortcut overwhelmingly easier, and you can become stronger in the Ghost Realm without harm. But for someone like you, who has nothing to do with ghost cultivation techniques, there are only two options." 

Woo-woong! 

As she formed hand seals, the red pattern began to glow. 

"First, enter the domain of a Fusion Stage cultivator and be protected while going together. Second, use a shortcut like this. And for someone with a living body like you to use the shortcut, one thing is necessary." 

Kang Min-hee pointed to the center of the pattern and looked at Jeon Myung-hoon. 

"Stand there. And no matter what happens, don't leave that spot. If you leave in the middle, the spell will go awry, and you might lose your body." 

"Got it." 

Jeon Myung-hoon calmly stood in the center of the pattern. Kang Min-hee continued to form hand seals and explained further. 

"We'll temporarily make your body 'dead.' Then we'll separate your soul from your body and put your soul through a trial. The soul that passes the trial will gain a 'dream body' called the Illusory Dream Body. With that Illusory Dream Body, you can enter the Ghost Realm." 

"Well, I don't care about any of that... but can I return to my original state?" 

Woo-woong! 

As she completed the hand seals, she focused her consciousness and spoke. 

"The ritual is ready. Shall we begin?" 

"Do it." 

At the same time, black bandages shot out from the mouths of the eight totem poles. The bandages wrapped around Jeon Myung-hoon's limbs. 

"...!" 

Jeon Myung-hoon gritted his teeth. As the bandages wrapped around him, his body began to wither, turning into a mummy-like form. 

"The bandages store your life force. You'll return to normal later, so endure it. Don't leave the spot, and bear with it!" 

Jeon Myung-hoon gritted his teeth and endured the pain of having his life force forcibly extracted. It seemed that being beaten to the point of his body bursting by me had helped. 

After a while, Jeon Myung-hoon had completely transformed into a mummy. Once that happened, the bandages that had been coming out of the totem poles snapped and wrapped around him. 

"Now I'll extract your soul. Endure this too." 

Kudududuk! 

As Kang Min-hee extended her hand, it transformed into a giant ghostly hand. The ghostly hand crossed the air and grabbed the head of the mummified Jeon Myung-hoon. 

Immediately, she exerted force, and Jeon Myung-hoon's original spirit was extracted from his head. The pain seemed to be considerable, as Jeon Myung-hoon could no longer endure and screamed. 

Kang Min-hee quickly placed his original spirit into the red pattern. After a while, Jeon Myung-hoon, who had entered the maze-like pattern, began to follow the path and gradually emerged. 

Eventually, Jeon Myung-hoon's original spirit, now in a semi-transparent form, stood on top of the pattern. That must be the 'dream body' Kang Min-hee had mentioned. 

"Now, go, Jeon Myung-hoon. When you arrive, a guide ghost will attach to you. Never reveal that you are a living person. Got it? No matter how much you are recommended by the Black Ghost Valley, if you reveal that you have a living body, all sorts of scoundrels will come after you. Remember my words. Got it?" 

"Any other precautions can be received from the guide ghost. Then, go well." 

Paaaah! 

As the pattern emitted a red light, Jeon Myung-hoon was sucked into the pattern. I realized that the pattern was connected to the 'shortcut.' 

"It's done. Jeon Myung-hoon has gone through the shortcut. He will arrive in the Ghost Realm." 

"I see..." 

I had one question and asked Kang Min-hee. 

"Elder, may I ask one thing?" 

"What is it?" 

"Can someone else enter the shortcut? For example, someone like me who has learned ghost cultivation techniques and can attempt to become a ghost king..." 

"Hmm, it's impossible right now. You'll have to wait at least 50 years. Jeon Myung-hoon's ritual was quite large, so the shortcut has been strained." 

"I see. Understood." 

I clicked my tongue. If it had been possible to enter within a year, it would have been good to go with Jeon Myung-hoon until the Jeomuldo of Jung Ryong Jin-in opened. But 50 years. It would also take 50 years to return. Moreover, there was no guarantee that others wouldn't use the shortcut, so it could take even longer. 

'Then there's no choice.' 

I had saved Oh Hyun-seok. Jeon Myung-hoon had gone to the Ghost Realm. Now, the remaining tasks were... 

'The Jeomuldo of Jung Ryong Jin-in. And...' 

Advancing to the Four Pillars. I looked at my body and observed the energy of the Great Desert Sea Star swirling inside me. 

'Until the Jeomuldo of Jung Ryong Jin-in opens. I will reach the Four Pillars.' 

With this body and the compatibility with the Great Desert Sea Star, it was entirely possible. 

Of course, I wanted to immediately find a way to kill Seo Hyul. 

'But I am still weak.' 

Therefore, it was better to find a way after reaching the Four Pillars. Just as I couldn't save the Geumshin Cheonraemun but saved Oh Hyun-seok. When I was weak, I couldn't do anything, but as I grew stronger and higher, the range of those I could save expanded. 

I must become stronger. I must rise higher. 

'Until I know and can do more.' 

Therefore, until I entered the Jeomuldo of Jung Ryong Jin-in, I resolved to put all my effort into reaching the Four Pillars. 

* * *

Humans are foolish creatures. They always regret after losing something. I seemed to be no different. 

I opened my mouth in the deep darkness. 

"How persistent, Seo Hyul." 

And then, 'my' mouth opened again. 

"What do you mean, Seo Do-woo?" 

"..."

It had been quite some time since Seo Rip sealed me. Seo Rip had severed the connection between us, and I was left alone in the darkness. At some point, I realized that 'I' was losing control to 'someone.' 

It
