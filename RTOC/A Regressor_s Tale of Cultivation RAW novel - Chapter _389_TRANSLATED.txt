**Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 389: Salt (5)**

Rumble! The entire world began to shake. Liu Lin laughed. 

"Accepting the throne was your first mistake! Haha, if you hadn't taken the throne, the barrier of Penglai Island would have remained strong, preventing any external force from entering. But thanks to you accepting the throne, my true body was able to interfere and take the core of the barrier!"

He burst into maniacal laughter, and I glared at him, trying to quickly connect with my true body. However, my true body was still in a comatose state, and we were unable to fully escape this illusory world to exert our true strength.

"I advise you to go and collect the sacrificial books you wanted. Once the barrier breaks, the sacrificial books will remain in the world of illusions forever, never to be retrieved again...!"

"Shut up." 

I wondered why this guy was babbling so much. It seemed he was trying to confuse me with false information. 'The first thing he said was true, but everything about the sacrificial books is a lie...'

Unfortunately for him, it didn't work on me at all. I stepped on Liu Lin's neck and looked for any allies who could help immediately. My eyes met with Kim Younghoon.

"Brother, can you come over?"

Kim Younghoon, who had just regained his senses, seemed displeased with something he had experienced in the illusion. However, he nodded. I glared at Liu Lin. It seemed he planned to drag his true body here and escape with the core of the formation while we were trapped and unable to return to our true bodies.

"I'll show you that your calculations are wrong."

Kim Younghoon and I exchanged glances and reached out into the air. As our strength gradually returned, we began to connect with our true bodies. Connecting with our true bodies meant we could use qi, and if we could use qi, we could use our consciousness, and if we could use our consciousness...

"Zongtian!"

"Nengguang!"

Using the strike of Zuo Taluo was no big deal! Flash! The world shook, and Kim Younghoon and I each launched our strikes towards the sky. With a dazzling flash of light, we broke free from the formation of Penglai Island and soared upwards, meeting the eyes of Liu Lin's true body under the morning sun of the Yinglong Sea.

Liu Lin's true body, or rather, the direct projection of his true body, looked at us and smirked.

"Aren't you also a projection?"

He mocked me, calling me by the nickname "Tanwang," which was given to me when I was set as a charcoal burner. Kim Younghoon and I silently took our stances. Liu Lin burst into maniacal laughter again. Kim Younghoon sent me a telepathic message.

- Be careful, Eunhyun. This Liu Lin is different from the last time.

Kim Younghoon, who had faced Liu Lin with the Northern Fleet last time, warned me. His face was tense. I swallowed hard.

"Damn... I didn't know the Sea Dragon Clan was such a terrifying race."

Rumble! I could feel it. Although it was a projection, it seemed to be in a state almost identical to the true body through some kind of secret technique, and the power of Liu Lin, who had taken the body of Liu Weng, was...

'On par with Hyun Eum...!'

A combined technique master. He was on par with the Black Dragon King Hyun Eum. And then, the battle began.

"...!"

In an instant, Kim Younghoon and I were trapped in a sphere of water with a diameter of a thousand li. 'This is!' The pressure rose to a terrifying level, and our bodies were about to be crushed. I informed Kim Younghoon of the next attack and moved with him, exchanging telepathic messages.

Flash! Kim Younghoon and I quickly escaped from the inside of the Great Sea Sphere before the magic of three hundred million tons of water density could soak us to death like waterlogged peaches.

"It's coming!"

"Got it!"

Kim Younghoon prepared for the next attack of the Great Sea Sphere as I had informed him through telepathy. Swoosh! The Great Sea Sphere exploded, and each drop of water poured out in all directions. I deflected all the water droplets and flew towards Liu Lin, while Kim Younghoon dodged all the droplets and raised his sword behind Liu Lin's head. In a split second, Liu Lin met my eyes and asked.

"Isn't it tiresome?"

I could feel him smiling at my answer.

"Huh?"

Buzz! A familiar light emanated from his body. 'Damn it...' Kim Younghoon and I quickly retreated after leaving wounds on his neck and back. Liu Lin was about to unleash his domain. His blue scales seemed to glow even more brightly, and in an instant, his body swelled up. Soon, inside Liu Lin's scales, waves like the sea were raging, his eyes became a giant sun and moon, and his mane turned into a storm.

Heavenly cultivators from the Sazhu stage would spread a barrier around themselves and unfold their domain when they reached the combined technique stage, while earthly cultivators from the Sazhu stage would spread a barrier within their bodies, enlarging their physical size, and when they reached the combined technique stage, they would merge their domain with their bodies. In other words, an earthly combined technique master was like a 'living small dimension.' On the contrary, it was unusual for someone like Hyun Eum, who was an earthly cultivator but spread his domain around himself.

Liu Lin, who had become a dimension of Dragon Form, began to move. Whoosh— His first target was Kim Younghoon. His tail aimed at Kim Younghoon. Of course, Kim Younghoon dodged it completely, but his strike shook a quarter of the Yinglong Sea. Rumble! A storm arose in the direction Liu Lin's tail swung, shaking the deep sea and submerging and collapsing the islands in that direction.

Crack! Liu Lin opened his mouth towards Kim Younghoon and me. Buzz! Flash! My Zongtian Sword and his Nengguang Blade shone, and at the same time, Liu Lin's breath, the Dragon Wave, was unleashed from his mouth. Ziiing— In an instant, the world went silent. And I could feel everything behind us in the Yinglong Sea being swept away by his Dragon Wave. Only the area directly behind where Kim Younghoon and I had launched our strikes remained intact.

Kim Younghoon was fast, and I was free. Therefore, in a normal terrain, his attacks would never reach us. However, in the high-pressure environment of the sea, if he launched a wide-range attack that encompassed the entire sea, there would be no place to dodge even if we wanted to. The light faded, and Liu Lin immediately lunged at us, striking down with his front paw. Kim Younghoon dodged and delivered 108 slashes to his body, but the slashes couldn't penetrate the body that had become like a small dimension. They were shallow.

Boom! His paw collided with my Zongtian Sword. Crack! I deflected his strength and grabbed his front paw, flipping Liu Lin over and slamming him into the deep sea. Normally, entering the deep sea would make one a lost soul in the dimension, but Liu Lin, who had become like a small dimension, stood up on the deep sea without sinking, using the characteristic of his body being composed of the same dimensional barrier. And he prepared his Dragon Wave again. Kim Younghoon and I quickly exchanged glances. Using Zuo Taluo's clone could only hinder him, not defeat him. If we met Seo Hyul, he would become Seo Hyul's puppet in less than a day, but as a pure individual Sea Dragon Clan member, Liu Lin was on par with Hyun Eum, or perhaps even stronger due to the compatibility of the high-pressure environment and the Sea Dragon Clan.

Flash! Light began to emanate from his mouth, and the next moment, Kim Younghoon and I simultaneously lunged under Liu Lin's jaw, striking upwards. He was strong. We couldn't deliver a decisive blow to him with just our clones. Moreover, with our true bodies half-trapped by the energy of Penglai Island, we couldn't summon the Three-Talented Formation like we did during the battle with Zhang Yi. So how could we shock him?

Boom! The Dragon Wave he was about to unleash exploded inside his mouth. 'Indeed, martial artists usually defeat cultivators in this way.' We had to make him injure himself with his own power. 'Come to think of it, the Three-Talented Formation was so powerful that I never had to worry about lacking strength against other cultivators.' It was a rather novel experience after a long time. Sizzle— I didn't take my eyes off Liu Lin, who was spewing smoke from his mouth, and retreated to prepare a big strike. Although the Dragon Wave had exploded in his mouth, it seemed that half of the explosive force was circulating back into his internal dimension and being absorbed.

But in that moment. In that brief moment when he was recovering from his injury, we each took our stances and gathered our energy. Buzz! The Zongtian Sword hummed. The Nengguang Blade shone. The next moment, Kim Younghoon became a phoenix that would split the sea. My Zongtian Sword became a storm that would split mountains. And then.

Slash! His left arm was severed by the phoenix, and a hole was pierced in his chest dimension by the storm. He trembled as if in shock. However, a combined technique master wouldn't die unless their entire domain was destroyed. Of course, since he was a projection, it wouldn't matter if his energy was scattered beyond a certain point, but he was using the power of his true body despite being a projection through some kind of secret technique. In other words, he was injured but still fine, while we had exhausted all our energy with the last strike. However, neither Kim Younghoon nor I looked particularly bad.

"This is the limit with just a clone."

"So... shall we fight with our true bodies now, Liu Lin?"

We had stalled for enough time. Our true bodies, which had been in a comatose state, had awakened. I transferred my consciousness to my true body and opened my eyes on my real body above Penglai Island. Kim Younghoon did the same. No, it wasn't just Kim Younghoon and me. Oh Hyunseok, Kim Yeon, Buk Hyanghwa, Jeon Myunghoon, and the entire Wugek Cult had awakened. I looked up at Liu Lin, who was confronting my Zuo Taluo clones in the sky above Penglai Island, and revealed my 19 heads. The Three-Talented Formation rose behind my head.

Crackle! Liu Lin tried to suppress us with gravity. But it was a futile effort. And then, the next moment.

"...Huh?"

I felt the gravitational pull of the ominous force rising into the sky. Rumble! At some point, the palace of Yeomjeong, which had been on Salt Mountain, was being pulled up next to Liu Lin. Upon closer inspection, next to the palace, Jin Mayeol and Liu Lin's projection were each using their unique stealth techniques and the Self-Destruction of Ten Thousand Heavens. Some of the incantations of the Self-Destruction of Ten Thousand Heavens, which I had obtained from Liu Lin's spiritual body, came to mind.

- Purple is the most suitable color for hiding in the darkness.

Jin Mayeol's stealth technique was meaningless in front of me and Kim Younghoon, who had the eyes of Zuo Taluo, but the Self-Destruction of Ten Thousand Heavens complemented his stealth technique, allowing him to hide even in the realm of the soul. Jeon Myunghoon smirked and shouted. And I hurriedly shouted. It was a calamity. Now, a great disaster was rushing towards us like mad!

Crack! Liu Lin's massive body grabbed the palace of Yeomjeong with both hands. A sense of foreboding reached its peak. I could see the joy in Liu Lin's eyes. Buzz! The palace of Yeomjeong began to shine. Infinite white light flowed from the palace of Yeomjeong, creating a white sea in the sky. The white sea gathered in the sky and formed a sphere. Time seemed to stop. Although his actions weren't particularly fast, the pressure from that sphere made my whole body tremble. Not just me, but the entire Wugek Cult's complexion changed, and they couldn't stand properly. Only those who had frequently encountered transcendents like me or had experienced direct divine punishment like Jeon Myunghoon could move.

Crack! Liu Lin compressed the sphere he had created and put it in his mouth. And from Liu Lin's mouth, a blinding flash of light that could split the heavens and earth was unleashed. I overcame the pressure and leaped into the sky, exploding the power of the Three-Talented Formation. Instinctively, I knew. 'I can't completely block it by cutting it.' Techniques like the Single Sword Technique or the Zongtian Sword, which primarily involved cutting, were not suitable for blocking that. So what should I use to block it?

'The Changikcheon Chain lacks firepower.'

The Taesan Yeolje Technique had enough firepower, but it was a technique that trapped and disintegrated the target, making it difficult to use in this situation. In that case...

'There's only one thing to use.'

Swoosh! The seven energies of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements converged into one. The reverse of the Taesan Yeolje Technique, which hadn't even found a proper name yet, was realized in my hand and confronted Liu Lin's Dragon Wave. Crack! Receiving infinite power from the Three-Talented Formation, my reverse cone and Liu Lin's Dragon Wave clashed.
