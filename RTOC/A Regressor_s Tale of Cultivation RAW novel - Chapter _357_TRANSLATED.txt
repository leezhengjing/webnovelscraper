### Ancient Power Realm

Shwaaah! The land of the ghostly creatures, Guangyin Territory, traversed the monochrome path.

‘It seems there are no issues with anyone.’

The path originally served as a route through the deep outskirts of the Underworld. To use this path, one must either master ghostly techniques or possess a dream body created by borrowing the power of the Subordinate Underworld. However, the Wujiao Sect, which had settled in Guangyin Territory, was a sect of ghostly creatures. There was no problem at all in using the path.

Guuuuuu―

The monochrome path was quiet. The sect members also kept their mouths shut, feeling the aura of death emanating from the path. However, even with their mouths closed, it was evident. Everyone was incredibly excited. Though there was almost no sound to be heard, I could see it. The various colors visible in my mind's eye were wildly fluctuating. All the sect members were feeling immense loyalty towards me and a tremendous sense of belonging to the Wujiao Sect. Perhaps it was because they had witnessed me driving out the True Men of the Kaiyeol Sect with their own eyes. Even when I appeared in the form of 'Human Seo Eunhyun' from the form of the Ghost King with 19 heads, no one showed fear or terror towards me. Their loyalty and fervor had grown larger than the fear my appearance might have caused.

‘Thank you all for following me so far.’

I expressed my gratitude to the sect members in my heart and led Guangyin Territory towards the Guanghan Realm with Jeon Myunghun.

“…Hey, Jeon Myunghun.”

It was then.

“Hmm? What is it?”

Currently, I was the one maintaining the path, and Jeon Myunghun, who possessed the power of the Fusion Stage, was steering it. I maintained the path while Jeon Myunghun set the coordinates for the Guanghan Realm and pulled Guangyin Territory with his power. However, I felt something strange.

“Are you driving properly?”

“Of course. We are heading straight for the Guanghan Realm. I set the coordinates for the old site of the Golden Thunder Gate in the Guanghan Realm, so we should come out there. What do you take me for?”

“A clueless guy who hands over driving to someone who stayed up all night because he can't drive?”

“Haha, you called it a path? The scenery is quite nice.”

I clicked my tongue and grabbed his shoulder.

“No, I'm not joking. I'm seriously asking. Are you really pulling towards the coordinates of the Guanghan Realm? Something feels off….”

“What feels off?”

I frowned at the strange sense of incongruity. Jeon Myunghun was definitely pulling towards the site of the Golden Thunder Gate that he remembered. Since it was an unforgettable coordinate for him, there was no worry about the coordinates being wrong. But strangely, even though we were heading towards the 'correct' coordinates, it felt like we were on the 'wrong' path.

‘Why? The direction is correct, but it feels like we are taking a different route.’

I checked Jeon Myunghun's power several times to confirm that he was going the right way. His power was indeed connected to the old site of the Golden Thunder Gate in the Guanghan Realm.

‘This is strange….’

We were going the right way but felt wrong. It was a really strange feeling, but that was the reality. It was then.

Wooooong!

“…!?”

I suddenly felt the Colorless Glass Sword in my stomach heating up.

‘What is this?’

The Colorless Glass Sword was vibrating.

“Stop crying, Colorless Glass Sword!”

I tried to suppress the vibration by taking out the Colorless Glass Sword with my mouth, but it was immovable. The sword continued to vibrate and emit a faint light.

‘This light…?’

I was startled and looked at the light. It was the light of the technique that reversed the Taesan Yeolje Technique. The light I had just used to drive away the True Men! 

‘Did using this technique affect the Colorless Glass Sword somehow?’

As I looked at the Colorless Glass Sword emitting a white, grain-like light, it was then.

Wiiing!

“…!”

I realized that the fog of the All-Connections Diagram embedded in the Colorless Glass Sword was also vibrating.

‘No, what is this…!’

I was flustered.

“Wait! Jeon Myunghun! Where are you driving!?”

“What? I'm driving fine!”

“Damn it! We're going the wrong way!”

“What are you talking about? Can't you see we're going to the fixed coordinates?”

“No, damn it!”

Jeon Myunghun suddenly went crazy, turning from the straight path to a strange direction. I was horrified, but Jeon Myunghun looked at me with a puzzled expression.

“How is this straight? We were just there, and now where are we going?”

“No! I can't see front or back, so I'm just following the power!”

“Damn it…!”

Jeon Myunghun, not as deep in death as I was, couldn't see the path well, but it was vividly clear to me. This guy suddenly turned to a strange place.

“Fine! I'll set the direction, so just follow me.”

“Well, okay….”

Kugugugugu!

It was then.

“What…!”

Suddenly, the Colorless Glass Sword started vibrating madly. At the same time, Guangyin Territory, which was slowly moving forward, began to be pulled forward 'madly.'

“Damn it! What's happening!?”

“I don't know either!”

I felt that something terrible would happen if we continued like this, so I tried to cut off the power somehow, and Jeon Myunghun surrounded Guangyin Territory with his domain according to my instructions. I could feel it. 'Something' was pulling us.

‘Could it be the True Men of the Kaiyeol Sect?’

It was possible. One of the enraged True Men might have come to the path to devour us! I raised the energy of the Taesan Yeolje Technique with a tense face. It was then.

“…!”

Ahead, I saw a dimensional barrier. If we continued like this, Guangyin Territory would crash into the dimensional barrier and be crushed!

Woooong!

I covered the front of Guangyin Territory with the Total Heaven Sword.

‘Pierce through!’

The next moment.

Kwaaang!

The force of Guangyin Territory, the sharpness of the Total Heaven Sword, and the speed at which we were being pulled combined to create an enormous explosion, and Guangyin Territory entered this suspicious dimension.

### Ancient Power Realm

Seongran Island in the Suryu Region.

Seongran Island, located in the middle of a vast ocean, was a prosperous place. It was one of the trade cities where trade frequently occurred with other islands, and it was also a place rich in spiritual veins, preventing major conflicts. 

Yookyo, a silk carp demon and resident of Seongran Island, woke up inside his domain, the Deungnyeong Waterfall, shook his body once, and then jumped into the waterfall, ascending to the sky against the current.

Kugugugugu!

Once he ascended the waterfall, Yookyo transformed into a divine blue dragon. Although he hadn't actually become a dragon, he used his unique mystic arts to transform similarly.

“Hmm, today is another great day. Let's find another fool to swindle today.”

Although he was still at the early stage of the Origin Realm, Yookyo flew to the harbor of Seongran Island with a confident expression. As he arrived at the harbor, he heard people clicking their tongues.

“That scammer is at it again.”

“Instead of training hard to become a real dragon, he goes around scamming people with his cheap transformation arts.”

“Only the victims suffer. Tsk tsk….”

Ignoring the murmurs, Yookyo, in his dragon form, performed a half-transformation, with his head as a dragon and his body as a human. Despite the mixed form, it looked quite dignified, making it seem plausible. As he wandered around the harbor, he noticed a newly arrived ship and approached it with gleaming eyes. Several demon beasts were unloading goods from the ship, and other demon beasts, seemingly from another island, were looking around. Yookyo approached a naive-looking demon beast at the Celestial Human Stage. The demon beast, fully transformed into a human form, seemed to be visiting Seongran Island for the first time, nervously biting his lips.

“Haha, hello, fellow cultivator. Is this your first time on Seongran Island?”

“Ah… Yes, it is. I came to attend the auction being held on Seongran Island….”

“Ah, you mean the Seongran Trade Fair. The Seongran Trade Fair is in five days, so why not look around Seongran Island until then? As a local, I can guide you well.”

“Oh, there's no need for a noble dragon to do that.”

“Haha, it's nothing. I've always enjoyed making friends from outside the island. Please give me the opportunity.”

“Haha, if a noble dragon insists….”

The demon beast, seemingly persuaded by Yookyo's dignified dragon face, began to follow him. Yookyo quickly became friends with the Celestial Human Stage demon beast using his unique charm and eloquence.

“Really? As expected of Sister Yook! To subdue a demon beast of the Sacrificial Beast Stage with a single command!”

“Hmm, that one was nothing. The real terror was the King of the Fusion Stage. His strike was truly formidable. My cultivation fell to this level because I had to withstand his ultimate move.”

“To think you survived an encounter with a King of the Fusion Stage! Truly admirable, Sister Yook!”

Yookyo continued to boast and chat with the demon beast, and at some point, he took out a small piece of paper from his sleeve.

“By the way, brother, I'm planning to start a business recently. If I do it under my name, it will be incredibly profitable. So, brother, could you lend me ten ancient stones? I'll return them a hundredfold.”

“Really? If it's you, Sister, I could sell all my possessions to give you a hundred ancient stones!”

“Oh no! Even between close siblings, we shouldn't casually trade wealth. It would be heartbreaking if our bond were to be strained. Just ten stones will do.”

“Ah… As expected of a noble dragon, Sister! Truly admirable!”

Yookyo took the ten shining stones from the moved demon beast.

“Ah, I just remembered I left something at the other harbor. Wait here for a moment, brother. I'll be right back.”

“Yes, Sister!”

Yookyo disappeared somewhere, leaving the demon beast behind, who continued to wait with an excited face. But Yookyo did not return.

“…? That's strange. Why isn't Sister coming back?”

It was then.

“Hey, young man. Are you waiting for a dignified-looking dragon?”

“Yes… I am.”

“Tsk tsk… You've been scammed.”

“What…?”

“That guy is a notorious scammer around here. He transforms into a dragon and scams newcomers to Seongran Island. He's very elusive, so it's hard to catch him. Just think of it as bad luck.”

“No, what do you mean? Sister Yook is a former member of the Sacrificial Beast Stage, almost at the Fusion Stage, a quasi-King. Why would she scam someone like me at the Celestial Human Stage?”

“Tsk tsk. My friend, that scammer is not at the Sacrificial Beast Stage. He's a demon beast at the Origin Realm. He can't even perform transformation arts properly, being at the early stage of the Origin Realm.”

“….”

“Poor guy. Tsk tsk….”

The passerby patted the demon beast's shoulder and left, stealthily taking the demon beast's paper from his waist. The demon beast stood there in a daze, only realizing much later that his paper had been stolen, and let out a furious roar.

“Huaaaaaa!!!”

Kureung, Kurururung!

At another harbor on Seongran Island, Yookyo laughed as he saw the storm caused by the enraged Celestial Human Stage demon beast from afar.

“Welcome to the island of thieves, rookie. Acting so foolishly, you were bound to fall for this old man's trick. Hehe… Now, what should I buy with these ancient stones today….”

Yookyo laughed as he looked at the ten stones in his hand. The transformation art he had learned, the Dragon Form Transformation Art, had some side effects, but it allowed him to transform almost perfectly into a dragon he had seen before. He had used this art several times to scam people on Seongran Island, and today he had scored another hit. As he reveled in his success, it was then.

Kureung, Kurururung!

The sky suddenly began to darken.

“Hmm? What's that? Is someone advancing?”

Yookyo looked up at the sky with a puzzled expression. The sky was darkening, and dark clouds were gathering.

‘No, this feels….’

Yookyo broke into a cold sweat as he saw the unstable movement of the heavenly energy. The heavenly energy was conveying a strong sense of foreboding.

‘Isn't the yin energy becoming too strong?’

The balance of yin and yang was breaking, and the heavenly energy, which had been flowing well, was rapidly tilting towards the yin side. And then.

Kwaaang!

An enormous explosion sounded, and the sky shattered like pottery.

“What, what!”

He froze in place, terrified. The next moment.

Kyaaaaaa!

Kyaaaaa!

Kyaaaak!

Terrifying ghostly wails echoed throughout the entire ocean, and countless ghosts began to emerge from the cracks.

Kurururung!

As if thunder was roaring, a monster with six arms crawled out of the crack. The giant roared in a strange language, and six shadows below it summoned black thunder, forcibly widening the crack. The giant threw the black thunder like hooks into the crack, pulling something from inside.

Kwaaang!

The next moment.

Kugugugugu!

A massive landmass large enough to cover Seongran Island emerged from the crack.

Ooooooo―

Aaaaaa―

Kyaaaaaa!

Terrifying ghostly wails echoed. Yookyo looked up at the sky. On top of the landmass were numerous buildings emitting dreadful yin energy, and between the buildings, grotesque cursed dolls were kneeling and praying towards the sky.

“What, what is that…!”

As Yookyo's mind went blank, the residents of Seongran Island, sensing the danger, transformed into their true forms and began to flee. Yookyo, seeing them, finally came to his senses.

‘Damn it, this is no time to be standing around. I need to get off this island!’

He turned pale and tried to undo his transformation and flee, but his speed was slower than that of the cultivators at the Decision Stage.

‘Damn it! I can't move fast because of the Dragon Form Transformation Art!’

The Dragon Form Transformation Art he had learned allowed him, a silk carp demon, to transform into a noble dragon, but at the cost of reduced speed and physical strength. Although it was a mystic art with a price, it allowed him to mimic the aura of a dragon almost perfectly. However….

‘Damn it! Undo it! Undo it!’

To undo the Dragon Form Transformation Art, Yookyo needed considerable time. He had to sit still and concentrate for at least one hour to undo the transformation. Yookyo tried to undo the transformation while fleeing, but it was then.

Yookyo felt a prickling sensation on the back of his head and turned around, feeling like he was about to die. The giant with six arms, standing among the ghosts, was staring directly at Yookyo.

Thud!

The giant reached out towards him. At the same time, a massive force pulled Yookyo towards it.

“Huaaaaaa!!!”

Yookyo screamed and struggled, but he couldn't escape and was eventually caught by the giant.

* * *

“Bring him here.”

I sat in front of the Wujiao Sect's main hall, looking out at the endless ocean, and spoke. Thud, thud, thud, thud! Jeon Myunghun, in the form of a giant, dragged a demon beast that looked like a dragon in front of me. I looked down at the demon beast with cold eyes. The demon beast was shouting noisily in the demon beast language, but it was useless as the ghostly creatures of the Underworld had their own language. I spoke to the demon beast in the demon beast language.

“Calm down. I won't eat you. First, explain where we are.”

The demon beast trembled and spoke.

“This, this is Seongran Island in the Suryu Region, sir. Please, spare me! As you can see from my energy, I'm just a weak cultivator at the Decision Stage!”

“…Suryu Region? Where is that? Is it in the An Realm or the Nan Realm?”

“Y-Yes? Of course, it's in the An Realm.”

“Since it's a place with demon beasts, it must be in the Ji Realm… How far is it to the True Dragon Alliance from here?”

But the demon beast asked back, seemingly not understanding.

“The True Dragon Alliance? What do you mean by that? Where is that?”

“….”

I realized something was wrong from the demon beast's reaction.

‘As expected… Did Jeon Myunghun mess up the driving?’

It seemed we hadn't fallen into the Guanghan Realm.

“Where is this… So, what is the name of this world? We just came from the Underworld, so explain it to us.”

At the mention of coming from the Underworld, the demon beast trembled and began to speak.

“This, this is the Ancient Power Realm, sir. But why are beings from the Underworld here….”

Baekrin, who had recently joined as a Guardian Ghost King, shouted angrily next to the demon beast. Although he couldn't speak the demon beast language, he seemed to understand from the tone that the demon beast was asking a question. The demon beast looked like it was about to faint from fear as Baekrin, who was nothing but bones, shouted. Hongbeom, standing next to me, translated the demon beast's words into the Underworld language.

“He said to keep your mouth shut unless asked.”

The demon beast rolled its eyes and closed its mouth. I sighed.

‘Damn it… We ended up in the Ancient Power Realm!’

The distance between the Ancient Power Realm and the Guanghan Realm was a thousand years. Although we could return much faster with Jeon Myunghun's help now that he had reached the Fusion Stage, it would still take considerable time to bring the entire Wujiao Sect back.

‘How did this happen….’

I sighed.

“Great Protector, summon the Elder through the Connection Array.”

In any case, we needed the Elder's wisdom.

“And you there….”

I asked the trembling demon beast in front of me.

“That form, it's not your true form, is it?”

“Y-Yes! That's correct, sir. This is a mystic art I learned that allows me to transform into a dragon I've seen before!”

“Oh, I see.”

I looked at him with shining eyes and asked.

“Then
