### Return to Cultivation (Chapter 400): Along with the Wind (3)

Focusing my mind, I imbued the sword with my intent. Deep within the mountains of Dosan Sword Forest, only one sword shone. That sword was heavily damaged. Reflected on its blade was the image of an inexperienced swordsman in white. Beyond the transparent blade, a crude three-taiji symbol was visible. It was still incomplete and had the flaw of exploding midway when deployed, so it was not used. However, now, I decided it was time to use this nameless technique.

The treasure hunt that had taken hostages between us was meaningless. The thirty-first technique of the Danak Sword Technique, which begins with the opening move of Yueak, was as follows. Like the thirtieth technique, Sansimyeonhudo, it places three moves that shift ranks at the forefront. Starting with the horizontal slash of Yueak, it unfolds a move that elevates the sword from a lower rank to a higher rank. Then, it transitions to a downward slash, deploying Sansimyeonhudo as the second move. Immediately after, it thrusts with a strike from the soul's rank, unleashing the third move, Zuatallipmang. Thus, after unifying all ranks touched by my sword in three actions, the thirty-first technique begins from there.

The cultivation of the Celestial Race elevates to the rank of the name. The cultivation of the Earthly Race raises oneself from the rank of qi. The realm of the Heart Race roams freely in the rank of the soul. I imbue the path of cultivation I have experienced into the sword path. Through the first, second, and third moves, I connect and link all the techniques of the Danak Sword Technique. The first move mimics the realms of the Celestial Race, rising from a lower rank to a higher rank, imitating the realms of smoke, accumulation, decision, original spirit, celestial being, and four accumulations. The second move mimics the realms of the Earthly Race, striking from a higher rank to a lower rank and causing an explosion. The third move was just the martial arts I had practiced so far.

Following the horizontal slash, vertical slash, and thrust of the first, second, and third moves, I consecutively deployed the 22-move Danak three times, pushing through 66 moves. Then, I activated the linkage between the 66 moves. After activating the linkage, I melted all my techniques, spells, and puppet circuits into the first, second, and third moves. This was the still incomplete thirty-first technique of the Danak Sword Technique.

Tsuahhhhh— The swords connected infinitely, spewing a hazy mist. It contained my history in the sword path, revealing the effect of the All-Phenomena Connection Sword. Each droplet of mist was a powerful force that had reached the extreme. Qi was consumed immensely, and my clone flickered as if it would vanish. However, the mist began to rotate in the form of a three-taiji. The celestial and earthly energies were drawn in. Jinmayeol's eyes wavered. The three-taiji rotated. The hazy mist formed a fierce vortex.

Kugwagwagwagwa! The aftermath alone split the treasure mountain of Yukrin, and Yukrin's shell turned to powder and vanished. The final move of the thirty-first technique was to unify this three-taiji into one and implement the strike of Fentian, which would divide heaven and earth. And the three-taiji unified. The hazy mist was dyed in a pure white light. In the next moment.

Kwa-gwa-gwang! My technique twisted as if it were alive and exploded. Unable to control the explosive force, I was flung backward with it. But in the last moment, I concentrated the explosive force on Jinmayeol's right hand. And then.

Kwaching— Finally, the sword of power in his hand was flung away. Chiiii— My entire body became faint as if it would vanish. Was Yukrin's shell serving as a pillar for some illusionary formation? As his shell turned to powder, the illusionary formation trembled and collapsed. The scenery of the otherworld that had overlapped with this space disappeared, and the thin qi returned to its original state. However, the clash just now was clearly to my detriment. If I had concentrated the explosion more on Jinmayeol's body, I could have ground his upper body to dust, but seeing his eyes at the last moment, I deliberately took some of the explosive force onto myself.

Chiiii— Drawing in the celestial and earthly energies, he regenerated the wounds on his body. In contrast, my body was faint, unable to overcome the aftermath of the explosion. The celestial and earthly energies were returning, so I would recover slowly, but at this rate, I would lose to Jinmayeol. However, Jinmayeol did not immediately pounce on this good opportunity. He bit his lip and looked at me.

"...What was that just now?" "I haven't named it yet." "I'm not asking for a name...! How did you combine the realm of cultivation and martial arts...!" His eyes trembled like an aspen tree. "How did you do it! Tell me!" Kugugugugu! As he shouted, the entire deep sea beyond Yukrin's treasure vault shook. I looked at Jinmayeol and laughed. "You can do it too." "What nonsense is that...?" "What have you been wielding in your hand?" "What?" "What have you been swinging all this time?" At my shout, Jinmayeol was stunned and trembled. I raised my exhausted body and asked, "What is the name of what you wield?" "...The martial arts of the second rank of the martial path..." "I asked, what is the name of what you wield!!!!!" Clearly, Jinmayeol had the advantage in qi. He also had the advantage in stamina. If we clashed now, he would quickly destroy my clone and take all the treasures here. However, Jinmayeol, instead of attacking, looked as if he wanted to hide in a mouse hole, avoiding my eyes and lowering his gaze.

"...I don't know." "Raise your sword." He looked at the sword of power that had been flung from his hand for a moment, then clenched his lips and unfolded the monstrous sword that transformed his hand. "I'll ask again. What is in your hand?" "...." He lowered his head. The thought of shame was evident in his mind.

* * *

The Battle Ghost Tribe thrives on combat. Therefore, they grow and elevate their ranks faster than anyone else through battle, becoming the finest warriors of any race. They clash with other races, mimicking their physiques, endlessly indulging in ecstasy and madness until they die fighting. That is the Battle Ghost Tribe. Jinmayeol was born as a Battle Ghost and lived that way until now. He entered the first rank of the martial path through the traditional ritual of the Battle Ghost Tribe, and a few hundred years ago, he fought the 'Conquering King' of the Power Realm, gaining inspiration to enter the second rank of the martial path. The second rank of the martial path was something that even the most talented among the Battle Ghost royalty might or might not reach, so Jinmayeol's confidence soared. Now he was superior to any Battle Ghost! If he lived long enough, he was confident he could reach the fourth rank of the martial path, which the founder of the martial path had reached. It felt like the world was in his grasp. He could already see the ultimate martial path in his mind. His life had never stopped. Small obstacles had blocked him, but he always believed he could overcome them as he had before.

But.

"...I don't know." Jinmayeol lowered his eyes in front of a human swordsman he had looked down upon. His whole body trembled. The beautiful sword dance he had just seen still lingered before his eyes. They say if your rank is too low, you can't recognize the moves of someone of a higher rank. But Jinmayeol's rank was the second rank of the martial path. He had the insight to some extent, and it wasn't a low rank, so he could partially understand the enlightenment contained in the sword dance he had just seen. It was immature. There seemed to be many points to improve, and it was clear that the man in front of him couldn't control his sword path. The sword technique exploded because he couldn't control it, which was laughable. But Jinmayeol couldn't laugh. Because the moment he saw that sword, he realized that the martial arts he had learned were even more trash.

The sword technique that started with three moves was elegant. It was the murmuring of countless crowds, the misery of clumsily integrating the celestial and earthly minds. At the same time, it was the immaturity of a novice swordsman and a piece of trash. However, the murmuring within the sword constantly discussed the direction the sword should go. The misery continuously developed the sword. The immaturity refined the trashy sword path through reflection. A sword containing infinite possibilities. That was the sword the man in front of him had displayed. And when the man who showed that beautiful possibility asked a question Jinmayeol had never considered, Jinmayeol felt an indescribable sense of shame.

Shame. Why? The Battle Ghost Tribe only learned martial arts, not bothering with names. To them, martial arts were just one of the ways to enjoy mating in a different manner. Everyone thought so, so Jinmayeol never considered naming martial arts. It was natural. But now, the sword in front of him reached a realm that couldn't be reached by mere naturalness. Discussing naturalness in front of that sword was an act of making himself trash. 'Am I trash...?' Jinmayeol, the confident leader of the Battle Ghost Tribe, fell into despair for the first time in his life, trembling all over. He looked so small in front of that sword. He wanted to cry. Holding a sword had always been joyful, but now it wasn't. He wanted to hide anywhere. But he couldn't hide.

"I'll ask again. What is in your hand?" He was asking! He had to answer that question. If he didn't, he knew he would remain trash forever. An eternity passed in a moment. Jinmayeol chose and chose his words. Finally, he said the 'name' of what was in his hand, feeling like he would vomit from the shameful emotion.

"...Lust." Yes. What he had been wielding, no, what 99.9% of the Battle Ghost Tribe wielded was that. "No... Instinct. Yes, this is instinct." At Jinmayeol's answer, the man in front of him nodded. "Yes. That's right." "...." As expected, hearing a direct affirmation made Jinmayeol feel nauseous. It felt like the entire history of the Battle Ghost Tribe was being denied. They had always believed their martial arts were superior. But they weren't. Their martial arts were just the instincts of the Battle Ghost Tribe. He looked at his sword with a dazed expression and asked, "...Then, is martial arts wrong?" And he answered. "Maybe." "Then...!" "Or maybe not." Jinmayeol's pupils contracted at his words. "Now that you know what you've been wielding, think about how you'll wield it from now on." "...!" Was it because he was at a higher rank and could read Jinmayeol's mind clearly? Or was it because his sword was so poor that it was obvious how to advise him? Jinmayeol gritted his teeth at his advice. And he raised his monstrous sword. "...I'll swing it once." He nodded. In the next moment, the two warriors clashed. Jinmayeol, with the power of a combined technique, and the Heart Race at the fourth rank of the martial path collided. But there was no explosion. No shockwave. Jinmayeol's monstrous sword was simply cut cleanly. No, it wasn't just his sword that was cut. His upper body, his domain, was entirely sliced off. Until just now, when he fought with the sword of power, they had matched each other to some extent. Their ranks seemed similar. At least, Jinmayeol thought so.

Thud! Jinmayeol, who had sat down on the mountain of treasures, was defeated in one move. It was a bitter defeat. However, a peaceful smile, which he had never shown even during 'mating,' appeared on his face. "...Thank you." He was defeated. The treasures of the Palace of Flames, the treasures of Yukrin's vault, and the unparalleled divine sword of power would all belong to Seo Eunhyun. But it didn't matter. He could see the next rank. The third rank of the martial path, which no one in the Battle Ghost Tribe had reached for tens of thousands of years, seemed within reach. That was enough. 'The next... rank... is in sight....' His vision blurred. His consciousness scattered. His body grew cold. It was a different ending from what Jinmayeol had hoped for, but he smiled. He had exhausted all his resurrection chances and failed to obtain the perfect self-soul, so his goal of immortality was out of reach, but it didn't matter. He had learned the joy of what Seo Eunhyun called martial arts. Thus, Jinmayeol, the leader of the Battle Ghost Tribe and the captain of the Battle Ghost Pirates, died.

* * *

From the first time I met him, he was an unpleasant guy. Originally, when I deployed the thirty-first technique, I intended to kill him completely with the explosive force. But at the last moment, his eyes changed from those of a beast to those of a warrior. So, as a fellow warrior, I took the force upon myself and gave him a chance. And Jinmayeol, though he attacked like a beast, died as a warrior. I looked at Jinmayeol's corpse for a moment, then swung the Total Sword. Kugugugugu! The mountain of treasures and rocks above him poured down. Buried in the golden treasures, the warrior Jinmayeol completely disappeared from the world.
