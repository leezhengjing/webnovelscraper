### Return to Cultivation (회귀수선전) Chapter 376: At Sea (4)

**Crunch!** 

Kim Yeon crushed Bukhyanghwa's handcuffs and asked, "By the way... do you think what we're doing will be detected in the consciousness realm?"

Bukhyanghwa clicked her tongue and replied, "Did you not think about that before freeing me?"

"Ugh... I just had a gut feeling it would be okay."

"Well, you're not wrong. After all, the Salt Crystal Lake is like a massive nation inside, similar to the Submerged Abyss. Plus, the waves emitted by the Salt Crystal restrict the consciousness realm quite a bit, so they won't notice what we're doing."

"Hehe, I knew what I was doing."

"Stop talking nonsense and help me, sister."

Bukhyanghwa loosened her fingers and placed her hand on the wall of the ship. **Crackle—** Golden patterns and a mix of purple and light pink patterns appeared all over her body.

"What, are you walking around with tattoos now?"

"They're not tattoos; they're body features."

"Oh, sorry..."

Kim Yeon scratched her head and bowed slightly. Bukhyanghwa watched her for a moment before starting to move her hands. Using the broken handcuff pieces as materials, she created a small tool. With that as a start, numerous pieces of equipment began to appear around Bukhyanghwa. Initially yawning while watching Bukhyanghwa, Kim Yeon's eyes widened as time passed.

"What on earth is this...?"

---

**Rumble!**

In a small sea area of the High Power Realm, a demon king with 19 heads and his subordinates appeared.

"Is this the place?"

"Yes."

The demon king with 19 heads, Muguk Demon King Seo Eunhyun, connected a white consciousness thread to the sea below and his eyes gleamed.

"Down there, I can sense the Peculiar Demon King Kim Yeon. Surely, the Conqueror King Bukhyanghwa and the Guardian Demon King Baeklin must be there too."

"So, we just need to go down and come back?"

The Thunder God with six arms, Yukguk Demon King Jeon Myunghun, asked. However, Seo Eunhyun shook his head.

"According to the locals, it's dangerous to recklessly dive into the deep sea of the High Power Realm. Moreover, Kim Yeon is sensed not in the coastal area but in the very deep sea."

"Then what do you plan to do?"

Jeon Myunghun looked puzzled, and Seo Eunhyun chuckled, spreading his arms wide. **Rumble!** The nearby heavenly and earthly energy began to gather towards Seo Eunhyun due to his Great Demonic Sea Star.

"What do you think I'm going to do?"

**Buzz!** He drew his Colorless Glass Sword and laughed. As his voice echoed, all the executives of the Muguk Sect who came with Seo Eunhyun began to exert their power. Jeon Myunghun grinned and spread his six arms. **Rumble!** Jeon Myunghun's domain unfolded. **Combined Path Domain (合道領域). Charged Thunderstorm (荷電蔽雷大雨天).** **Crackle!** In an instant, the surrounding space transformed into an alien world where red thunder rained down like a torrential downpour. The red thunder covered the sky! However, following Jeon Myunghun's will, the red thunder passed through his allies without affecting them and fell to the bottom.

**Rumble!** The domain of falling red thunder began to push away the sea of the lower dimension. Then, other executives of the Muguk Sect began to exert their power towards it.

**Boom!** Countless forces of attraction, demonic energy, or magic poured out. And, curses and blessings began to dwell in Seo Eunhyun's hands. The energy of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements began to dwell in the dimension's sea where the thunder fell.

**Flash!** A white light began to swirl.

---

Jin Mayeol's eyes twitched. **Rumble!** His Salt Crystal Lake was shaking violently. **Flash!** Someone used a teleportation technique to rush into the captain's cabin where Jin Mayeol was. It was Jin Ryu, the vice-captain of the Salt Crystal Lake and a member of the ship's crew.

"What is it, vice-captain? An enemy attack?"

"No, captain! The Salt Crystal Lake has gone mad!"

"What?"

"The dragon bone of the Salt Crystal is shaking wildly and making strange noises!"

"What nonsense is that!?"

However, after moving to the dragon bone part of the ship with Jin Ryu, Jin Mayeol understood what it meant. **Buzz!** The dragon bone of the Salt Crystal Lake, made of salt crystals, was making a sound similar to that of a mating call of a noble demon. Jin Mayeol looked at the salt crystal emitting white light and strange noises with a bewildered expression.

"Why on earth is this happening!?"

Jin Mayeol was flustered. Despite living for about 10,000 years, he had never heard of salt crystals making such bizarre noises. After being flustered for a moment, he seemed to think of something and shuddered.

"I see. Is it a deep-sea monster?"

"Are there deep-sea monsters that can arouse salt crystals?"

"Well, the deep sea of the High Power Realm is filled with countless records of the world, so such things could exist... Since there might be a deep-sea monster nearby, I will activate the Great Concealment Technique. Tell everyone to prepare."

"Yes, captain!"

Jin Mayeol clicked his tongue and moved back to the captain's cabin. Sitting in the center of the large formation in the captain's cabin, he began to form hand seals. **Buzz!** His domain began to spread around. As his formation activated, it amplified Jin Mayeol's domain, covering the entire Salt Crystal Lake. **Combined Path Domain (合道領域). Great Concealment Dragon Spirit Sea (大隱龍靈海).** For a moment, the sound of a dragon's roar was heard, and Jin Mayeol's domain quickly covered the ship, blending the Salt Crystal Lake with the surrounding deep-sea scenery, making it hard for anyone to notice.

Jin Mayeol sat down, focusing on his domain, and sent a telepathic message throughout the ship.

"This is the captain's order. It is presumed that a suspicious deep-sea monster is near the Salt Crystal Lake. Because of this, the dragon bone of the Salt Crystal Lake is making strange noises. We will cover the ship with the concealment domain until the deep-sea monster completely passes and the dragon bone's reaction disappears, so everyone must remain quiet..."

As Jin Mayeol was sending the telepathic message, he suddenly stopped speaking and closed his mouth. After sitting and focusing for a while, Jin Mayeol's eyes widened.

"Damn it, the prisoners are up to something! Everyone, go to the cells and subdue them!"

The domains of those who have reached the level of Grandmasters are integrated with their consciousness, so if one is a Grandmaster, they can perceive all actions within their domain. And Jin Mayeol, who covered the Salt Crystal Lake with his domain, gritted his teeth as he saw Kim Yeon and Bukhyanghwa doing suspicious things in the cells.

"Damn it, Conqueror King...!"

He wanted to get up immediately and subdue them, but he couldn't move recklessly while the suspicious deep-sea monster was stimulating the dragon bone of the Salt Crystal Lake, so he could only bite his lip.

---

Vice-captain Jin Ryu led his subordinates with a disinterested expression towards the lower deck where the cells were.

"All of them are boring, there's no point in fighting them."

The Conqueror King and the Peculiar Demon King were experts in puppet control. Therefore, the pirate crew members who fought them had to fight against puppets, and for the noble demons who could only satisfy their desires by fighting and mingling with their opponents, puppet masters were not attractive opponents. The only one who caught Jin Ryu's interest was the demon king Baeklin, whom they fought when capturing them, but Baeklin was a demon, so he couldn't mate with anyone other than another demon. In other words, the members of the Muguk Sect were all uninteresting and meaningless opponents for the noble demons.

"Puppet masters, what nonsense is that! In my time, puppet masters used puppets only as support and fought themselves as true warriors, but nowadays, all puppet masters are just weirdos!"

Jin Ryu cursed Kim Yeon and Bukhyanghwa, who used puppets as their main force, as he entered the cell area. And what Jin Ryu saw in the cell area were thousands of complex mechanical devices.

"What on earth is this...?"

**Clank, clank, clank...** 

Before he knew it, their cell area had been transformed into a bizarre labyrinth. The labyrinth stretched out in a straight line, but at a glance, it was filled with powerful-looking mechanical devices and weapons, and countless grotesque puppets were lined up in between. And at the end of the labyrinth, Kim Yeon was standing with a sinister smile, her arms hanging down. Threads of consciousness extended from her fingertips, connecting to numerous puppets, and behind Kim Yeon, Bukhyanghwa, who had equipped herself with spider-like puppet equipment, was continuously modifying the area.

Jin Ryu chuckled and said, "Conqueror King and Peculiar Demon King. I've heard of the fame of you two humans, but I didn't expect it to be this much. But it's useless. If you surrender now, I'll just put you back in your cells quietly, but if you resist, I'll tear off your limbs and restrain you."

However, Kim Yeon silently moved one finger. **Buzz!** **Flash!** And three mass-produced General Seo puppets, modified by Kim Yeon and taught by Seo Eunhyun, fired beams from their mouths.

**Boom!** Jin Ryu, who was at the level of a Grandmaster, took the beams from the mass-produced General Seo puppets and twitched his eyes, taking a step forward.

"Well, fine. If you insist on drinking the punishment wine, I'll oblige."

**Boom!** 

Noble demons were almost indistinguishable from humans in appearance. The difference was that noble demons were born with well-developed muscles all over their bodies, and as they grew, their muscles swelled up, and horns grew on their foreheads. The more horns they had, the more talented they were considered among the noble demons, and those with fewer horns were treated very poorly even among the noble demons. The royal family of the noble demons had seven horns, the highest nobles had five to six, the middle nobles had four, the lower nobles had three, commoners had one or two, and slaves had their horns removed, so they had none. The captain of the Demon Pirate Crew, Jin Mayeol, was a high noble with five horns, and the vice-captain, Jin Ryu, was a middle noble with four horns.

**Buzz!** Jin Ryu's horns trembled, and his muscles began to tense up. **Boom, boom!** Jin Ryu, with a disinterested expression, began to walk through the labyrinth, smashing the puppets that rushed at him. The distance between Jin Ryu and Kim Yeon and Bukhyanghwa gradually began to close. Kim Yeon looked at Baeklin lying next to her. Baeklin had just been released from his restraints, so it would take time for his power to recover.

"How much longer, Buk?"

"Almost done, sister. And please call me by my proper name!"

"Got it, got it."

"Ugh...!"

Kim Yeon chuckled and focused her mind on the threads of consciousness extending from her fingertips.

—Listen well, my disciple. 

It felt as if the madman who taught her the Peculiar Heart Technique and puppet control, the Peculiar Lord, was speaking to her from the side.

—Why do you think the Peculiar Fortress wins every battle against its enemies?

A strange madness began to appear in her eyes.

—Is it simply because we crush them with superior technology and numbers? Well, that's part of it. But the most important thing is this! Madness! Those who fight against our Peculiar Fortress, whether they realize it or not, gradually become infected with the 'heart' of the Peculiar Fortress during the battle. In other words, those who fight us gradually open up the possibility of 'evolution'!!

**Boom, boom, boom!** 

Jin Ryu, who was smashing the General Seo puppets with an expressionless face, began to twitch his face.

—Yes, my Peculiar Fortress is... 'love'! The 'love' that leads everyone to a new world! The ultimate embodiment of [philanthropy]! Ah, how could I have created such a magnificent work!?

Those who fought against the puppets of the Peculiar Fortress, as they smashed the puppets and fought them, gradually became imprinted with the circuits of the Peculiar Fortress in their subconscious. The more they fought against the Peculiar Fortress, the more they lost their sanity and went mad. And if both sides went mad, the side that had been accustomed to the madness for a longer time, the Peculiar Lord's side, would inevitably win.

**Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch...** 

Kim Yeon began to bite her lips furiously. Blood started to flow from her lips, and Jin Ryu, who had been smashing the General Seo puppets, began to show signs of excitement and madness on his face.

"Heh, haha! Hehahaha!"

Jin Ryu laughed. It was the same when they captured the Peculiar Demon King before. Fighting against puppets wasn't enjoyable. But when fighting Kim Yeon's puppets, at some point, he would get excited.

"Hehihahaha!!!"

**Buzz!** **Crackle!** Jin Ryu's horns trembled and made strange noises. Jin Ryu's face turned red. The muscles all over Jin Ryu's body began to swell even more. Before he knew it, Jin Ryu's eyes began to see the faces of General Seo and Jin Mayeol overlapping.

"Captain! Captain! Captaiiiin! Ahhh! Brother Jin Mayeol!!!"

Jin Ryu, with a red face, began to beat General Seo furiously.

"Heh, heh! Hehahaha!"

Even as he fell into madness, Jin Ryu approached Kim Yeon, trying to hold onto his sanity.

'Ah... I'm on the verge of going berserk.'

Jin Ryu sighed inwardly. This was why noble demons hated fighting puppet masters. Even if they thought they had enjoyed themselves thoroughly, when they came to their senses, what remained was not the flesh of their opponent but the hard pieces of puppets. Remembering that they had fought puppets after coming to their senses brought not satisfaction and joy, but extreme self-loathing and discomfort. However, Jin Ryu sighed and swung his fist as he saw the puppets rushing at him.

'Whatever, whether it's a tool or whatever, who cares. Let's just enjoy it and think later.'

**Sizzle!** 

Her whole body turned red, and her muscles swelled up. The four horns on Jin Ryu's forehead trembled madly. **Crackle!**

"Heeekaaahhh!!! Kiyaaaah!!! Kweeeeh!!!"

She let out a seductive cry while her eyes turned over, smashing the surrounding puppets as she moved forward.
