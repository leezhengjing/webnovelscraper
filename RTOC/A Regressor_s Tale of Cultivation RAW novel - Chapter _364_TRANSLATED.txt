### A Friend from Afar (7)

The reason Beixianghua became close to Seran was partly due to their meeting through Songjin and partly due to the amusing incident involving the engagement between Shiho and Seran. However, one of the reasons she started talking to Seran was because her childhood name was also Lan (è˜­), just like Seran.

She remembered her childhood. Even now, when she closed her eyes, she could almost smell the faint magnolia scent tickling her nose.

"Lan-ah."

A woman's voice lovingly called her childhood name.

"No, it's time to stop using your childhood name, Xianghua?"

Beixianghua clung to the frail woman lying on the bed.

"No! Just call me Lan. Xianghua sounds strange."

"Hehe, it's okay. It's a pretty name."

"I don't think so."

As Beixianghua clung to the frail woman, a stern-faced middle-aged man brought a bowl of medicinal soup.

"I've brought the medicine, Yeon-ah."

"Thank you."

It was Beixianghua's father, Beizhonghu. With a stern yet somewhat sorrowful face, he fed the medicine to the frail woman, Yeon, who was Beixianghua's mother. After drinking the medicine, Yeon coughed dryly. Her eyes grew more lifeless by the day.

"Xianghua, can you live well without your mother?"

Beixianghua shook her head.

"Mom, where are you going?"

She buried her head in Yeon's chest, sobbing.

"No! Don't go! I've been having strange dreams lately. Last night, a rainbow-colored bird crushed me! I'm scared to sleep alone!"

"...My dear Xianghua. Now that you've outgrown your childhood name, you should learn to sleep alone. If you're really scared, sleep with your father."

Despite this, Beixianghua clung to Yeon, sobbing. Though she was young, she had a vague understanding. She couldn't fully grasp the concept of death, but she had a strong premonition that she would never see her mother, Yeon, again.

Seeing Beixianghua clinging to her, Yeon sighed briefly and handed her a jade-colored norigae (a traditional Korean ornament).

"Stop crying, Xianghua. I have a gift for you. Take this."

"What is it?"

"It's a promise I made with a friend when I was young."

Yeon gently patted Beixianghua's head. Beixianghua listened to the story behind the norigae.

"...So, when you meet that friend's child later, ask if they are doing well."

"Yes! And I'll keep the promise too! If it's a girl, I'll become sworn sisters, and if it's a boy, I'll marry him!"

"You don't have to do that unless you really want to. Just ask how they are doing."

"No, I'll definitely keep the promise! Absolutely!"

Beixianghua held Yeon's hand and made a firm promise. Yeon patted Beixianghua's head. She fell asleep, holding her mother's jade-colored norigae, with the scent of magnolias lingering in her hand.

* * *

"...Mom..."

Beixianghua woke up from a dream about her mother, Yeon. A strange floral scent wafted from somewhere, and delicate fingers were caressing her cheek.

"...Mom...?"

She grabbed the hand caressing her cheek and opened her blurry eyes wide. She was startled.

"Ah!"

The person caressing her cheek was not her long-deceased mother, Yeon. It was Kimyeon, dressed in a pale pink palace gown.

Beixianghua sat up on the bed with a wary expression. She quickly assessed her surroundings.

'This isn't a torture chamber or a prison. It's a clean bed... There's no binding spell or restriction. I'm not a prisoner... I'm being treated as a guest? My artifacts... They're all gone.'

Despite these facts, Beixianghua didn't completely relax but slightly lowered her guard and asked Kimyeon.

"...What happened? I clearly gave the order to self-destruct the Ilhyangham..."

Kimyeon scoffed.

"Canceling the self-destruct order of that toy ship was no big deal."

Beixianghua almost lost her temper at the dismissive remark about her creation but managed to hold back and touched her cheek.

"By the way, why were you caressing my face so tenderly?"

"I was pulling out the consciousness threads from your head. Your head is small, so it was easy to pull out. Well, with such a small head, no wonder your artifacts are like that."

Beixianghua's forehead veins bulged at the second dismissive remark about her creation.

"...Good for you, having a big head."

Kimyeon's forehead veins also bulged.

"Yeah, I'm a bit taller than you, shorty."

"Your name is Kimyeon, right? Could you please change your name? It overlaps with someone I respect, and it feels like an insult to them."

"Oh my, why bring someone else into this? I can call my master by name too, even if I don't like it."

"Ha, what kind of great person did you learn from to act like this?"

"You wouldn't know even if I told you, being from the Goryeok world."

"Why, are you embarrassed to say?"

"Hmph, you really wouldn't know. Well, there's a strange title called Gwaegun, but the puppet technique is..."

"..."

At that moment, Beixianghua's mouth dropped open. Kimyeon noticed her strange reaction and looked puzzled.

Beixianghua, with a trembling voice, asked.

"...Is your master... Gwaegun Joyeon?"

"...Yes."

"...The hunchback who rides the Gimyoseongchae?"

"How do you know that? Aren't you from the Goryeok world?"

Beixianghua didn't answer Kimyeon's question and stared blankly. After a while, she lowered her head, her spirit dampened.

"...How could such an unlucky person be the disciple of that great person...?"

Kimyeon felt annoyed but smirked as Beixianghua couldn't meet her eyes.

"You were captured by that unlucky person, weren't you?"

"...Ugh, I wasn't defeated by you."

"Excuses. By the way, how old are you to keep calling me 'you'?"

Kimyeon asked Beixianghua's age, and she hesitated before answering.

"...271."

"You're younger than me."

When Kimyeon and her group fell into Deungsunhyang, Kimyeon was 26, and Beixianghua was 18. Although the age difference became insignificant after becoming cultivators, Kimyeon crossed her arms and said to assert dominance.

"Call me 'sister.'"

Beixianghua hesitated, but the thought of Kimyeon being Gwaegun's disciple crossed her mind.

"Sis..."

"What?"

"Sis..."

"Say it louder."

"You harelip!"

In the end, Beixianghua couldn't accept Kimyeon, who had dismissed her creation, and her true feelings burst out. Kimyeon's forehead veins bulged as she grabbed Beixianghua's shoulder. After glaring at Beixianghua for a moment, Kimyeon sighed and stood up.

"...Enough. What am I doing with a kid?"

"Hmph, you look more like a kid."

"Yeah, you look aged. Thanks for the compliment."

Kimyeon looked down at Beixianghua.

"...Well, I almost forgot while arguing with you... You're Seran's dragon, Shiho's fox, and... Kimyeonghun's companion, right?"

Beixianghua, who had been fuming, calmed down and nodded. She had momentarily forgotten due to the good treatment, but technically, she was captured while fighting Kimyeon.

'What's going on? Judging by how she speaks kindly of Seran, Shiho, and Kimyeonghun, she must have known them for a long time.'

Kimyeon explained the situation to Beixianghua.

"Eunhyeon oppa... I mean, our leader, Mugukgwiwang, met Seran and Shiho when he was in the lower world."

"...Then what about Kimyeonghun?"

"He was originally part of our company... Um... How should I explain? Well, he was originally our colleague."

"...!"

Beixianghua's eyes widened in surprise.

'Kimyeonghun was from the suspicious cult of these monsters? No wonder he had many titles with 'Shinma' in them!'

She looked at Kimyeon with tense eyes and asked.

"...What will you do with me?"

"Since you're a companion of our companion, we won't treat you as an enemy. But you did lead a fleet that caused damage to our sect. So, we'll decide after you meet our leader."

"Leader..."

Beixianghua swallowed hard at the word 'leader.' She had a rough idea of who it was. The one who held nearly two-thirds of the Beixiang fleet's power, the one who practically passed on the title of 'Conqueror King' to her, and the one who gave her fleet the reason to be called the 'Invincible Fleet.' The one who fought Kimyeonghun to a standstill and even made him send a distress signal in the end! The monster-like figure who moved the entire battlefield in ten seconds and pierced through the sea barrier that Beixianghua's fleet prided itself on.

'It must be him.'

She broke into a cold sweat.

"...What kind of person is he?"

At that, Kimyeon's face turned red.

"He's... amazing."

Seeing Kimyeon's reaction, Beixianghua realized one thing.

'This woman is in love with the leader.'

And she formed a preconception about the leader.

'If this unlucky person likes him, he must be a twisted and bizarre person. No, it's a cult of ghosts, so he might not even be human!'

After chatting about Seoeunhyun for a while, Kimyeon noticed Beixianghua's strange thoughts and frowned.

"...You seem to be thinking something impure. Anyway, get up and change your clothes. You need to learn the etiquette and language used in the Muguk sect. Get up!"

"What? Wait! What are you doing! Kyaa!"

Kimyeon, with an annoyed face, helped Beixianghua change clothes and used the Gimyoseongshimjeon to instill the Muguk sect's language and etiquette.

* * *

"Oh no! I didn't think Master would be worried. I feel sorry for him."

As soon as Kimyeonghun woke up, Seran sighed after hearing the reason they came here. Kimyeonghun, who had just woken up, explained the situation to Seran with a somewhat enlightened face and welcomed us. He caught up with old colleagues like Jeonmyeonghun, Ohhyeonseok, and me, and expressed regret upon hearing about Kangminhee and Ohhyeseo.

"Hahaha! But brother! Why do you look so weak? You need a bomb drink!"

Ohhyeonseok, who had always been close to Kimyeonghun, approached him with a hearty laugh. However, Kimyeonghun, despite being approached by his closest brother, Ohhyeonseok, looked somewhat empty and smiled weakly.

'...It's not because of me, right?'

I wondered if I had destroyed his beloved artifacts too harshly, but since Kimyeonghun didn't say anything, I kept my mouth shut.

And so, while Seran, Shiho, Kimyeonghun, Ohhyeonseok, Jeonmyeonghun, and I were laughing and enjoying ourselves in the VIP room, I sensed two people approaching the room.

Thump, thumpâ€”

Was it because Kimyeonghun and his colleagues were drinking the Muguk sect's precious liquor? Or was it because I couldn't shake off the shadows of the past? My heart was pounding for no reason.

And soon after, the door to the VIP room opened. Two familiar faces appeared.

Kimyeon. And... Beixianghua.

Beixianghua, whom I hadn't seen in a long time, was wearing clothes similar to those she wore on the day we ascended together.

* * *

Kimyeon thought while helping Beixianghua change clothes.

'As plain as possible!'

She remembered Seoeunhyun's reaction when he first saw Beixianghua. So, Kimyeon dressed Beixianghua in the plain white clothes worn by the Muguk sect's ghost maidens.

'If her appearance doesn't stand out, Eunhyeon oppa won't pay much attention.'

After instilling some information into Beixianghua using the Gimyoseongshimjeon, Kimyeon took her to Seoeunhyun.

Soon after, Kimyeon and Beixianghua arrived at the place where Seoeunhyun, the Muguk sect's leaders, and the Conqueror fleet's leaders were gathered. Beixianghua walked nervously, practically dragged by Kimyeon.

Finally, they arrived at the VIP room and met Seoeunhyun's eyes amidst the tension.

"...Oh."

Her eyes widened. Beixianghua opened and closed her mouth several times before finally speaking, placing her hand on her chest, which was unknowingly fluttering.

"...It was you."

The person she had been searching for throughout the entire water realm while building the Beixiang fleet. The one who brought her mother's jade-colored norigae, the promised counterpart.

And Seoeunhyun smiled faintly. His thoughts stirred, and he seemed to recall something. The first to notice the strange atmosphere between them was Kimyeon. She stared blankly at the back of Beixianghua's head. She had secretly implanted a strand of her soul into Beixianghua using the Gimyoseongshimjeon, so she could control her like a puppet if needed.

Beixianghua, staring blankly at Seoeunhyun, took out the jade-colored norigae from her bosom.

"...You gave this to me last time, didn't you?"

Seoeunhyun looked at the jade-colored norigae. Beixianghua, with a trembling voice, struggled to find the right words. For some reason, she couldn't think of what to say. But she managed to recall Yeon's words.

"Just ask how they are doing."

Beixianghua asked Seoeunhyun.

"This norigae... So, you... You weren't the original owner, but you received it... right?"

Seoeunhyun, with a blank expression, nodded. Beixianghua asked him.

"Was the person who gave you the norigae... well?"

It seemed like an out-of-the-blue question, but it was important to Beixianghua. She had sworn not to leave the Cheonseongseong until she asked this question to the person who brought the norigae. It was Yeon's last wish.

Seoeunhyun closed his eyes for a moment.

* * *

"Was she well..."

The one who gave me that norigae was the Beixianghua of the 10th cycle. I remembered the moment we ascended together for the last time. I recalled her pure soul rising to the sky after kissing me. Yes, she left for the afterlife without any grudges. So, she must have been well.

I nodded and met Beixianghua's eyes, answering her.

"...The one who gave me the norigae left for the sky without any grudges."

"I see... That's a relief."

It seemed like her question and my answer were different, but I thought of the Beixianghua from the 10th cycle and made up my mind.

"So, you don't need to worry, Miss."

The current her and the previous her are different people. Let's be clear. We can build a good relationship as colleagues from now on. But she is not the one I shared love with.

"Please have a seat, Miss. The Muguk sect and your Conqueror fleet can become good allies."

Beixianghua, with a slightly dazed expression, sat down. It seemed like she was expecting something else from me, but for now, she was not the person I had given my heart to.

* * *

Beixianghua, seeing that Seran and Shiho were safe, cleared up her misunderstandings about the Muguk sect. However, she still had a dazed expression.

'Ah... That was the right thing to hear.'

She had followed her mother's last wish to ask about the well-being and, if possible, to form a sisterhood or marriage. She didn't covet marriage since Kimyeon seemed to be by the leader's side. But for some reason, Beixianghua felt a part of her heart being torn away.

'It was like that from the beginning.'

It was the same when he first brought the norigae. She had felt a strange sensation. She smiled bitterly and excused herself from the lively VIP room. Her chest felt strange. She found a reasonable explanation for why she felt that way.

'...What should I live for now?'

One of her life's purposes was to follow her mother's last wish. She had received the norigae and asked about the well-being. Having achieved all her goals, she felt empty. Or maybe it was because she could no longer reminisce about her mother after fulfilling her purpose. The sadness of not being able to remember her mother anymore. And the emotions that surged when she saw that man. Various emotions welled up.

And Kimyeon appeared beside her. Beixianghua hid her gloomy expression and asked.

"What is it?"

"...I'm here to monitor you."

"Ha. That's funny and childish."

But Kimyeon didn't pick a fight and said.

"If you want to cry, just cry."

"What?"

"As your senior in life and a disciple of Gwaegun, I'll accept it. Sometimes you just feel like crying."

"What are you talking about..."

But Beixianghua realized she was already crying. Kimyeon, who had been glaring at her earlier, approached and patted her back. Eventually, Beixianghua burst into tears in Kimyeon's arms. She didn't know why. Was it because she had fulfilled her life's goal of following her mother's last wish? Or was it because of Seoeunhyun, who made her heart flutter? Or was it because of Kimyeon, who had the same name as her mother? Or maybe it was because Kimyeon had a strange floral scent, like the magnolia scent her mother had.

"..."

Kimyeon extended her consciousness to block anyone from monitoring them and hugged Beixianghua, who had suddenly burst into tears. Kimyeon still disliked Beixianghua. And Beixianghua, who was crying in her arms, also disliked Kimyeon. But Kimyeon accepted Beixianghua's sudden emotions for one reason. Seoeunhyun had done the same for her when she was struggling.

Kimyeon read Beixianghua's emotions through the Gimyoseongshimjeon. Emotions were multicolored, so she couldn't read them all, but she saw the worry and sadness for her parents in Beixianghua's heart and overlapped her past self with Beixianghua.

After a while, Beixianghua wiped her tears and said.

"...Thank you, sister."
