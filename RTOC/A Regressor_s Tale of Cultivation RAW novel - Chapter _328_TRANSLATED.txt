Hong Beom was the first to notice my abnormality. Seeing my complexion, he hurriedly approached and asked, "Master, is something wrong?"

"...I'm fine. But, inside the corpse..."

Soon, the corpse's body would collapse, and we would enter the Guanghan Realm.

Crack—

The sky collapsed. Soon, the dimensional veil of the Guanghan Realm appeared before our eyes.

'Three strands of force...'

Just like last time, I felt three strands of force grasping at my hand. One led to the Biseon Path, another to the Black Ghost Bone Valley, and the last one...

'Ah, I see.'

I finally understood the identity of the last strand of force.

"Is it Goryeok?"

Gangnyeong Lord, Mingbu's second-in-command, Goryeok Jin-gun Haenyeong! I felt the same sensation I had when I read Haenyeong's will left for Jeongryong and from the tears in the Blue Scale Armor. It was clear.

'This is the force leading to the Goryeok Realm.'

I pondered for a moment.

'Should I go to the Goryeok Realm?'

At that moment, the force from the Goryeok Realm suddenly intensified.

'Damn it!'

The force, as if determined to pull me in, entangled me!

"Seo Eun-hyeon, what's happening?"

"Master!"

Jeon Myeong-hun and Hong Beom looked at me in shock.

"It seems another intermediate realm is trying to pull me in."

Although the Guanghan Realm is somewhat close to the Water Realm due to the Ascension Gate, one could still ascend to the Goryeok Realm, Mingui Realm, Jinma, or the Purple Gold Realm if qualified. Given that I was in the process of ascending from the Water Realm, I could easily reach the Goryeok Realm without much time.

'What should I do? Should I go to another intermediate realm?'

It could be a good choice. After all, Kim Yeong-hun, Buk Hyang-hwa, and Seo Ran are in the Goryeok Realm. Meeting them wouldn't be a bad idea.

However, I frowned.

'No, not now.'

Being swept away by this force right now would be absurd. There were many things to do in the Guanghan Realm, and I needed to find a way to save Kang Min-hee.

'Let's go to the Guanghan Realm first.'

I made my decision and gathered my strength.

Vrrrr—

Currently, my martial arts level was at the First Step of the Royal Court. In terms of cultivation, I was at the Celestial, Earthly, and Four Pillars. Although I possessed the Pillar of Wealth, it was just an addition, and to utilize it properly, I needed to reach the Four Pillars stage. Just as Seo Hyul had obtained the Pillar through the Ritual of the Pillar while in the lower realm, but his actual power was only at the Celestial level, I was in a similar state. However, as confirmed during my regression, if one reached the Four Pillars stage, they could manipulate the force with just their soul.

'My cultivation is at the Celestial level, but my soul is at the Four Pillars stage...'

Rumble—

I manipulated the force, breaking free from the Goryeok Realm's pull. Approaching Jeon Myeong-hun and Hong Beom, I reached out towards the dimensional veil of the Guanghan Realm.

Boom!

With an explosion of light, we entered the Guanghan Realm.

* * *

How many hours had passed since Seo Eun-hyeon entered the Guanghan Realm?

Rumble—

Outside the dimensional veil of the Guanghan Realm, a massive swarm of dark red mist wriggled, approaching the Guanghan Realm.

Boom—

The dark red entity tried to approach the Guanghan Realm but was scorched by a massive celestial tribulation. It lingered around for a while before retreating.

* * *

Swoosh!

Familiar spiritual energy surrounded me. From afar, someone who appeared to be a Four Pillars inspector was flying towards us. I spoke to Jeon Myeong-hun.

"Jeon Myeong-hun, you know about the rituals of the Golden Thunder Sect, right?"

"Yeah. What do you need?"

After the fall of the Golden Thunder Sect in the Guanghan Realm, Jeon Myeong-hun had paradoxically studied its remnants like a madman. Among them were rituals to delay celestial tribulations.

"Stop the celestial tribulation for a moment. I have something to do."

"Hmm?"

Without waiting for a response, I sat down and focused my consciousness.

Rumble, rumble!

Dark clouds began to gather in the sky. Just as Chang Ho-ja, Heo Gwak, Geum Byeok-ho, and Seo Hyul had reached the Four Pillars stage upon ascending to the Guanghan Realm, I did the same. Using the force generated from my soul, I gathered a massive amount of celestial and earthly energy. Simultaneously, I reached the Four Pillars stage with the energy stored in the Colorless Glass Sword.

Rumble!

"Damn it! At least give a warning!"

Despite his curses, Jeon Myeong-hun quickly planted the flags of the Seven Thunder Formation and activated the formation. Crack, crack, boom! Interacting with the formation's energy, Jeon Myeong-hun sacrificed three of his fingers, imbued with the Celestial Golden Thunder Body, to temporarily delay the celestial tribulation. The celestial energy shifted, and the tribulation that should have struck during my ascension was postponed for three days. For a moment, it felt as if the dragon veins of the Heaven and Earth Middle Realm were merging with me.

'I understand why Hyeon-won recuperates in the Heaven and Earth Middle Realm.'

Harmony! The yin and yang energies were perfectly balanced, harmonizing with each other. The Tai Chi Thunder God could twist and distort the yin and yang within an opponent's body, but the dragon veins of the Heaven and Earth Middle Realm seemed to gradually restore the distorted yin and yang.

Boom!

A tremendous explosion erupted from my body, and a brilliant light burst forth. I had ascended to the Four Pillars stage in an instant.

'It's slightly lacking.'

To achieve the Three Tai Chi, I needed to use the power of the Ghost King given to me by Seo Rip to elevate the Celestial Cultivation Technique to the Four Pillars stage. However, achieving the Four Pillars stage with the Celestial Cultivation Technique required a ritual, which was not feasible at the moment.

As I was assessing my power, Hyeon-won appeared, splitting the space.

"You..."

"Ah. Greetings, Lord of Bongrae Palace. It's been a while."

I met Hyeon-won's gaze and spoke. He glared at me with his inspection eyes.

"Your manners are lacking."

"Apologies for that. But I don't have good feelings towards you, so I hope you understand."

"..."

He glared at me. Despite his dignified and handsome appearance with his black headband and topknot, his hair was disheveled, and he looked quite haggard with dark circles under his eyes. As Yeon-wi had said, he must have been quite a handsome man in his youth, but now he was just a worn-out old man.

"And one more thing. Jeon Myeong-hun, the highest elder of the Golden Thunder Sect, has canceled our bounty, so there's no need to capture us."

"Ah, that's right. I will no longer pursue Seo Eun-hyeon. But Seo Eun-hyeon, how dare you speak to the Lord like that?"

Jeon Myeong-hun spoke politely, but he looked at me disapprovingly for my attitude. Hyeon-won glanced at us for a moment, then nodded and turned around. I immediately drew the Colorless Glass Sword, and Hyeon-won, as if expecting it, turned back and struck at me.

Flash!

A palm-shaped energy wave imbued with the power of the Five Elements flew towards me. I infused the Colorless Glass Sword with the Total Celestial Sword and deflected Hyeon-won's strike into the sky.

Boom!

The sky trembled, and the defensive barrier surrounding the entire Heaven and Earth Star shook and became visible. Jeon Myeong-hun was bewildered by the sudden situation, and I smirked at Hyeon-won.

"Why the sudden rampage?"

Hyeon-won seemed to be observing me. He glared at me and snapped his fingers.

Snap!

Vroom!

The space twisted, and we were suddenly outside the Heaven and Earth Star, thanks to Hyeon-won's teleportation technique.

"To be honest, I don't like you guys. Despite my support for the Golden Thunder Sect, you still managed to destroy it again..."

"What!?"

Jeon Myeong-hun's eyes widened in anger at those words. However, Hyeon-won ignored him and continued to glare at me.

"But still, you are valuable members of the human race, so I can't harm you recklessly. Since I've lost my investment in the Golden Thunder Sect, you must compensate for my loss by enduring my strike. If you can withstand my strike, I will forgive you and forget about my investment."

"..."

"What nonsense is that!? Do you even know what investment means!?"

Jeon Myeong-hun shouted angrily, emitting electric sparks, while I chuckled at Hyeon-won's words.

"Ha, haha... Hahaha...!"

As I burst into laughter, Jeon Myeong-hun and Hyeon-won looked at me.

"Ah... This is hilarious."

What? If I endure his strike, he'll forgive me? Let me go?

'This guy... When I seemed weak, he tried to kill me outright, but now that I seem a bit formidable, he changes his tune?'

Knowing Hyeon-won well, his change in attitude due to my regression was infuriating.

Thud, thud...

I took out the Primordial Oil from my pocket and placed it beside me. Then, I pushed the Primordial Oil towards Jeon Myeong-hun and said,

"Fine. Come at me, Hyeon-won Lord."

Hyeon-won's eyes twitched, and he began to gather force in his hands.

"Alright. If that's what you want..."

It seemed as if the yin and yang of heaven and earth were concentrating on Hyeon-won.

'Let's see...'

Rumble—

As I activated the Starry Giant Technique, I transformed into a giant of starlight. My body grew larger, and immense strength filled my entire being. Hyeon-won floated into the air to match my eye level, preparing the Taesan Yeolje Gong. Meanwhile, I drew upon the power of the Ghost King given to me by Seo Rip. Although it wasn't a complete Celestial Four Pillars stage, by overlaying General Seo's circuit onto my body, I could temporarily exert the power of the Celestial Four Pillars stage.

Rumble—

Faces began to sprout from my shoulders. Screeching— Screaming— Wailing— As ghostly wails echoed, 18 faces emerged on my shoulders.

"What the hell is that!?"

"A monster from the Void has invaded!!!"

"The Lord of Heaven and Earth Star is going to slay the monster!"

"Lord! Don't lose!"

As the giant of starlight with 19 heads appeared, the Four Pillars and Celestial cultivators in the Heaven and Earth Star screamed in terror.

Vrrrr—

Although it was a forced amplification using the Ghost King's circuit, it allowed me to summon the Three Tai Chi for a brief moment.

Rumble—

Although the form was slightly unstable, a massive symbol of the Three Tai Chi appeared as a halo behind the 19 heads. Seeing this grotesque form, Jeon Myeong-hun looked slightly uneasy.

Swoosh!

Celestial and earthly energy surrounded me. At the same time, Hyeon-won, who had gathered the yin and yang energy in his hands, glared at me with glowing eyes.

Rumble!

An immense power emanated from Hyeon-won's hands. However, I smirked at him.

Crackle—

Salt sprouted from my hands. I channeled all the power of the Three Tai Chi into the force in my hands.

'I've always wanted to try this.'

I laughed inwardly as I concentrated the power of the Yin Soul Ghost Curse and the White Orchid Sacred Gate into my hands. Then, I shouted the same words as Hyeon-won.

Hyeon-won's eyes showed confusion and astonishment, as if asking, 'What kind of sorcery is this!?'

I smirked and extended my hands towards Hyeon-won. Around him, the jade of the Five Elements also appeared. Gritting his teeth, Hyeon-won extended his hand towards me.

Flash!

The world turned white.

* * *

In a space filled only with light, two beings were clashing.

A giant of starlight with 19 heads and a halo behind them. And a dignified middle-aged man with a topknot, surrounded by the energy of yin and yang.

At some point, as their powers reached their peak and the boundaries of objects became blurred, they saw [something] in each other.

The giant of starlight with 19 heads saw a 'name' in the direction of Hyeon-won. It was the name 'Cheonra.'

Crack!

From the body of the giant of starlight with 19 heads, numerous strange rocks, trees, and soil sprouted, transforming the giant into a mountain.

Conversely, the dignified middle-aged man saw a 'shape' in the direction of the giant. It was a [reverse cone].

Crack!

Salt pillars began to grow from the middle-aged man's body. Seeing something terrifying in each other, both beings screamed simultaneously.
