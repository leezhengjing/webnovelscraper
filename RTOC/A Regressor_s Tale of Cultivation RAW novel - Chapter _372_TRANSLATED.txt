In the sea (1) High Power Realm. Wujig Cult. In the underground of the Wujig Cult's headquarters, Wujig Hall, the high-ranking members of the cult were gathered with serious expressions.

"So, you're saying that Seo Eunhyun, who was trying to extend his consciousness to the lower realm to build the Gangnyeong Pillar, suddenly had his stomach split open and vomited blood?"

"Yes. And since then, he has been in a coma."

Crash! Clatter...

Seo Eunhyun, who was connected to the consciousness of the Biseonjin while sitting in the cult leader's chair, could not open his eyes and occasionally vomited boiling blood from his seven orifices. Jeon Myunghun looked at Hongbeom, who was with Seo Eunhyun, with a bewildered expression, and Hongbeom nodded and handed over the records of the incident.

"First, take a look at this."

After watching the past scenes through Hongbeom's magic for a while, Jeon Myunghun asked with an even more serious expression.

"What on earth is this?"

"In my opinion..."

At that moment, Yeonwi, who was watching the records shown by Hongbeom, spoke with a serious expression.

"This, this is...!"

"Ancestor, do you know something?"

"Yes, fortunately, it matches what I know."

She looked at Seo Eunhyun's condition with a darkened face and said.

"Suddenly falling into a coma and vomiting boiling blood. It is highly likely that he has been cursed by the deep-sea monsters of the High Power Realm, known as the Deep Sea Curse (沈海呪)!"

"Deep Sea Curse...?"

"Yes. Occasionally, among the deep-sea monsters of the High Power Realm, there are those that cast very bizarre curses. If one is cursed by such a deep-sea monster, they fall into a coma and exhibit strange symptoms. I once saw the master of the Angryong Palace, who was chasing me in the High Power Realm, suffer from a mild Deep Sea Curse, frequently falling into a coma and suffering from a fever."

At Yeonwi's words, Bukhyanghwa asked with a slightly puzzled expression.

"But, as far as I know, when one is cursed by the Deep Sea Curse, scales like flower petals appear on their body..."

"What nonsense! I came to the High Power Realm 40,000 years ago and have encountered all sorts of news and information. What you know is just a characteristic of a specific type of Deep Sea Curse!"

At those words, Bukhyanghwa nodded and stepped back.

'Yeonwi has lived for a very long time, so she must know more than I do.'

Yeonwi ignored Bukhyanghwa's question and spoke to Kim Younghoon with a serious face.

"Hey, Shinjok. Make a cut on Seo Eunhyun's body."

"Alright."

Buzz!

A golden light flashed, and a small cut appeared on Seo Eunhyun's cheek, causing blood to flow. Yeonwi caught a drop of the blood and floated it in the air.

Buzz!

Seo Eunhyun's blood floated in the air due to Yeonwi's psychokinesis, bubbling as if alive and emitting a hazy mist.

"Look at this. This reaction only appears in the blood of a Seonju. But this guy is a pure human, not of Seonju bloodline. This phenomenon occurring means that the power of the deep-sea monster's curse is embedded in his body, causing it to boil."

Yeonwi burst Seo Eunhyun's blood with a serious face.

Bang!

As Seo Eunhyun's blood burst in the air, it emitted a dark and gloomy aura around it.

"And this evil and bizarre aura! It is undoubtedly similar to the unpredictable nature seen in deep-sea monsters! Seo Eunhyun must have been cursed by some deep-sea monster!"

However, Hongbeom spoke with a puzzled expression.

"Um... Yeonwi, military advisor. But to me, that aura seems similar to the 'Shinja' of the true people in the Myunggui Realm..."

"What...?"

"I think the master might have encountered a true person while extending his consciousness to the lower realm, rather than being cursed by the Deep Sea Curse."

"Silence! You fool! Do you think my judgment, honed over countless years, is more accurate, or your judgment, not even 500 years old?"

At Yeonwi's words, Hongbeom tilted his head and stepped back. She clicked her tongue in displeasure and spoke.

"Anyway, the master of the Angryong Palace, who was cursed by the Deep Sea Curse, only suffered from a fever and occasionally woke up from a coma, but Seo Eunhyun's blood is boiling, and he shows no signs of waking up, so he must be cursed by a much stronger Deep Sea Curse."

"Is there a cure?"

Kim Yeon asked worriedly, and Yeonwi nodded with a proud expression.

"Of course! The Deep Sea Curse is indeed terrifying, but it can be cured. The Deep Sea Curse can be treated with Goseok."

"Goseok?"

"Yes. You can transfer the curse of the deep-sea monster into the Goseok. When the master of the Angryong Palace was cursed by the Deep Sea Curse 40,000 years ago, I heard it took about a million Goseok to cure him. Seo Eunhyun's symptoms seem six to seven times worse, so... it would take about ten million Goseok."

At those words, Bukhyanghwa, Seoran, and many others' eyes widened in shock.

"Ten million Goseok...?"

"Even a million Goseok is the ten-year budget of a single sea palace..."

Yeonwi looked at their reactions and spoke.

"Well, at least it can be cured with Goseok. We have four sea regions in our hands, so we should be able to gather a few million Goseok immediately, right?"

Seoran spoke in a flustered manner.

"Currently, we can gather about four million Goseok from the four sea regions. Goseok is highly valuable, traded at a ratio of one Goseok to a hundred Yeongseok."

"Hmm... then we need about six million more."

Yeonwi scratched her head with a serious expression, and Hongbeom sighed as he looked at Seo Eunhyun.

"...I don't think it's a curse... Master being cursed..."

"What? What did you say, Hongbeom?"

"...Nothing."

"Alright. Then let's all work hard to gather the six million Goseok we need!"

Thus, except for Hongbeom, Yeonwi and everyone else began gathering Goseok to save Seo Eunhyun.

* * *

It's hot. No, should I say it's warm? It felt like being in the amniotic fluid of a mother.

'Wait, what?'

"Gasp!"

Splash!

When I came to my senses, I was in the water.

'Water?'

As I regained consciousness, I realized I was half-submerged in a place that looked like a hot spring covered in steam.

"Where... is this?"

Just a moment ago, I was fighting Jang Ik and being chased by the true person of the Gaeryeolgi. But where is this place?

I tried to extend my consciousness to look around in confusion. However, I realized that my consciousness couldn't extend.

'What is this? Is this water blocking the expansion of my consciousness? No... this space itself is blocking it.'

I stood up cautiously from the hot spring. But as I did, I felt a sense of unease and looked down at the floor submerged up to my knees.

"What...!"

There was no floor.

Splash!

As soon as I realized there was no 'floor,' whatever I was 'standing on' disappeared, and I sank into the hot spring.

Splash, splash!

I eventually resurfaced and tried to gather my energy to cast Cheonsangje, but I suddenly felt something strange again.

'There's no energy!?'

Indeed. Strangely, this place that looked like a hot spring had no energy nearby. No, even if I tried to release the energy within my body, it wouldn't come out.

'This space itself is twisted.'

It must be some kind of formation or restriction, not an ordinary space.

Bang!

I felt the flow of steam and air around me with my skin and controlled my body to rise into the air using Hwagongdapo.

'I need to explore the surroundings.'

I rose into the air to explore. But as I did...

"What?"

Even though I rose into the 'sky,' the 'hot spring' I had just left appeared above me.

Splash!

I fell back into the hot spring I had just escaped from.

'What is this, damn it?'

I felt frustrated, realizing that the space was distorted or my sense of direction was messed up. I decided to open my eyes underwater and swim down.

How long did I swim down, holding my breath?

Splash!

"..."

I resurfaced in the same hot spring as before.

'Stay calm.'

I was bewildered by this bizarre situation but took a deep breath to stay calm.

'If there's no energy, what moves this space? If neither energy nor consciousness can move, then...'

I thought for a moment and remembered that I had used Hwagongdapo to rise into the air.

"Gravity."

Yes. Even if energy and consciousness couldn't be used, gravity still existed in this space. Even if the space was twisted, gravity still 'existed.'

'If gravity exists, fate also exists.'

I closed my eyes and recalled. The Cheongcheon Sword transcends realms. If only gravity exists, fate must also exist. And the fact that 'I exist here' means that 'my sword also exists.'

The Cheongcheon Sword is me. That means...

Crackle!

Energy surged from my entire body, slicing through the hot spring water around me.

Swoosh!

Every drop of water around me burst into steam. In an instant, all the water around me turned into steam.

Buzz―

'So, this is...'

I felt the Cheongcheon Sword, which had completely transformed into gravity, and my eyes sparkled. Thanks to the characteristics of this space, the Cheongcheon Sword had risen to the level of life (命)!

Crack!

Using the Cheongcheon Sword, I sliced through the gravity that governed this space!

Swoosh!

I swung my sword towards the air. And in the next moment, the hot spring world that surrounded me was enveloped in mist, and I found myself in a different place.

'Where is this...?'

Swoosh!

Hot water. Steam covering the surroundings. Another hot spring. However...

Rumble!

I heard massive [voices] that seemed to shake the heavens and earth from all directions.

Gasp!

Cough!

Hearing those voices, I felt my seven orifices burst with blood, and my insides churned. Fortunately...

Buzz!

'I can use energy!'

In this new hot spring, I could use energy and consciousness, and I quickly gathered energy to heal my body. Unlike the previous hot spring, this one had visible rocks and reefs, and there was a definite 'floor,' so I could climb onto those.

I climbed onto a nearby rock and looked around.

Rumble!

'What is that!'

But as I tried to extend my consciousness, I quickly retracted it and lowered my gaze. Beyond the mist of the hot spring, shadows of giant beings flickered.

Recalling how my insides churned just from hearing their voices, I guessed their identities. Swallowing my saliva, I respectfully bowed towards the shadows beyond the mist.

"...A mere human cultivator, Seo Mo, greets the venerable ones."

As I greeted them, I heard chuckling from beyond the mist.

Cough!

Splash!

It felt like the entire space was shaking. Just their laughter alone felt like a full-force attack from a combined technique.

"...Thank you for your consideration."

'Was that a bit too loud?'

I felt a bit absurd but continued to bow my head. At that moment...

Flinch!

One of the venerable ones licked their lips and asked me in a subtle voice from beyond the mist. I looked up at them with tense eyes.

Malice. There was definitely a feeling of 'deliciousness,' but that venerable one seemed to harbor a grudge against humans, sending malice towards me.

But how should I answer here? As I remained silent, the shadow beyond the mist clicked their tongue in annoyance.

Crunch, crunch!

And my leg started to be torn off.

"...!!!"

It was as if a cosmic force was tearing my leg apart like a bug! But I gritted my teeth and covered my leg with the Cheongcheon Sword, switching realms to escape the force's influence.

The shadow seemed intrigued but displeased and spoke.

In the next moment.

Rumble!

My entire body started to be crushed. The venerable one's force concentrated on me.

'What, what is this...!'

It was a force that could compress an entire continent into the size of a fist. Realizing I had less than a second before I was turned into a paste, I gritted my teeth and endured.

Buzz!

A halo of the Three Taeguk appeared behind my head, pushing back the venerable one's force. But the venerable one only seemed amused and increased the force on me.

'I'm going to die...'

And just when I thought I couldn't hold on any longer.

Swoosh!

The nearby hot spring water split, and something green floated into the air. It was Jang Ik, the Hamcheon Venerable. He wiped the water off his head and looked at me.

"Huh, you've already regained consciousness? Impressive. But... what are you doing?"

He looked at the voice playing with me and burned with green light. The voice flinched and laughed.

At Jang Ik's words, the voice flinched and laughed.

Jang Ik climbed onto a nearby reef with a stern face and spoke.

"Let go immediately. He's my disciple."

"...You knew, so why didn't you let go?"

But even though Jang Ik called me his disciple, the venerable one across the way just laughed.

"I've already tested him. And it seems he escaped from the bubble on his own, so that should be enough. Let go."

In the next moment, Jang Ik disappeared from his spot. The force that was crushing me vanished, and a terrible scream came from beyond the mist.

Flash!

A green light flashed where the shadow was. The venerable one who had been crushing me screamed in pain and struggled.

The entire space trembled and shook. After a while, the voice subsided, and Jang Ik reappeared next to me. The venerable ones who had been chatting around us fell silent.

"Now, they won't cause you any trouble next time, so don't worry. That venerable one from the True Demon Realm had a grudge against humans before becoming a venerable one, so he acts like that whenever he sees a human."

"..."

"Well... it's not a good place to talk here, so let's move."

Buzz!

Jang Ik waved his hand towards the air, slicing through it, and we instantly moved to another place. It was a place filled with endless darkness.

Crackle, crack!

In the darkness, Jang Ik lit a fire.

"You must have many questions. Take your time and ask."

"...First, where are we?"

"We are on the outskirts of the Thunder Saint Sea (雷聖海). The outskirts of the Thunder Saint Sea are intertwined with countless barriers and dimensions created by the Golden God, so countless dimensions overlap."

"The Thunder Saint Sea..."

It seemed I had reached my intended destination.

"...Do you know where Hamjin is?"

"That kid who came with your descent body? I dropped him off on a star near the Thunder Saint Sea where he could survive. If he's at the level of a Qi Condensation human, he won't die easily."

"...Thank you."

"You're an interesting one. Is he important to you?"

"Is there any bond I've formed that isn't important?"

"A wise answer."

Jang Ik laughed heartily and sliced through the air. A brilliant golden light poured out from beyond the air, and Jang Ik reached into it and took something out.

'An apple?'

It was a golden apple shining with golden light. He threw the golden apple into the fire to cook it and spoke.

"Do you have any other questions?"

"Will you take me as your disciple?"

"You already agreed, didn't you?"

"What?"

Confused, I recalled that I had indeed accepted his offer while fleeing from the Gaeryeolgi's hand with him.

"You're my 23rd disciple. Congratulations. Hahaha!"

"...That was... I said that when I wasn't in my right mind..."

"Are you saying you accepted when you were mentally weak? But the emotion you expressed then was clearly a strong desire."

"..."

"Anyway, I've already taken you as my disciple, so you are my disciple. Understand that."

He waved his hand as if he wouldn't accept any objections. But I shook my head and spoke.

"There is a more outstanding genius than me. You should take him as your disciple instead."

"Then I'll take him as my disciple too and take you as well. What are you talking about? Introduce him to me later."

"...Alright."

It was surprisingly simple. 'Anyway, I've made a connection to introduce Kim Younghoon to Jang Ik... that's good.'

"Do you have any other questions?"

"...Why are you asking me so many questions?"

"To empty you."

"What?"

"I'm trying to clear your mind as much as possible by answering your questions. It will make it easier to train you."

"Hmm..."

I had a feeling that Jang Ik's training would be extremely tough and grueling. But I couldn't refuse.

'Since it's come to this, I'll ask everything I can.'

I asked the most curious question first.

"I heard that the venerable ones came to the Thunder Saint Sea to retrieve very important things from the Middle Realm. What are those important things?"

"Names."

"Names...?"

"Yes. Each Middle Realm has a 'true name' besides Guanghan, True Demon, High Power, Purple Gold, Myunggui, and Blood Yin. And the Golden God stole the jade plaques containing the power of those true names and embedded them in his treasure. So, we're going to retrieve them."

"What happens if you find those names...?"

"If we find the names, the dimensional barrier of the Middle Realm will become much thicker, it will have ritual significance, and the gravity will improve in some way. I don't know the details... but one thing is important."

I was startled by Jang Ik's next words.

"If we retrieve the jade plaques with the true names of the Middle Realm, the chances of the living beings in the Middle Realm avoiding the apocalypse will increase exponentially!"

"...!"

The apocalypse! It was a word I had heard occasionally before. I swallowed my saliva and cautiously asked.

"What is this apocalypse...?"

"The name says it all. The world will be destroyed. This celestial realm, including our star system, the six Middle Realms, and the sub-sea realms connected to the Middle Realms. All worlds will be annihilated."

"Then..."

"The time is about 10,000 years from now."

"...What?"

I stared blankly at Jang Ik, losing my mind. He repeated it as if it were nothing new.

"In 10,000 years, the world will end
