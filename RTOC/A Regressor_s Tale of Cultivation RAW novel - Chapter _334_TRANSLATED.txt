The Madness of the Old Monster (2)

"Hoo…."

I sighed after somehow receiving the title of Taesu.

'With the disappearance of Taeyeoljeon, the difficulty has increased significantly.'

Moreover, if the title of Taesu is so guarded by the General Alliance, it might as well be nonexistent. Anyway, if I had stayed still, the Taesu of the Fusion Technique, who had received hints from Hyeonwon, would have continued to pursue me. But by obtaining the qualification of Taesu, that wouldn't happen, so I decided to be satisfied with that for now.

I used the Transmission Talisman to contact Hongbeom.

"Hongbeom, come to Cheonin Island with Jeon Myeonghun."

I waited for Hongbeom while recovering my spiritual power under the basin created by Junje. Now that I had regained the qualification of Taesu, the next task was simple.

'First, rescue Kim Yeon, then kidnap Kang Minhee or do something to prevent her from rampaging as the Demon Mother of the Ghost Path.'

And there was something I needed to ask Yeonwi once I called her. At that moment, lightning flashed.

Boom!

As if the red thunder was writhing, Jeon Myeonghun landed in front of me with his arms crossed.

"Looks like you've done something incredible again."

He clicked his tongue as he looked around.

"I'm a busy man, you know. By the way…."

I looked at Jeon Myeonghun's feet. He had six shadows.

"It seems you've almost mastered the Six Extreme Yin Thunder God."

"Yes. I've mastered the Thunder God Technique part, but the curse and ghost path parts are difficult, so I haven't fully mastered them."

The Six Extreme Yin Thunder God was a demonic technique that combined curse techniques, ghost path techniques, and thunder path techniques. It involved injecting ghost energy into one's original spirit through six symbols of curses—sudden death, misfortune, disease, poverty, evil, and weakness—and interpreting the ghost energy and one's internal life force as yin and yang to form Yin Thunder. If one had already mastered the Thunder Path Technique, they only needed to convert the internal thunder energy into Yin Thunder by dyeing it with the symbols of curses.

Originally, Yin Thunder was formed through curses and ghost energy, but Jeon Myeonghun was training in the Six Extreme Yin Thunder God in a unique way by somehow generating Yin Thunder first and then forming curses and ghost energy based on that Yin Thunder.

'How does he even do that….'

I was slightly amazed at the absurdity of the Heavenly Golden Thunder Body and began to speak.

"First, I want to explain our future plans."

"What is it?"

"Basically, our goal is to raise our cultivation levels, but in the process, let's gather our comrades like Kim Yeon, Kang Minhee, and Oh Hyeon-seok."

"What about Deputy Oh?"

"Oh Hye-seo? Hmm… I have some information. Oh Hye-seo is living well right now. No need to worry."

"Well, if you say so."

I explained to Jeon Myeonghun what we needed to do.

"I'll go rescue Kim Yeon first. You go rescue Hyeon-seok hyung… I mean, the Deputy Director. He's in the True Demon Realm, and the Taesu of the True Demon Realm are currently pushing the human race, so he's probably retreating. Help him retreat as quickly as possible."

"How quickly?"

"There's a high probability that the Black Dragon King Hyeon-eum will descend into the True Demon Realm. Before he enters the True Demon Realm, as quickly as possible. Of course, even if the Black Dragon King comes, I plan to stop him… but just in case."

If the Black Dragon King doesn't come, Changhoja won't have to sacrifice himself.

"Alright, I'll do that."

"Good. Then I'll go rescue Kim Yeon soon. Hongbeom, you… follow me for a moment. There's something we need to check together."

"Yes, understood."

After asking Jeon Myeonghun to rescue Oh Hyeon-seok, I took Hongbeom and left the basin.

"Follow me."

Whoosh!

Using the Shrinking Earth Technique, I took Hongbeom and headed to the place where the woman from Taeyeolsa had fled.

Whoosh, whoosh!

After running for dozens of miles, I finally found her presence. The woman from Taeyeolsa had used the Earth Escape Technique to dig into the ground and hide about two hundred miles away from the battlefield with the Taesu.

Rumble—

Using my spiritual power, I pulled her out from underground.

"Eek! Seniors! Please spare me! I've mastered the Incombustible Technique, so even if you consume me as a pill, it won't help your cultivation!"

"…."

As soon as she was pulled to the surface and saw us emitting spiritual power, she collapsed and screamed. Her reaction was still very different from the bold Taeyeoljeon of my previous life.

I looked at Hongbeom and asked.

"Hongbeom, what do you think of this woman?"

Hongbeom stroked his beard and looked at me with a puzzled expression.

"Hmm, she smells. It seems she doesn't wash."

"…."

"…? Ah, sorry. Are you planning to take her as a concubine?"

I felt a chill down my spine for some reason. Hongbeom's reaction had changed.

"…Hongbeom."

"Yes?"

"Don't you have any other thoughts?"

"Hmm… It seems she's mastered the Incombustible Technique, but her spiritual power looks a bit unique."

"…."

He seemed completely uninterested, treating her as if she were an inanimate object.

"No, I mean… don't you feel like you want to marry her or suddenly confess your love to her?"

I asked while observing Hongbeom closely. However, Hongbeom looked rather bewildered and said,

"Master… no matter how much I respect your wishes… marriage is a serious matter in life, so…."

"…You're a centipede demon, so your concept of marriage might be different from humans, right?"

Hearing the word 'centipede' and the talk about marriage, the woman's face turned pale.

"Seniors, I don't know what you like about me, but I can't satisfy a centipede senior. Please, let me go!"

Her reaction was also different. In my previous life, Taeyeoljeon didn't accept Hongbeom's courtship, but she blushed and felt a flutter in her heart. However, in this life, she seemed genuinely terrified and disgusted at the thought of marrying a centipede demon.

Hongbeom frowned as if he didn't like her expression either.

"…Sorry, Master. Although I'm a centipede, I've been influenced a lot by human concepts while being with you. And above all… she smells too bad. Even if you told me to eat her…."

"Eek! Please don't eat me!"

"…Even if you told me to eat her, the smell would make me spit her out. Master, you don't really intend to marry me to her, do you…?"

Both Hongbeom and the woman from Taeyeolsa looked at me with desperate eyes.

"Seniors, I'm a celibate, so I decided not to marry! Besides, as you can see, I'm smelly and lazy, so I can't do anything!"

"…Master… I know it might sound funny coming from a centipede, but I really want to meet someone I love and get married… but this is just…."

I nodded, holding my head.

"Alright. I wasn't planning to tell you to get married."

"Thank you, seniors!"

"Thank you, Master!"

They finally rejoiced and bowed to me.

"…Well, the reason I came here… give me some of your Incombustible Technique manuals."

"Incombustible Technique manuals?"

"Yes. The ones left in Taeyeolsa."

"Ah! I brought all my possessions with me during the recent natural disaster, so I have them here!"

She used the Earth Escape Technique to pull out a bundle from underground.

'…How poor must she be to not even have a storage artifact.'

I clicked my tongue as I saw her packing her belongings in a bundle like a mortal, without even a common storage artifact. It seemed that the small bundle contained all her possessions. She rummaged through the bundle and took out three jade slips that were worn out and tattered.

"…."

I looked at the jade slips with a stiff face.

'They're different.'

The Incombustible Techniques that could be practiced up to the Fusion Stage in my previous life were different. These techniques were limited to the Great Origin Stage at best. Of course, the names like the Seven Fire Kings were the same. Golden God King, Red Annihilation King, Glass Tiger King, Silver Blue King, Cold Light King, Agate Increase King, and Black Obsidian Demon King, and the concept of the Future King. The symbols they represented also matched what Taeyeoljeon had explained. But I noticed something strange.

"Hey, what happens to the Seven Fire Kings after they save all sentient beings?"

"Ah… the Seven Fire Kings? Uh… what was it…."

She scratched her head, seemingly unable to recall the contents of the Incombustible Technique she had learned. As I frowned, Hongbeom threatened her.

"The Master is curious. Answer quickly."

She shrank and spoke as if she had remembered.

"Eek. Sorry. The Seven Fire Kings are said to shed their skins in the lotus after saving all sentient beings."

"Shed their skins in the lotus? What happens next?"

"After that… there's no transmission…."

"…What is the relationship between the Future King and the Seven Fire Kings?"

"Um, I don't know…."

As veins bulged on my forehead, she spoke with a tearful face.

"Seniors! It's not that I can't remember, but I really haven't learned it! The Future King is just a symbol of future hope, and it doesn't hold a significant place in the Incombustible Technique! Depending on the region, there are stories that the Future King is the master, disciple, or relative of the Seven Fire Kings, or that they have no relationship at all, but these are all baseless. We don't pay much attention to the relationship between the Future King and the Seven Fire Kings. We just treat them as kings who are faithful to their own domains."

"…No relationship?"

"Yes, that's what my master taught me…."

"…."

Then why did Taeyeoljeon speak so confidently about the Future King to me?

"…Are these all the techniques of Taeyeolsa?"

"Yes."

"Are there any techniques that can reach the Fusion Stage?"

"What? Haha, if there were, wouldn't I have become a Taesu long ago? Ah… sorry. I didn't mean to be sarcastic."

She scratched her head and spoke jokingly, but when Hongbeom glared at her, she quickly bowed her head and shrank.

"These are all the techniques passed down in Taeyeolsa. I've never even seen techniques that reach the Fusion Stage…."

"…I see. And can I take these Incombustible Technique manuals? I have a place to research them."

"It would be an honor, seniors! It would be great if a high-level cultivator like you could learn them. And…."

"And?"

"If possible, could you take me as a disciple…?"

At her words, Hongbeom clicked his tongue and waved his hand.

"Master, this woman smells, seems untalented, and lacks determination. Don't take her."

Receiving Hongbeom's irritation, she prostrated herself and said,

"Sorry, I overstepped! Then, since you're taking the Incombustible Techniques… could you at least say you got them from Taeyeolsa… Ah, never mind. That was presumptuous of me."

Hongbeom, seemingly angry, exhaled venomously.

"Master, she keeps trying to use you to promote Taeyeolsa. She's lazy, untalented, and smells bad, yet she's cunning and shameless."

Hearing Hongbeom's words, she looked as if she was about to faint.

"It might be better to kill her."

It seemed her attitude of trying to use me to promote Taeyeolsa had angered Hongbeom, who rarely showed such anger.

"…Enough. Don't do that."

I waved my hand. Although I didn't like her trying to use me, I wasn't angry because it seemed she was trying to revive Taeyeolsa.

"And I'll speak well of Taeyeolsa, so don't worry. And take this as payment for the manuals."

I threw her a storage artifact filled with spirit stones, and she prostrated herself in gratitude. I took the manuals and headed to Cheonin Island with Hongbeom. I planned to go to Kim Yeon.

'…The eight Taesu became seven, and the eight chapters of the Donghwa also became seven.'

The two events were related. I gritted my teeth.

'What on earth happened….'

I glanced at Hongbeom following me. I was certain from his attitude towards her today. Hongbeom didn't love the nun. He was infatuated with 'some entity that possessed that woman.' What was the entity imitating Taeyeoljeon, and why did Hongbeom go mad for it, even defying my orders to confess his love? And if I had mastered the Incombustible Techniques that entity gave me, what would have happened to me?

With complex thoughts, I headed towards Gwaegun.
