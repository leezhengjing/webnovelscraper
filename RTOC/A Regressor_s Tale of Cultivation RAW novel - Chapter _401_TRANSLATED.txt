**Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 401: With the Wind (4)**

Step, step….

I slowly walked towards the palace and touched one of its pillars. Unlike before, one of the pillars was missing.

‘Did Liulin use it to refine the Yin Sea Ghost Jade?’

To think that such a precious material had to be used to this extent for the progress of the Yin Sea Ghost Jade, it was honestly a ridiculously inefficient technique. Although its power seemed outstanding, seeing Liulin’s mental state deteriorate made me lose any desire for it. Whether it was due to the Yin Sea Ghost Jade or external interference, it was clear that the technique did not help in maintaining one’s mental state, unlike the Taishan Emperor Technique or its reverse.

I entered the palace. The structure was identical to what I had seen when I entered the inner part of the Fenglai Kingdom. However, unlike the palace in the Fenglai Kingdom, which was filled with local specialties, decorations, and artifacts, this palace was desolate, with only a few documents that seemed to be written by Liulin scattered around.

I also checked the library where I had seen the Yuho Deokje Saseo, but it was empty. Everything I had seen in the Fenglai Kingdom seemed to be an illusion.

After observing the palace for a while, I realized something.

‘This palace… is connected to the Salt Mountain of Fenglai Island.’

It was a fact I could discern due to my eighty years of communion with the Salt Mountain. This connection was very faint, making it difficult to detect.

‘And if it’s connected to the Salt Mountain….’

I sat cross-legged in the center of the palace, where the throne of the Fenglai Kingdom’s queen originally stood, and chanted the incantation of the Reverse Taishan Emperor Technique.

Wooong!

The palace of the Yin Sea shone brightly. And then, at some point.

Wooong!

The palace of the Yin Sea shone white-hot, and I felt my consciousness being pulled somewhere. The next moment.

Waggle, waggle, waggle—

I slowly opened my eyes.

“…This place….”

It was noisy around me. Although I had been alone inside the palace, now countless officials were looking at me with astonished expressions, their sharp gazes piercing me.

“You crazy demon king! What are you doing? Get down immediately!”

“This, this, this blasphemy!!!”

They were all shouting at me. At first, I couldn’t understand what they were saying due to my disoriented senses, but I soon grasped their meaning.

Wriggle, wriggle….

Something wriggled beneath my buttocks. I hurriedly stood up and looked at the throne. The queen of the Fenglai Kingdom was sitting there, glaring at me with a slightly reddened face.

“…Two people suddenly appeared and sat on me, almost suffocating me. Why have you appeared again? What do you want this time?”

“Um, please wait a moment.”

I felt a headache coming on. After a while, my headache subsided, and the illusion before my eyes blurred, returning me to the empty palace.

“…I see.”

I had been startled and stopped chanting the incantation of the Reverse Taishan Emperor Technique.

‘If I chant the incantation of the Reverse Taishan Emperor Technique, I cross over to that world, and if I stop, I return.’

It seemed to be a special situation caused by the separation of the Yin Sea palace and the Salt Mountain of Fenglai Island. Smiling at the amusing situation, I stepped outside the palace. And then it happened.

Zing!

“…!”

I suddenly felt a severe headache.

“Ugh… What is this?”

It wasn’t just a pain in my seated clone; even my main body on Fenglai Island was in agony. I tried to shift my consciousness to my main body to find out what was happening. And then, I immediately understood.

“…Three days?”

I was dumbfounded as I regained consciousness on the Salt Mountain. In the brief moment I had entered the Fenglai Kingdom and opened my eyes, three days had passed. This phenomenon was not unfamiliar.

‘…When I met [him].’

Although I couldn’t remember the name, I recalled meeting [a certain being] in the lowest layer of the Phoenix Pearl. I had endured over ten years there, but when I regained consciousness, only a short time had passed. The phenomenon of space-time distortion.

This was…

‘Related to a True Immortal!’

I could tell at a glance.

‘It must be the master of the Salt Mountain or something related to him.’

I was afraid. But it wasn’t a situation where I could run away out of fear. Gritting my teeth, I shifted my consciousness back to my seated clone and inspected Liulin’s treasure vault.

‘…The corpse of Jinmayeol is gone.’

Frowning, I left the vault. Outside the treasure vault, only Baeklin and Yukyo remained. The entire Tumah Pirate Crew had disappeared.

“…What happened?”

“Well… The Tumah Pirate Crew took Jinmayeol’s corpse and fled. They probably thought you would kill them all once you emerged.”

“So they ran away.”

I felt a headache coming on.

‘Damn it, I needed their ship to move Baeklin….’

With them gone, there was nothing I could do. Although I could track them if they surfaced, thanks to the modifications Northward Flower had made to their ship, I noticed something strange and asked them.

“…What about Liulin? What happened to Liulin?”

The fight between Kim Younghoon and Liulin seemed evenly matched, but in a prolonged battle, Kim Younghoon would lose. After all, Kim Younghoon was just a clone. So, if Liulin had defeated Kim Younghoon’s clone, he should have immediately invaded this deep-sea island using the teleportation array, right?

However, Baeklin and Yukyo exchanged glances and spoke in a bewildered tone.

“Well… Master, you can draw upon the power of your main body even with your clone, right? Could you momentarily draw upon your main body’s senses?”

Following Baeklin’s suggestion, I drew upon the power and consciousness of my main body through the Total Heaven Sword. And when I swept my consciousness over the deep-sea island.

“…!!!!!”

I was struck dumb. The deep-sea island, which should have been fixed in one place, was ‘moving.’ No, it was slowly decelerating, but it was definitely still moving.

“How… How is this possible!?”

“We don’t know either. The distance between the middle region of the Dragon Island and this deep-sea island has increased, making it impossible to use the teleportation array, so we’re trapped here.”

“This is….”

Panicking, I spread my consciousness further to understand how the deep-sea island was moving. And then, I realized something.

* * *

Wooong—

Fenglai Island. Above the Salt Mountain.

I shifted my consciousness to my main body and began chanting the incantation of the Reverse Taishan Emperor Technique along with my clone on the deep-sea island.

Wooong!

The Salt Mountain I was sitting on began to emit light. And the Yin Sea palace on the deep-sea island also began to emit light. This time, since I wasn’t inside the Yin Sea palace, my consciousness wasn’t pulled into that world. However, I could clearly feel it.

‘They are pulling each other.’

And the force was unexpectedly immense. Smiling wryly, I said.

“…I don’t need the help of the Tumah Pirate Crew.”

The gravitational pull between the Salt Mountain of Fenglai Island and the Yin Sea palace of the deep-sea island was so immense that the entire deep-sea island, along with Baeklin, Yukyo, and my clone, was being pulled towards this side. I sent a message to Guangyin and the entire Fenglai Island. Now, all that was left was to wait for the convergence and escape from Fenglai Island.

* * *

Upon hearing my explanation, Baeklin and Yukyo’s eyes widened, and they asked.

“Are we really returning to the sect, Master!?”

“Are we really going back to the Fenglai Kingdom?”

I nodded to both of their questions. They seemed momentarily satisfied with my answer but then exchanged glances again. Sighing, I read the subtle emotions between them. It seemed that for them, the question of ‘where’ to return to was more important than just returning.

* * *

“…So, we’ve resolved all the issues facing our sect for now.”

I summarized the recent events to everyone in the Wujigyo Sect’s conference room.

“That’s a relief. Although I fought Liulin for a day and night and inflicted a fatal wound, it was ultimately the clone’s energy that did it. I was a bit worried….”

“Fortunately, it seems to have worked out well.”

Kim Younghoon sighed in relief, and Oh Hyunseok agreed with him. Jeon Myunghoon nodded stoically, while Kim Yeon and Northward Flower both smiled faintly. Seoran looked disappointed after hearing about the situation between Yukyo and Baeklin, and Shiho glared at her.

“It’s a relief that it worked out. But there’s one more thing we need to discuss.”

I looked at Kim Younghoon, Seoran, Shiho, and Northward Flower.

“Conqueror King. You said there were no results from researching Fenglai Island yet, right?”

“Yes. We’ve examined the formations of Fenglai Island, but we couldn’t find any clues to rescue Cheongmunryeong.”

Northward Flower spoke with a regretful expression. Over the past eighty years, Northward Flower, along with Seoran and Shiho, had explored Fenglai Island to find a way to rescue Cheongmunryeong. However, they couldn’t find any clues. To obtain proper clues, we would either have to merge the Yin Sea palace and the Salt Mountain of Fenglai Island again or enter the illusion formation and gather information from the people of that world. Especially since the queen of the Fenglai Kingdom seemed to know something, asking her would be the most appropriate.

However, there was a problem with this. First, the first method.

“That deep-sea island… Was it called Aengryong Island? Although Aengryong Island is coming here quickly, the dimensional distance in the deep sea is too vast.”

We had no idea where that mysterious hand had thrown us. Considering the gravitational pull between the Salt Mountain and the palace, the speed at which they were approaching each other, and the dimensional gaps in the deep sea between Aengryong Island and Fenglai Island, it would take an enormous amount of time for Aengryong Island to reach here. Roughly….

“About seven years?”

This was because the deep sea of the High Power Realm was far more unstable than the chaotic regions of the Middle Realm. I had heard that in the chaotic regions, space often distorted, causing distances to lengthen or shorten. The entrance to the Jeomul Island of the Dragon Formation Immortal, where I had been last time, was close to a stable land, so it couldn’t be compared to a proper chaotic region. However, the deep sea of the High Power Realm was even more distorted. It wasn’t for nothing that even combined search teams had a fifty percent chance of getting lost in the deep sea. The only reason Aengryong Island and Fenglai Island were approaching quickly was due to the gravitational pull between them, which was why I estimated seven years. But seven years was still quite a long time. Northward Flower asked worriedly.

“Isn’t the grand event just around the corner in seven years?”

“Yes. So even if the palace merges with the Salt Mountain again, there won’t be enough time to investigate properly. Therefore….”

Kim Yeon’s face turned pale.

“It’s too dangerous, Brother Eunhyun!”

Her words made the others worry about me as well.

“That’s right, Seoeunhyun. Are you planning to enter the Fenglai Kingdom alone to investigate? It’s dangerous. And didn’t you say the time ratio is different in that world?”

“Yes, Eunhyun. If you fall asleep while entering the Guanghan Realm, there will be no answer.”

After listening to everyone, I looked at Kim Yeon.

“It’s okay. She will wake me up.”

I slowly explained my plan. I didn’t intend to just investigate without knowing the passage of time. Using the Mysterious Heart Connection Technique, I would partially link my mind with Kim Yeon’s. Then, I would enter the Fenglai Kingdom to gather information, and when the time approached, Kim Yeon would signal me through the Mysterious Heart Connection Technique. That way, I could exit the Fenglai Kingdom. That should work.

Kim Yeon bit her lip with a worried look. I didn’t want to take such a risk either. There was a chance that some strange effect could activate and erase my memory while I was inside. Although it seemed unlikely based on Yukyo’s description of the conditions for regaining consciousness, there was still some risk involved. But I shook my head firmly.

“…I’m sorry, everyone. But….”

I had to find a way to free Cheongmunryeong from the salt pillar. I couldn’t delay any longer. Cheongmunryeong was still trapped in that world, turned into a salt pillar. I couldn’t leave him like that forever. The High Power Realm was particularly responsive to the Taishan Emperor Technique and the power of salt.

‘I must find out why while I’m still in this world.’

If not in the High Power Realm, there might be no other opportunity. Realizing my firm resolve, everyone sighed. Kim Yeon bit her lip, knowing she couldn’t stop me, and lowered her head.

“…Alright. If you must… then go.”

“…Thank you.”

I expressed my gratitude to her and the entire Wujigyo Sect.

* * *

Wooong—

With Kim Yeon’s Mysterious Heart Connection Technique attached to my mind, I stood in front of the Yin Sea palace. Although I was curious about the documents inside, this matter was more urgent.

“By the way, are you coming along too?”

I asked Yukyo, who was standing beside me.

“Of course. It’s my homeland.”

“….”

Yukyo had also decided to enter with me, citing her return to the Fenglai Kingdom. However, I looked at her and then at Baeklin.

“What about you, Baeklin?”

“…I… don’t know.”

Baeklin seemed to want Yukyo to take him along, but Yukyo didn’t beg him to come. She seemed to understand. Baeklin had too many precious people in this world.

“…Can’t you stay in this world with me, Princess?”

But Yukyo shook her head at Baeklin’s words.

“I’m sorry, Baeklin. That world is… truly my homeland.”

“….”

Baeklin hesitated, reluctant to follow her, and Yukyo gently touched his hand. After a moment of mutual touch, they separated.

‘…Is this the end?’

Feeling a sense of regret, I walked towards the palace. Yukyo walked with me. Placing my hand on her shoulder, I chanted the incantation of the Reverse Taishan Emperor Technique.

Wooong—

And as I stepped into the palace entrance.

Flash!

I felt my consciousness being pulled again, arriving in another world. The scenery changed, and I saw a new landscape. A corridor lined with countless soldiers. In front of them stood the queen of the Fenglai Kingdom, and Yukyo, whom I had been holding, had transformed from a fish-like mermaid into a beautiful human princess in ancient attire.

The queen of the Fenglai Kingdom wiped her tears as she looked at Yukyo.

“Welcome back, my daughter.”

“Mother!”

Yukyo hurriedly ran to the queen, and I watched their reunion for a moment. After a while, the queen of the Fenglai Kingdom looked at me and spoke.

“Although there was some commotion earlier, I’ll overlook it considering the circumstances. Anyway, you are the benefactors who brought my daughter back, so it would be dishonorable not to treat you properly. We will hold a banquet, so please enjoy yourselves.”

However, I shook my head and said.

“I didn’t bring the princess here to be treated to a banquet. I have something I want to know.”

I looked at the queen of the Fenglai Kingdom.

“Please tell me everything you know.”
