She felt a sense of panic. Crack! I immediately grabbed her arms. Taeyeoljeon burst into laughter, seemingly enjoying the situation, while I felt a cold sweat trickle down my back from the murderous intent I sensed. I tightened my grip even more. Clang! Her arms were severed as if cut by a sharp sword. Without hesitation, I used the basic technique of the Great Celestial Escape to unleash the integrated power from within my dantian and began my sword dance. A sword dance that would kill me if I didn't release my power! Anything less than this level of technique wouldn't suffice. My sword dance swept across her upper body, simultaneously blocking the flying willow leaf blade from behind. As I looked at the willow leaf blade, I recalled my fight with Jang Ik and decided not to attack Taeyeoljeon immediately but to retreat from the spot. Whoosh! I escaped from the Siundo and prepared another basic technique of Danak outside the human territory. And in that brief moment, a sense of regret echoed. A dense, pink spider web spread in all directions, ensnaring the spot where I had just been. If I had foolishly thought I had the upper hand and continued to attack her, I would have been crushed within the barrier created by the willow leaf blade.

As I gradually engaged with her, I began to understand the nature of her fighting spirit. 'She uses the willow leaf blade simply because she learned it from Jang Ik.' Most of her opponents likely mistook the willow leaf blade for her weapon and focused on it. However, having faced her in combat, I realized that she did not become a member of the Sim Clan through the blade techniques of the willow leaf blade. 'Was it called Simcheontanghwado?' I recalled the name of her ultimate technique that had echoed in my mind, feeling a chill run down my spine. 'If my guess is correct... Taeyeoljeon has probably reached the pinnacle of her mental cultivation technique.' For me, it was like mastering the Dragon Vein Qigong to reach the level of the Royal Court. She simply manifested techniques that matched her internal cultivation method as needed. The essence of her ultimate technique lay in the qigong itself.

Hummm! In the distance, the pink light that had been rising from the Siundo began to compress. It turned into a dark red light. Simultaneously, her mental energy echoed once more. Suddenly, as I faced her, I realized another thing. 'I see... The secret of her power lies there.' No matter how overwhelming one's power is, it is meaningless if it doesn't hit the target. Striking the opponent to bring them down—that is one of the essences of martial arts and combat. I used the formless sword of infinite freedom that ignores defense and evasion. Kim Younghoon used the speed of the Light Blade that was impossible to react to. Jang Ik used the destructive power of the Four Destruction Celestial Blade to 'pierce' the opponent. But her method was entirely different. Certain hit (必中). Her opponents could never evade her attacks. They had to block them head-on. I recalled that I couldn't evade her attacks. They were much slower than Kim Younghoon's, but I had to block them. The reason I couldn't evade even once during the battle was due to the nature of her Simcheontanghwado. Those who faced her mental cultivation technique would see their own potential reflected in her transparent mind. It wasn't just a mindless attack with destructive power; it was an attack that made the opponent face their own potential as if looking into a mirror. That was the essence of her Simcheontanghwado. 'It wasn't that I couldn't evade; if I had evaded, my mind would have gradually broken, increasing the chances of going berserk during the battle.' An ultimate technique that forces a direct confrontation. That was her fighting spirit. That was her martial art.

Crack, crack! I infused the explosive energy from within into my sword and looked at her. She also looked at me. Simcheontanghwado. The Sixth Flower (第六華) Manoseungcheonwang (瑪瑙憎天王). A wave of dark red light surged towards me like a sea of blood. I could feel it. If even a drop of the sea of blood touched my body, my entire skin would be peeled off. Though my skin could regenerate, the essence of the sea of blood was 'peeling.' It wasn't just the skin; the surface layer of my soul might be peeled off as well. My consciousness would disintegrate, my qi would scatter, and I would die. For those who perceive information through the realm of consciousness, it was the worst possible attack. 'Hmm? What is this?' I suddenly thought I had analyzed her attack too quickly. Unlike other attacks, this one felt strangely familiar. 'Why does it feel like I've seen this before...?' But I couldn't recall where I had seen it. 'No, now is not the time to think about that.' I thought of a way to counter Taeyeoljeon's attack. 'If it's an attack that disintegrates consciousness, counter it with something that can't be disintegrated.' If the sphere of chaos earlier was the worst match for Hyeonwon, this attack was one where Hyeonwon could have the upper hand. Of course, if it hit, it would be a different story, but Hyeonwon could easily erase this attack before it hit. Qi (氣) cannot be disintegrated. Qi, which contains all attributes, is complete in itself and cannot exist if its attributes are separated. On the contrary, Hyeonwon's Taesan Yeolje Gong, which forcibly disintegrates such qi, was a bizarre and grotesque technique. 'Qi (氣) is life, and life is history....' The history accumulated by a being cannot be changed. Sizzle! My sword began to be enveloped in a white mist. The power of the player mixed with the power of the Sim Clan inside the Great Celestial Escape. I took a step forward. Simultaneously, a single sword strike scattered in the frozen world. Boom! A person stored in the Myriad Connections Sword raised their hand. A drop of the sea of blood burst. This sword. Another person raised their hand. Two drops of the sea of blood burst. Three swords. Four swords. Five swords.... My sword shot out like a beam of light. The white sword strikes extended in all directions like the hands of a thousand-armed Guanyin, emitting beams of light. Countless beams of light clashed with the sea of blood, and each time, the connections in the Myriad Connections Sword raised their hands one by one. The drops of the sea of blood burst one by one, surely. In the sea of white mist, countless connections reached out their hands, erasing the sea of blood. How many times? I couldn't even count how many sword strikes I unleashed. Finally, I realized that I had exhausted all the power I had integrated and exploded within the Great Celestial Escape. Boom! But at the same time, I burst the last drop of the sea of blood. Sizzle― I had no strength left in my body. The Great Celestial Escape had to be used until all the strength in my body was exhausted, but as a result, I was completely powerless. Taeyeoljeon clicked her tongue as she looked at me. "No one other than my master and Hyeonwon has ever blocked the Sixth Flower like that... Impressive." I laughed through the pain that felt like my lungs were being squeezed. "It seems this isn't the usual way to counter it." My mind felt like it was shaking. I had squeezed out so much energy that I felt like I could cough up blood and die at any moment. Whoosh! Unable to maintain my energy, I began to fall from the sky. Outside the human territory, in the mountainous area filled with strange rocks. If I fell, I would be smashed to pieces. But I squeezed out the last bit of my strength and activated the circuit of the strange army I had laid in advance. My body, which could barely move, was forced to move like a puppet, amplifying the last drop of strength to protect my body. Boom! I collapsed completely, catching my breath. Fortunately, I didn't get smashed to pieces, but I was so weak that I couldn't even hold my sword. It was hard to breathe. Whoosh! Taeyeoljeon landed on the opposite peak of the mountain range where I had fallen and spoke. "Originally, it's not about blocking it in such a brute force way. You endure the disintegration of your soul by confronting it head-on. If you make your consciousness close to nothingness and reach emptiness, you can ignore the Sixth Flower. My master could counter it that way, but he was so annoyed that he destroyed the entire ultimate technique. Hyeonwon's Taesan Yeolje Gong was... too much of a bad match, so it was countered. And you're the first to burst every drop of the sea of blood. I can't even grasp how you did it...." "...Honor...." I couldn't continue speaking and gasped for breath. It was hard to utter a single word. I felt like I had aged a thousand years in an instant. And at the same time, I realized something. An ultimate technique that forces the opponent to face themselves. 'I see....' Simcheontanghwado is.... "...Those... ultimate techniques...." I had gained an understanding of her ultimate technique and felt compelled to express my thoughts. Using mental energy would squeeze my upper dantian, so it was better to speak with my vocal cords. "Those techniques... are not meant to kill the opponent...." Techniques that separate bone and flesh, peel off the skin, and twist the entire meridians to death—these terrifying techniques, when experienced directly, revealed their true nature. 'Nothingness.... If one becomes nothingness, all these attacks are nullified....' An ultimate technique that forces the opponent into a state of emptiness to grant them enlightenment. That was her Simcheontanghwado. I spoke through blood, sharing my realization with her. Taeyeoljeon seemed genuinely surprised. "Impressive.... No one has ever realized that in a single duel. Even the geniuses of the Sim Clan couldn't grasp it. Only my master noticed the essence and got beaten up for being rude.... Haha, interesting. You...." Her eyes sparkled with interest. "How much hardship have you endured? It must be at least a thousand years of suffering and focusing on a single thought to gain such insight. What single thought have you pursued so relentlessly?" Clatter, clatter, clatter.... I felt my body clattering as it stood up. It wasn't my will. 'Ah... I see.' My body was practically in a state of suspended animation, with only my consciousness awake. Yet, my body stood up. Sizzle! At that moment, I felt a strange sense of unity with the formless sword, experiencing a void I had never felt before. It was a true unity with the formless sword that I had never achieved before. From within my emptied body, the heart of the formless sword filled me and moved my body. I recalled what Brother Younghoon had said. Before I obtained the formless sword. When I was training at the Secheon Peak. He said he saw me get up and train according to my daily routine even after I fainted. But I couldn't remember training when my memory was cut off. So, who moved my body back then? 'I see. You have been with me since then.' Even martial arts have a heart. What I did when I ascended to the Heavenly Peak was not to bestow a heart but to awaken it. And the beginning of this heart was something very familiar to me. The formless sword spoke for the first time, not saying 'cut' but something else. ―Jo Mun Do Seok Sa Ga Eui (朝聞道夕死可矣). "...If you hear the Dao in the morning, you can die in the evening." I conveyed the words of the formless sword with my mouth and smiled. "I have only strived to gain one more Dao in life." "What is your Dao?" "Myriad Connections (萬象因緣)." "...." Taeyeoljeon stood there for a moment, then she planted the willow leaf blade into the peak and began to form a seal. Hummm! The figure that had been poorly formed due to her lack of skill in magic arts began to take shape more clearly. Taeyeoljeon's main body, far away, consumed her true power to reveal her form more distinctly. She appeared as a nun with a shaved head, wearing a kasaya. She clasped her hands together and bowed to me. "I apologize for trying to teach you presumptuously. Please accept my apology." "Thanks to you, I have gained great enlightenment. No apology is necessary." Thanks to her, I learned the true way to use the Heavenly Peak. I moved in the state of complete void, united with the formless sword, and accepted her bow. The celestial energy of the Celestial Clan and the Earth Clan draws infinite power from the natural world by eliminating the boundaries between the microcosm within the body and the natural world outside. However, the third stage of the Sim Clan's manifestation. My Moon Dao Heavenly Peak was the exact opposite. It was about drawing infinite power from one's martial arts, which had gained a heart from within the soul. That was the true way to use the Moon Dao Heavenly Peak that I realized today. She shook her head and said, "With your level of cultivation, you would have realized it soon even without me. I respect your will." Hoo.... I took a deep breath. Through the channel of my will, I felt 'power' welling up from deep within my mind. I couldn't tell where this power came from. Perhaps the day I find out the source of this power will be the day I understand what the heart is. Normally, this power can only be used for one's manifestation. A typical member of the Sim Clan would use their manifestation to fight the enemy even as their body was being destroyed. But thanks to my formless sword, the 'power' that stayed within the realm of the soul descended to the realm of qi, becoming vitality that energized my entire body. Seeing this, Taeyeoljeon chuckled. "Truly amazing. It's not a power meant to be used that way, yet you can cross realms to make it possible... Your enlightenment is also interesting." She waited for me to recover and then spoke. "We've clashed six techniques so far. Shall we try the remaining four?" "Sounds good." She threw the willow leaf blade she had planted beside her into the sky. Simultaneously, the surroundings darkened. Simcheontanghwado. The Seventh Flower (第七華). "Heukyomacheonwang (黑曜魔天王)." As if showing respect to me, she uttered the name of the ultimate technique with her mouth instead of letting it echo in her mind, and began to unfold the technique. It felt like black glass was filling the world. The smooth surface of obsidian covered all directions, and I saw countless reflections of myself in the black glass. Each reflection had eyes glistening with evil emotions. It was a technique that evoked the heart demon (心魔) even more blatantly than the sixth technique. 'A kind of final test.' The previous six ultimate techniques made the opponent experience emptiness, and the final technique completely struck the realm of the soul. If one couldn't embody emptiness, their soul would shatter like glass. I immediately noticed the essence of this ultimate technique and calmed my mind. This ultimate technique was purely an attack on the realm of the soul, without involving the realm of qi. Even Hyeonwon couldn't disassemble this attack with Taesan Yeolje Gong. It was a kind of illusion. However, realizing it was an illusion, I felt a strange sensation. 'Illusions never work on me....' But thinking about it, I felt something strange. '...? What is this? No, there's no basis for saying illusions don't work on me. But this feeling is....' I felt a strange sense of incongruity lingering in my mind, but even when I observed myself with the Myriad Connections Sword or the formless sword, I found nothing wrong. 'I don't know. For now, let's break the illusion in front of me.' I calmed my mind and raised my mental image. There was no basis for saying illusions didn't work on me, but I was confident I wouldn't be swayed by the heart demon. Sizzle! Soon, the scenery reflected in the black glass began to change. Instead of countless reflections of myself with evil emotions, it was a mountain. It was a mountain made of glass. The place where I draw my 'power.' I was drawing power from a place at the center of this mountain, a place even I couldn't penetrate. 'Perhaps... finding the source of that power is the path I must take.' In the black glass, the mountain of glass was reflected. The mountain of glass reflected the black glass again, starting an infinite reflection. And at the end of that reflection, I could see the owner of the black glass, Taeyeoljeon. The black glass and the colorless glass looked at each other. 'This is her mental image....' Inside her was a single tanghwa (幀畫圖). Seven giant heavenly kings (天王) were sitting in a circle under a white lotus, wearing benevolent smiles. Each of them looked like a giant god capable of supporting the sky, but none of them left their seats and sat quietly in a lotus position. Under the lotus was not a well but a hot hellfire, yet strangely, no one was suffering in it. The mysterious tanghwa looked incredibly sacred. Strangely, there seemed to be a place on the lotus where someone could sit, but no one was sitting there. Sizzle! Before I knew it, I came out of her mental image and met her eyes again. "Impressive. The owner of the colorless glass." "I should say the same. Compared to the beings inside you, I am lacking." It was clear she had entered my mental image, yet unlike others who had entered my mental image before, she seemed unscathed. "Hyeonwon was most terrified of Heukyomacheonwang, but you don't seem to fear it at all. Those who have never deceived themselves are free from his gaze. There's no point in exchanging more techniques. Take care of your body. I concede." Taeyeoljeon smiled and sat down. I took a deep breath and began to heal my body and internal injuries by drawing celestial energy. At the same time, I asked about the beings I saw in her mental image. "...Who are those beings?" Having experienced the gaze of true immortals a few times, I could tell. They were undoubtedly transcendent beings and real gods. Taeyeoljeon was practically worshipping those gods within herself. "You said you ascended from the lower world, right? Then you might not know. They are fictional characters that only appear in the myths of the Buddhist martial arts found in the Great Middle Realm. Since the lower world only has the Daoist martial arts, especially those from the Sea of Immortals, you wouldn't know about Buddhist martial arts. They are known as the Seven Flower Kings (七華王), fictional beings who descend to the mortal world to grant enlightenment." "Buddhist martial


Novel Translator:
I sensed her surprise through her mental aura. Crack! I immediately grabbed her arms. Tae Yeol-jeon let out a cry of admiration, laughing joyfully, while I, feeling the intense killing intent from behind, tightened my grip. Snap! Her arms were severed as if cut by a sharp sword. Without hesitation, I exploded the power I had consolidated within the essence through the Great Celestial Escape and began my sword dance. A sword dance where I would die if I didn’t release the power! Nothing less would suffice. My sword dance swept over her upper body while simultaneously blocking the leaf blade that flew from behind. 

As I faced the leaf blade, I recalled my fight with Jang Ik and decided to retreat from the spot without attacking Tae Yeol-jeon further. Swoosh! I escaped from Syuun Island and prepared another Danak technique outside the human territory. In that brief moment, I heard a mental aura echoing in disappointment. 

Thick, pink spider webs bloomed everywhere, encircling the spot where I had just been. If I had foolishly thought I had the upper hand and continued to attack her, I would have been crushed within the barrier created by the spiritual veins of the leaf blade. 

As I gradually engaged with her, I could sense the essence of her battle spirit. ‘She uses the leaf blade simply because she learned it from Jang Ik.’ Most of her opponents likely mistook the leaf blade for her main weapon, focusing on it. But having faced her, I knew she hadn’t become a Shimzok by mastering the leaf blade’s techniques. 

‘She called it the Heartful Celestial Painting Blade?’ I recalled the name of her ultimate technique, which echoed through her mental aura, sending shivers down my spine. ‘If my guess is correct… Tae Yeol-jeon has reached her level purely through heart techniques.’ 

In my case, it was like mastering the Dragon Vein Qi Technique and reaching the pinnacle of the Jade Spring Forest. She implemented techniques that matched her inner strength and attributes as needed. The essence of her ultimate technique lay in the Qi itself.

Wooong! From afar, the pink light that had been blooming on Syuun Island began to compress. It turned into a crimson light. Simultaneously, her mental aura echoed once again. Suddenly, I realized another thing as I faced her. ‘I see… the secret of her power lies there.’ 

No matter how overwhelming the power, it means nothing if it doesn’t hit. Striking the opponent accurately and felling them—that’s the essence of martial arts and combat. 

I wielded the formless sword of infinite freedom, Kim Young-hoon wielded the speed-blinding light blade, and Jang Ik wielded the Sa Bo Myeol Cheon Do with destructive power that made defense meaningless, using methods to 'embed' the attack into the opponent. 

But her approach was entirely different. **Inevitable Strike**. Her opponent could never evade her attack. They could only block it head-on. I remembered how I couldn’t evade her attacks, even though they were much slower than Kim Young-hoon's. The reason I had to block every time was due to the property of her Heartful Celestial Painting Blade.

Those who faced her heart techniques would reflect on their own potential in front of her transparent heart. It wasn’t just a brute force attack; it made the opponent confront their potential. That was the essence of her Heartful Celestial Painting Blade. 

‘It wasn’t that I couldn’t evade. If I had, my heart would have gradually broken down, and I might have faced inner demons during the battle.’

A technique that forced a head-on confrontation. That was her battle spirit. That was her martial arts. 

Crunch, crack! I infused my sword with the exploding energy from within and looked at her. She looked back at me.

Heartful Celestial Painting Blade. Sixth Move: Agate Hatred Heavenly King. 

A crimson wave unfolded like a sea of blood, engulfing me. I could feel it. If even a single drop of this sea touched my body, it would peel off my entire skin. 

Regeneration of the skin was one thing, but the essence of this sea of blood was 'peeling off.' It wouldn’t just peel off my skin; it might strip the surface layer of my soul. My consciousness would disintegrate, my Qi would collapse, and I would die as my essence scattered.

It was an attack that boasted the worst compatibility for ascetics who gathered information through their consciousness. 

‘Huh? What is this?’ 

I thought I had analyzed her attack too quickly. Unlike the other attacks, this one felt oddly familiar. 

‘Why does this feel like something I’ve seen before…?’ But I couldn’t remember where I had seen it.

‘Enough. Now’s not the time to think about this.’ 

I considered a countermeasure for Tae Yeol-jeon’s attack. 

‘If the attack disintegrates consciousness, counter it with something it cannot disintegrate.’ 

The previous chaos sphere had the worst compatibility with Hyun-won. This attack, on the other hand, was one Hyun-won could easily counter with his Tai Shan Rejection Technique, though it would be a different story if it hit.

Qi cannot be disintegrated. Containing all properties, Qi is complete and cannot exist by losing any attributes. Tai Shan Rejection Technique, which forcibly disintegrates such Qi, was a bizarre and strange method. 

‘Qi is life, and life is history…’ The history accumulated through existence could never change.

Swish, swish, swish! 

A white mist enveloped my sword. The essence of a sage’s power mixed with the Heavenly Celestial Heart from within the Great Celestial Escape. 

I took a step forward. Simultaneously, I scattered my sword in a still world.

Boom! 

At the first sword strike, a figure from the Wanxiang Inyeondo raised their hand. A drop of blood burst. With the second strike, another figure raised their hand. Two drops of blood burst. Three swords, four swords, five swords…

My sword emitted beams of light like a thousand-handed Avalokitesvara, extending in all directions. Countless beams clashed with the sea of blood, and each time, a figure from Wanxiang Inyeondo raised their hand.

The drops of blood burst one by one. In a sea of white mist, countless figures raised their hands, erasing the sea of blood.

I struck countless times, so many I couldn’t count. Finally, I realized the power from the Great Celestial Escape had been exhausted.

Pop! 

But at the same time, I burst the last drop of the sea of blood.

Hiss― 

I had no strength left. The Great Celestial Escape drained all my energy, leaving me utterly powerless. Tae Yeol-jeon clicked her tongue, seeing me in that state.

“Only my master and Hyun-won have blocked the Sixth Move like that… amazing.”

I laughed through the suffocating pain in my lungs.

“Originally, this technique isn’t meant to be countered like this, is it?”

My vision wavered, and I felt like I would cough up blood and die at any moment. 

Swiish— I couldn’t maintain my balance and began to fall. Outside the human territory in the Yun-do area, a mountainous region full of strange rocks. If I fell, I would be crushed.

But I squeezed out my last bit of strength and activated the Puppet Circuit I had prepared. My body, unable to move, forced itself to move like a puppet, amplifying the last drop of strength to protect me.

Thud! 

I collapsed entirely, catching my breath. I didn’t turn into a pile of flesh, but I was utterly powerless, even unable to hold a sword. Breathing was hard. 

Thud! Tae Yeol-jeon landed on the opposite peak and spoke.

“The proper way is to endure the disintegration of your soul by facing it head-on. If you reach a state close to emptiness, you can ignore the Sixth Move. My master could counter it, but he destroyed the whole technique in anger, saying it was insolent. Hyun-won’s Tai Shan Rejection Technique has extreme compatibility, so it was inevitably countered. But bursting each drop of the sea of blood… you’re the first. Even I don’t understand how you did it.”

“…An… honor….”

I couldn’t speak properly and gasped for breath. It felt like I aged a thousand years in an instant. Simultaneously, I realized something. A technique that forced the opponent to confront themselves.

‘I see….’ The Heartful Celestial Painting Blade…

“…Those… techniques…”

I struggled to speak, feeling the need to express my insight. Speaking through mental aura was too draining, so using my voice was better.

“They… aren’t meant to… kill…”

The techniques that separated bone from flesh, peeled skin, twisted meridians to kill, seemed terrifying, but I knew. ‘Emptiness… Each technique, if the opponent reaches a state of emptiness, all attacks would nullify….’

A technique that forces the opponent into a state of emptiness to teach them enlightenment. That was her Heartful Celestial Painting Blade.

I spoke through blood, explaining what I had realized. Tae Yeol-jeon seemed genuinely surprised.

“Incredible… No one has realized that in a single spar. Even the top geniuses of Shimzok didn’t. Only my master noticed and got angry, beating me up… Hoo-hoo, interesting. You…”

Her eyes sparkled.

“How much hardship have you endured? Only an insight gained through over a thousand years of suffering and focusing on one thought. What thought have you adhered to so steadfastly?”

Clank, clank, clank.

 My body began to move shakily. It wasn’t my will. ‘Ah… I see.’ 

My body was barely conscious, almost in a vegetative state. Yet it stood up. 

Swish! 

I felt an empty void and a peculiar sense of unity. It was an unprecedented unity with the formless sword. Within the emptied body, the formless sword’s heart filled it, moving my body. 

I remembered Hyungnim’s words before obtaining the formless sword. While training at Mount Chul-yeon, he mentioned I would wake up and continue training as if nothing had happened. But I couldn’t remember the training.

‘So, you were with me even then.’ 

Martial arts have a heart. All I did was awaken it, not give it a heart. The start of this heart felt very familiar.

The formless sword spoke for the first time without saying 'slash.' 

―To hear the Way in the morning and die in the evening is fine.

“…To gain the Way in the morning, it’s fine to die in the evening.”

I conveyed the formless sword’s words and smiled.

“I have only strived to gain one more path in life.”

“What is your path?”

“Wanxiang Inyeon.”

“….”

Tae Yeol-jeon stood for a moment, then planted her leaf blade into the peak and began forming hand seals.

Wooong! Her projection, which couldn’t maintain its form properly, gradually became clearer. 

Her true form, dressed as a nun, revealed itself. She clasped her hands together and bowed to me.

“I apologize for presumptuously trying to teach you. Please accept my apology.”

“I have gained great insight, thanks to you. No apology needed.”

Thanks to her, I discovered the true use of the Heaven's Formidable Sword. 

I moved, unified with the formless sword, fully drained but in a state of emptiness, and received her bow.

Heavenly Qi practitioners remove the boundaries between their inner cosmos and the celestial environment, drawing infinite power from the celestial energy. However, the third stage of Shimzok's manifestation was the opposite. The manifestation of Moon’s Formidable Sword drew infinite power from the soul's depths. 

For the first time, I understood the use of Moon’s Formidable Sword.

She shook her head.

“With your level of cultivation, you would have realized it soon. I respect your will.”

I sighed. I felt a surge of power from deep within my mind. I didn’t know the source of this power. Perhaps understanding the source would clarify the nature of the mind itself.

Normally, this power can only be used as the manifestation one has studied. Most Shimzok would use this power to resist the enemy, even as their body deteriorates. But through the formless sword, the power of the soul descended to the level of Qi, rejuvenating my entire body. 

Tae Yeol-jeon chuckled.

“Truly amazing. That power isn’t meant to be used like that, yet you transcend the levels to make it possible… Your enlightenment is intriguing.”

She waited for me to recover and spoke.

“We’ve exchanged six techniques. Shall we continue for the remaining four?”

“Let’s.”

She threw her leaf blade into the air. Suddenly, the surroundings darkened. 

Heartful Celestial Painting Blade. Seventh Move:

“Obsidian Demon Heavenly King.”

As a mark of respect, she spoke the technique's name aloud rather than conveying it through mental aura. 

It felt like black glass filled the space, its smooth surface reflecting countless versions of me, each with eyes gleaming with malevolent intent. This move was more explicitly designed to evoke inner demons than the sixth move.

‘A final trial.’

The previous six moves experienced emptiness, and the final move attacked the soul’s essence, shattering it if one couldn’t embody emptiness. 

I realized the essence of this technique and calmed my mind. This move was purely an attack on the soul’s essence, devoid of Qi. Even Hyun-won couldn’t dismantle this with Tai Shan Rejection Technique. It was an illusion.

But, knowing it was an illusion, I felt a strange sensation. 

‘Illusions don’t work on me….’

However, I felt something was off. 

‘…? What is this feeling? No, there’s no basis for saying illusions don’t work on me. But this sensation…’

I felt a peculiar dissonance in my mind, but even examining myself through Wanxiang Inyeondo and the formless sword revealed nothing wrong.

‘I don’t know. For now, let’s break this illusion.’

I calmed my mind and raised my heart. The confidence that illusions didn’t work was baseless, but I was confident I wouldn’t be swayed by inner demons.

Swish, swish, swish!

The scenery within the black glass began to change. No longer reflected versions of me, but mountains. 

A mountain made of glass. It was where I drew my strength. At the center of this mountain, I was drawing strength from somewhere unreachable, even by myself.

‘Perhaps… finding the source of this power is my path.’

The glass mountain reflected in the black glass. The glass mountain reflected the black glass, creating infinite reflections. At the end of these reflections, I saw the master of the black glass: Tae Yeol-jeon.

Black glass and colorless glass reflected each other. 

‘This is her inner landscape….’

Her inner landscape was a painting. Seven great heavenly kings sat in a grand painting, drawing circles below a white lotus with kind smiles. Each one could support the heavens, yet they sat quietly in lotus positions, not leaving their spots.

Below the lotus was a fiery hell, but no one seemed to suffer there. The strange painting was overwhelmingly sacred. Oddly, there seemed to be a spot on the lotus for someone to sit, but no one was there.

Swish, swish, swish!

I returned from her inner landscape and faced her again.

“Amazing. Master of the colorless glass.”

“I should say that. Compared to those within you, I am lacking.”

It was clear she had entered my inner landscape, but unlike others who suffered, she seemed unaffected.

“Hyun-won feared the Obsidian Demon Heavenly King the most, yet you don’t fear it at all. Those who have never deceived themselves are free from its gaze. There’s no point in exchanging more moves. Take your time to recover. I’ve lost.”

Tae Yeol-jeon sat with a smile. I took a deep breath, drawing in celestial energy to heal my body and recover from internal injuries. 

I asked about the beings I saw in her inner landscape.

“…Who are they?”

Having encountered transcendental beings before, I could tell they were some form of deities. Tae Yeol-jeon seemed to revere them within herself.

“You said you achieved immortality in the lower realm, correct? Then you might not know. They are mythical figures in Buddhist cultivation found in the Grand Central Realm. The lower realms, especially those from the Subsea, know little of Buddhist cultivation. They are the Seven Flower Kings, mythical beings who bring enlightenment to the secular world.”

“Buddhist cultivation…?”

“Yes. Rarely found in the Celestial Realm, it’s overshadowed by Daoist cultivation in the Grand Central Realm but still exists. The core of Buddhist cultivation derives from the Seven Flower Kings.”

“What kind of beings are the Seven Flower Kings?”

She explained slowly.

“As the name suggests, they are mythical beings composed of various myths and legends. They are trial-givers and enlightenment-bringers to the secular world. They aren’t real gods but conceptual beings personified.”

“They don’t exist?”

“Correct. They are mere concepts. As proof, no ritual can be offered to them. Thus, Buddhist cultivation incorporates the concept of the Seven Flower Kings into its practices, but the training itself borrows from Daoist cultivation.”

‘They don’t exist?’ Then what did I feel? When I faced the masters of heavenly punishment and the underworld, I felt their presence as real gods. 

“Regardless, their names are as follows. The Golden Body Heavenly King, symbolizing the moment. The Red Jewel Extinction Heavenly King, symbolizing circulation. The Glass Guardian Heavenly King, symbolizing protection. The Silver Basket Heavenly King, symbolizing infinity. The Clam Shell Broad Cold Heavenly King, symbolizing cohesion. The Agate Hatred Heavenly King, symbolizing suffering. The Obsidian Demon Heavenly King, symbolizing filth. These seven are the Seven Flower Kings, personified concepts. And…”

She looked at her body and spoke.

“If you wish to discuss more, there is a temple called Tae Nyeo-sa at the bottom of the Yun-do area below the Celestial Path. My main body is there. Visit me.”

With that, Tae Yeol-jeon’s projection dissipated. She had exhausted her energy sparring with me. 

I reflected on the duel.

‘Buddhist cultivation….’ It stirred my consciousness significantly. Perhaps, Buddhist cultivation could offer a solution to my mental anomaly. I decided to visit with Yeon.

Crack, crack, crack… 

Ku-gu-gu— 

The collapsed mountain range. From beneath, a massive black figure emerged. Black Dragon King Hyeon-eum turned his furious gaze towards the intruder who destroyed his East Division. His eyes fell upon the Peculiar Fortress.

Wooong! 

Seeing the fully operational Peculiar Fortress by the Puppet Lord, Hyeon-eum’s eyes narrowed. Then he shook his head. Staring at the Peculiar Fortress, he smirked. A confused voice echoed from the Peculiar Fortress.

Click! Flash! 

With a sound, six strange beams shot from the Peculiar Fortress into Hyeon-eum’s mouth. His head snapped back, and he was sent flying.
