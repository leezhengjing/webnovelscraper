君 is Not a Monarch (2)

Gurgle, gurgle...

Se Hyul murmured something from inside the Qinglin Armor. However, I just grinned.

"What are you saying? I can't hear you."

The lake water nullified most physical forces. That was the true nature of the Qinglin Armor. Se Hyul tried to escape by emitting his magical power. But as I infused more power into the Qinglin Armor, Se Hyul's entire body was crushed, and he could no longer resist.

'That's my body...'

Recalling that fact annoyed me, but I had no choice if I wanted to seal him.

Splash!

I realized that using the Qinglin Armor was gradually causing abnormalities in my body, so I released the Guiwang Transformation for now.

'It seems impossible to use the Qinglin Armor without a body that has flowing blood...'

Hiss—

Every time I controlled the Qinglin Armor, I felt an increasing thirst. I guessed it was some side effect of a mortal like me handling the Qinglin Armor.

'If the side effects of the Qinglin Armor worsen, who knows what will happen. I should seal Se Hyul as soon as possible.'

At that moment...

"Excuse me, sir. Did you capture that fiend?"

"Hmm?"

I glanced at the people cautiously approaching from the edge of the Bongyang Layer. They were celestial beings from the Hanryeong, Yeopta, and Yeonglin tribes, whom I had seen at the entrance.

"Yes, but what is it?"

"That fiend killed our comrades and took their relics!"

"Please allow us to retrieve our comrades' relics."

'Hmm, Se Hyul could certainly do that.'

I nodded and said, "Tell me what relics he took."

"Yes, first, if you search that fiend, you will find a red jade box."

"Alright, let's see..."

I tried to control the Qinglin Armor to retrieve the jade box, but I realized that Se Hyul's body was sealed tightly.

'Did he steal some important magical treasure?'

Otherwise, there was no reason for Se Hyul to cherish it so much.

"Sir, I will explain the sealing technique that fiend used as much as I know. If you reverse-engineer the technique, you should be able to retrieve it."

"Alright, explain."

A member of the Yeopta tribe approached me and displayed the flow of spiritual energy in the air.

"First, gather the Yin energy like this, then let the Taiji escape from the Yin based on the power of the Eight Trigrams..."

Buzz—

"Then rotate the energy counterclockwise once and make it bite its tail to form a circle. Compress that circle like this..."

Whirr—

A fiercely rotating flow of spiritual energy appeared above the Yeopta tribe member's hand.

"Like this..."

Boom—

Without mercy, I accelerated my thoughts with Ganghwan and struck the Yeopta tribe member's head with all my might.

Bang—

The Yeopta tribe member flew far away, but the ring of Yin energy he left behind flew towards me. As I reached out to deflect the ring of Yin energy, my body suddenly froze.

Buzz—

Four Yeonglin tribe cultivators simultaneously used their spiritual eyes to restrain me.

'These bastards...'

In the end, I couldn't avoid the ring created by the Yeopta tribe member and got hit.

Crunch!

An overwhelming coldness enveloped me. Since I had released the Guiwang Transformation, the coldness froze my body. If I transformed into the Guiwang form, which was strong against Yin energy, it would hinder my control of the Qinglin Armor.

Gritting my teeth in the mist of Yin energy, I began to accelerate my consciousness with the circuits of the Gwaegun and the Dengbongjo.

At that moment...

Stab!

"...Huh?"

I let out a hollow laugh as I saw the person who suddenly appeared and stabbed me in the back through the mist of coldness.

"Why are you here...?"

It was a member of the Heuklin Eoryeongmun's Cheonin Division. The ones who had sealed me earlier had appeared. They had all received the Hanryeong tribe's spells, perfectly hiding their presence, thoughts, and spiritual energy in the coldness to ambush me.

I laughed hollowly as I looked at them.

"Ah, I see. I understand now..."

Bulge, bulge!

The Heuklin Eoryeongmun's Cheonin Division member, with a 'kind' smile, swelled up and exploded while still stabbing me in the back.

Flash!

Rumble!

Splash!

"Ugh...!"

I coughed up a handful of blood and retreated. The self-destruction of a Heuklin Eoryeongmun's Cheonin Division member, who could exhibit the power of the early Sashukgi stage, was no joke. I could recover using the Daemaksa Haeseong, but it would take some time.

Wiping the blood, I laughed hollowly as I looked at the Yeopta, Hanryeong, Yeonglin, and Heuklin Eoryeongmun cultivators in front of me. They all wore the same gentle, kind expressions.

"Why, Se Do, didn't you say you wanted a proper fight?"

"...You guys, no... you."

I growled, glaring at 'Se Hyul.'

"Who is the real body?"

They all smiled kindly and spoke simultaneously.

"I am."

"I am."

"I am."

"I am the real body."

"I am the real body."

"I am the real body."

And then, the combined attack of the 'Se Hyuls' began. The Se Hyul in the Hanryeong tribe cultivator's body smiled and emitted cold energy. Simultaneously, the Yeopta tribe cultivators received the cold energy, precisely manipulating and amplifying its power before launching it at me. The Heuklin Eoryeongmun cultivators, supported by the Hanryeong tribe cultivators, hid in the coldness, raising their blood energy and targeting me in close combat. The Yeonglin tribe cultivators restricted my movements with their unique spiritual eye abilities from the rear, casting illusions or predicting my movements and spells.

"The Sangsangwonyeong technique of the Heuklin Eoryeongmun is truly convenient. Storing power externally and calling it whenever needed is so attractive. It maximizes the harmony of the Heaven and Earth tribes' power, allowing one to leap a realm."

Se Hyul laughed as he poured attacks on me.

"And thanks to you, Se Do, I can also use the power of the Gwaegun Noya, truly..."

Buzz!

The circuits of the Gwaegun were engraved on the upper body of the Heuklin Eoryeongmun cultivator, who was at the early Sashukgi stage. Despite the considerable pain it must have caused, the Heuklin Eoryeongmun cultivator possessed by Se Hyul didn't even blink. In an instant, his power surged to the late Sashukgi stage.

"I must express my gratitude like this."

"Ugh..."

I gritted my teeth, emitting curses from my entire body. However, I was gradually being pushed back.

'Qinglin Armor! The Qinglin Armor is draining my mental strength...!'

Crack—

Every time I focused on keeping the seal on my main body within the Qinglin Armor intact, the thirst grew stronger. But at the same time, the Se Hyuls, who were pouring out cold energy like mad to freeze me to death, made me feel like I was going insane from the cold.

'If I don't use the Guiwang Transformation, my body will eventually freeze from the cold...!'

But using the Guiwang Transformation would make it difficult to control the Qinglin Armor. It was a dilemma either way.

At that moment...

Stab!

Piercing through the blue coldness, Se Hyul, in the Hanryeong tribe cultivator's body, grabbed my shoulder from behind.

"Hehe, Se Do. I finally caught you."

Bulge, bulge...!

The Hanryeong tribe cultivator's body squirmed. I could feel the immense cold energy amplifying within him.

'No, this can't be...!'

Unable to hold back any longer, I transformed into the Guiwang form while Se Hyul held my shoulder.

Crunch!

Eighteen heads rose majestically. Simultaneously, the cold energy was pleasantly absorbed into my transformed body. I gritted my teeth, my eyes glowing with demonic energy.

Swoosh—

In the end, I failed to control the Qinglin Armor. Se Hyul, who had been sealed inside, smiled as he was released.

"Well then, shall we start over properly?"

I had no idea how he did it.

'Did he parasitize using something like a Gwigogo?'

I gathered demonic energy, looking at the other cultivators possessed by Se Hyul. Now that I had used the Guiwang Transformation, I no longer had to worry about being overpowered by him.

"Well, it's something similar."

For some reason, I felt that statement was a lie. It might be better to interpret everything he said in reverse.

'I see. Killing Se Hyul doesn't mean he will parasitize.'

He must be using some other method to attempt parasitism.

"Well then, shall we properly use the body Se Do has painstakingly nurtured?"

Buzz—

The circuits of the Gwaegun glowed on the main body's back, and eight pairs of wings sprouted. The fusion of Heaven, Earth, and Gwae energies produced the power of the Sashukgi level. It seemed he had exhausted all the energy he had absorbed from killing Gyo Yeom and Nok Ju earlier.

However, I felt my heart tighten. I hurriedly looked at my waist. The Jeomuldo that had been at my waist was now in Se Hyul's hand.

'Did the Hanryeong tribe member take it when he self-destructed? How? Can he move that stealthily? Wait, could it be...'

I shouted at him, assuming the worst.

"Ah, was the name of this technique that cuts consciousness Wolsoogungmulok? It wasn't difficult. Since I can use the Gimyoseongshimjeon, I just had to use it to sharpen and cut consciousness."

I felt my insides churn. It wasn't just that Wolsoogungmulok had fallen into Se Hyul's hands. It was the feeling that the realm of martial arts I had developed and worked hard on was being invaded by that filthy bastard.

"Let's see, I put it here..."

He nonchalantly rummaged through my Jeomuldo and took out the Haerangwa.

"Ah, found it. Well then, I'll enjoy this."

Crunch, crunch...

He began to eat the Haerangwa with my main body. At the same time, his energy began to surge.

Crack!

"To evolve Changhoja's technique into a Yosugong technique, Se Do, you are truly remarkable. A Yosugong technique perfectly suited for the human race... I'm sorry, but I will make some modifications."

Flash!

At that moment, the energy from the main body exploded, and his realm rose. From the Cheonin Division member, he became a Sashukgi!

Rumble!

Dark clouds began to gather in the sky above the Bongyang Layer. The heavenly tribulation was beginning.

'Why is he attempting to ascend in front of me?'

I couldn't understand Se Hyul at all. Why was he doing such a thing in front of me? If I ambushed him, he would likely fail to overcome the heavenly tribulation and die or fall into demonic possession.

'Is he that confident?'

Buzz—

I drew the demonic sword created with the Eumhong Gwijumun and raised the curse. Just as I was about to throw the demonic sword filled with the pain of seeing the [Name] of the true sage and the pain of the high-level extraction and pain potion at Se Hyul...

Clang!

Suddenly, my left hand grabbed my right hand, which was about to throw the demonic sword. And then, the faces on my shoulders seemed to crackle, and six of the eighteen faces spoke in a chilling voice.

I listened to their voices in silence.

Rumble, rumble!

The twin-colored heavenly tribulation fell on the main body's body, and I silently glowed with demonic energy. If killing him didn't mean parasitism, it should be even harder to parasitize. I also had to push the Heuklin Eoryeongmun members for a long time to attach the Gwigogo to them, and even after attaching the Gwigogo, I couldn't immediately take over their minds. Even though I used Wolsoogungmulok to attach the Gwigogo, it was easy for Wolsoogungmulok users to recognize each other. In other words, even if Se Hyul used a technique similar to Wolsoogungmulok to attempt parasitism on me, it didn't make sense that it was so hard to detect.

Swoosh!

After releasing the Guiwang Transformation, I saw that they were about to attack me again, so I pulled the Qinglin Armor around my body. The Qinglin Armor compressed to my body size, surrounding me with transparent water. Their attacks had no effect on me, but I had to remain still due to Se Hyul's attempts to take control of my body from within.

"I'd rather become General Seo of the Gwaegun than give my body to a scoundrel like you."

"Hmm... On second thought, maybe not, but anyway, I won't let you take it."

Crack...

The main body's heavenly tribulation ended. At the same time, the main body, now more like a Yosugong technique user of the Haeryong tribe, was Se Hyul. He had fully reached the Sashukgi stage.

Buzz—

I felt the Heuklin Eoryeongmun cultivators using the Sangsangwonyeong technique to connect the outer space with the Bongyang Layer.

"Longevity, wealth, and virtue."

Flash!

The three pillars of the Sangsangwonyeong technique, which he had shown earlier, flew from the outer space to this side. He must have hidden the pillars somewhere and was now retrieving them.

Buzz, buzz, buzz!

The three pillars naturally entered Se Hyul's body. In an instant, he exuded the energy of the Sashukgi Daeweonman stage. When the energy of General Seo, who was at the Sashukgi stage, overlapped with his body, an enormous amplification of power occurred.

'Fusion technique...!'

Now he had the clear power of a Yowang-level fusion technique. Se Hyul smiled and approached me, who was wrapped in the Qinglin Armor.

"Se Do, may I borrow your body for a moment?"

He spread his arms as if proposing, standing five jang away from me.

"I won't keep your body forever. Just for a moment, a very brief moment from your perspective of living for eternity. Can't you even allow that?"

"I can't trust your words."

"I see... That's unfortunate."

Se Hyul turned his back without changing his expression.

"Then I have no choice but to take your body by force."

Buzz—

At that moment, an overwhelming force of consciousness struck my mind.

'This, this is...?'

Brainwashing. It was powerful brainwashing. It was so painful and terrifying that I couldn't imagine enduring this suggestion and brainwashing.

'What the hell is this...!'

It wasn't just about breaking the opponent's will. It was more like dismantling the existence of 'me.'

'Ah... damn it...'

My consciousness grew blurry. I thought that was the end of it.

—If you were born from me, show some will.

Buzz—

Flash!

"Ugh!"

I opened my eyes wide with a splitting headache. At the same time, I saw Se Hyul, who had been turning his back, kneeling with his head in his hands.

Buzz—

For a moment, I saw an illusion of a white slash passing quickly through Se Hyul's head. And for the first time, Se Hyul screamed.

"Ugh... Se Do...!"

He screamed but didn't lose his smile as he looked ahead. I also looked in the direction of his gaze. There stood 'me' in white clothes.

'Ah...'

I could feel it. The presence in front of me was...

"How have you been, Se Rip?"

Seo Eunhyun. My main body.

Buzz—

He raised one hand. In his hand was a sword glowing in all colors. It was so bright it was almost blinding. The sword seemed to embody all the light of the world.

"Hehe, Se Do. How did you do it? I don't understand. As expected of Se Do."

He smiled, looking at the main body. The main body swung the sword expressionlessly. It was a sword of light that stood out so much. However, strangely, Se Hyul couldn't perceive the sword of light.

Buzz!

Slash!

The slash of light cut through Se Hyul's shoulder.

"Hehe, an attack that can't be perceived or felt at all... I think I understand."

At those words, the main body smiled and looked at me.

"Listen carefully, Se Rip. What he means is 'How did you do that!'"

"..."

Step, step...

The main body approached me and swung the sword of light at my head. The sword of light passed through my head, and at the same time, I felt Se Hyul's voice, which had been whispering inside me, being swept away.

"He can't see this light. It's only visible to us."

"Main body... you..."

"Se Rip."

He looked at me and said.

"I am not the main body."

"What?"

"I am Seo Eunhyun."

* * *

I smiled at Se Rip, who had a bewildered expression. Holding the newly born Muheongum, I turned my back on him and looked at Se Hyul.

"Let's fight together, Se Rip. We need to drive out that monster here and reclaim the Museok Yurigum."

While Se Hyul was stealing my techniques like Wolsoogungmulok from within me, I had stolen his true identity. He was a terrifying, absurd monster. To reclaim my body, I needed Se Rip's help.

Se Rip stood beside me.

"I don't understand, but anyway..."

He smiled and gathered his demonic energy. Wearing black and white clothes, we simultaneously charged at Se Hyul.
