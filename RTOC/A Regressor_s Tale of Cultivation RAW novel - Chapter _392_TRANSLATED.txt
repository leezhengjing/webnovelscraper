**Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 392: Drinking (2)**

I gazed at the scenery beyond the mirror of inspection as if entranced. 

"This, this is…."

Buzz—

As I reached out beyond the mirror, my consciousness seemed to be drawn towards the altar of the Fengyang Layer within the realm of the True Dragon Immortal. 

Crackle—

After a while, I opened my eyes and realized that I had awakened on the altar of the Fengyang Layer within the realm of the True Dragon Immortal, in the form of a "dream body."

"...Ha, hahaha!"

I let out a hollow laugh at the unexpected situation. Without hesitation, I struck the air with a Zuo Taluo attack, attempting to form a clone.

Buzz—

Crack!

No, to be precise, I tried to form one. However, due to the strange power within the realm, the clone shattered as it was being created.

"It seems there are some inherent restrictions in this otherworldly realm."

If that was the case, there was no choice. I reached out into the air, attempting to exert gravitational force.

Buzz—

However, the gravitational force and other abilities were also not properly manifested with the dream body.

"My power has weakened to about one ten-thousandth."

Of course, even at this level, it was equivalent to the power of a Qi Condensation cultivator, but that was all. 

After pondering for a moment, I recalled the characteristics of the dream body. Using the power of Qi Condensation, I gathered the surrounding water vapor to create water, then froze it to form an ice puppet. 

I then overlapped my dream body with the ice puppet.

Crackle—

It was possession. 

In the state of possessing the ice puppet, I tried to exert my power.

"It's a bit easier to use my strength."

The dream body was essentially a consciousness temporarily refined with the traits of a Ghost King. The dream body existed only on the outskirts of the Ghost Realm, so to exert power in reality, it was best to possess an entity in the current world.

Creak—

In the state of borrowing the ice puppet's body, I exerted gravitational force.

"It worked, the space is warping!"

Now, using the ice puppet's body as a coordinate, I just needed to create gravitational force between the realm of the True Dragon Immortal and the deep sea of the High Power Realm to escape! 

Just as I thought that—

Crack—

"...."

The puppet's body shattered in an instant. It seemed that an ice fragment couldn't withstand my power for long.

"This is a bit troublesome."

Clicking my tongue, I tried various methods like growing trees with wood-based techniques or creating clay dolls with earth-based techniques. However, all attempts ended the same way.

"Damn it, my main body's power has grown too strong, causing puppets to shatter when I exert gravitational force."

There was only one solution.

"I need to create a General."

However, there was a problem. In this realm, there were surprisingly no suitable materials. Everything that could be considered a material had been burned to ashes in the ever-burning realm. There were stone structures that didn't burn easily, but even if I made a puppet out of them, it would only be as strong as a Yuan Ying cultivator.

"Can a Yuan Ying puppet withstand the space between the High Power Realm and this realm and allow us to escape?"

No matter how much I thought about it, it seemed impossible. 

However, as I pondered, an idea came to mind.

"...In about a hundred years, they will come."

In about a hundred years, it would be the 500th year since my return. Around that time, two cultivators from the Celestial Race and one from the Earth Race would enter this realm.

"Zhangmu Clan, Tianyi Clan, and... the Blood Sect's Jiaoyan."

Thinking of them, my eyes sparkled.

"I'll take over their bodies!"

By possessing one of them, I could use proper gravitational force to use this realm as a coordinate and pull the Guanghan Realm back to the High Power Realm.

I recalled Jiaoyan, who had been killed by Seohul in my previous life.

"Even if it's not Seohul, Jiaoyan would have been killed by the two from the Zhangmu and Tianyi Clans if it weren't for me."

Jiaoyan's actions to obtain the Celestial Lotus to cure his wife's illness had left a strong impression on me.

"I hope he can survive in this life."

I made my decision.

"When the exploration team arrives in a hundred years, I'll help Jiaoyan obtain the Celestial Lotus he desires and, with his help, return to the Guanghan Realm...!"

Clenching my fist with my main body, I laughed. I thought there was no hope. But now, hope was in sight!

"I need to gather the treasures within this realm before the exploration team arrives."

Jiaoyan wouldn't trust a stranger like me easily. To gain his help, it would be ideal to gather the treasures within this realm and offer them to him in exchange.

A contract requires something of value to be possible.

"Don't pick the Celestial Lotus prematurely."

"Thank you for the advice."

I heard that the Celestial Lotus would be absorbed immediately upon contact with a dream body. In other words, if I picked it prematurely to gather treasures, it would be absorbed by my dream body, making it impossible to offer it to Jiaoyan in a deal.

Nodding, I looked around the realm. Only I was inside this realm. In other words, all the treasures within this realm were mine alone!

Smiling, I turned my consciousness back to my main body. I saw hope. Now, there was a possibility of returning to the Guanghan Realm within decades. I returned with a satisfied heart and shared the good news with everyone.

* * *

"Very good! So now we just have to wait?"

"Unless something particularly obstructs us... yes."

In the meeting room, I spoke with a bitter smile to Yeonwi.

"But as I mentioned before, it's true that some misfortune is surrounding us."

I looked up at the sky. Even if Jiaoyan helped us, the gravitational force of the misfortune still clung to me, even though we were trapped in the deep sea. The misfortune was coiling around the surroundings of Bongraedo.

As I spoke seriously, Yeonwi's face also hardened, and she asked,

"...So the misfortune is visible even in the High Power Realm... it wasn't a joke?"

"I always speak the truth."

"Ancestor, you need to learn to trust your juniors a bit more."

Jeon Myunghun chuckled, and Yeonwi clicked her tongue and shook her head.

"I don't believe anything unless I see it myself. I've never heard of such a thing being possible. Unless it's a Seongban who can extend their consciousness or vision beyond the Middle Realm... such a thing is absolutely impossible."

"Hmm... was it possible for the Golden Thunder Sect to turn to ashes overnight?"

"..."

At Jeon Myunghun's gloomy words, Yeonwi couldn't respond and looked depressed.

"Well... I understand. So, some high-ranking entity has marked you. And because of the gravitational force of that misfortune, everyone here, including the Muguk Cult, is currently trapped in Bongraedo?"

"That's correct."

Yeonwi seemed to ponder for a moment before speaking.

"Then you should leave Bongraedo."

"...!"

"What nonsense...!"

Her words caused an uproar in the meeting room.

"Yeonwi, if you leave Bongraedo now, you'll become a lost soul in the deep sea!"

"I know that. But after receiving the coordinates from those cultivators entering the otherworldly realm, it would be best for Seoeunhyun to stay in the High Power Realm while we escape."

At her words, Kim Yeon, Oh Hyunseok, Kim Younghoon, and even Jeon Myunghun showed fierce expressions. However, Yeonwi ignored them and growled at everyone.

"Did I say something wrong? Seoeunhyun is the leader and the one responsible for this group. If the leader is the problem and the group is trapped, the one who should take responsibility must do so. Just as I took the order of the Seongsa to destroy the Golden Thunder Sect in the Middle Realm 40,000 years ago to save the main sect in the Lower Realm, even if it meant being branded a monster!"

Bang!

Yeonwi's eyes turned red with blood as she slammed the table.

"If you bear the title of the group's elder and leader, you must do so!"

Rumble—

Her words caused a chilling atmosphere to spread in the meeting room. Jeon Myunghun's eyes twitched as he spoke.

"...If that's the case, then I, who am in the Fusion Stage, should stay instead of Seoeunhyun, who hasn't even reached the Fusion Stage."

Yeonwi's eyes widened.

"What nonsense! Didn't you hear Seoeunhyun say that only he is entangled with the misfortune?"

"By using my Red Thunder Heavenly Tribulation and Seoeunhyun's Destruction Tribulation, it might be possible to transfer the misfortune to me through a sacrificial ritual. After all... the Red Thunder Heavenly Tribulation and Destruction Tribulation are techniques based on someone's sacrifice, so it's not impossible."

"Don't talk nonsense! You are the greatest elder of the current Golden Thunder Sect! Seoeunhyun and I were stripped of our Kim surname by the Ancestor's decree, making us outsiders in reality! But you are still Kim Myunghun! If you stay here, what will happen to the Golden Thunder Sect in the Lower Realm?"

However, after speaking, Yeonwi seemed startled and looked around. The killing intent had grown stronger.

Rumble—

At the center of the Guangyin Realm, the entire Muguk Cult was shaking due to the killing intent of those present. Jeon Myunghun spoke softly.

"...Ancestor, you say that I, who was born with the Celestial Golden Thunder Body and am Kim Myunghun, should not stay, but Seoeunhyun, who is an outsider, should stay. Seoeunhyun has been a companion who has contributed to the survival of the Golden Thunder Sect. Thanks to the Muguk Cult established by Seoeunhyun, we were able to save the disciples of the Golden Thunder Sect in the Ghost Realm!"

At Jeon Myunghun's outburst, Yeonwi's pupils seemed to waver. However, she gritted her teeth and shouted back at Jeon Myunghun.

"What nonsense are you talking about! Have you all forgotten the essence, distracted by playing cult leader and cult games? This cult is just a means to build the Five Blessings! You are a disciple of the Golden Thunder Sect! Even if Seoeunhyun and I were expelled, we should still have a sense of belonging to the Golden Thunder Sect! What is this cult leader nonsense!"

"Why don't you trust Seoeunhyun! Have you forgotten his efforts to save the Golden Thunder Sect with the seniors! In the end, Seoeunhyun was right! Even in the High Power Realm, I heard about the senior's actions. Why can't you trust people and only betray them! We are the Golden Thunder Sect, not the Betrayal Thunder Sect!!!"

At Jeon Myunghun's heated words, Yeonwi seemed momentarily dazed. Her voice trembled as she spoke.

"...Yes! It's me and Seoeunhyun! And sealing the Heavenly Thunder Tribulation was my idea too! Not Seoeunhyun's! Why can't I trust him? Do you want to know the honest truth?"

Yeonwi's voice was trembling. Consumed by emotions from her argument with Jeon Myunghun, she gritted her teeth and shouted.

"How can I trust him!!! You, with the Celestial Golden Thunder Body, naturally advance in cultivation, but what about him! He ascended from the mortal realm with an ordinary body and reached the Five Blessings in less than 500 years with a common Five Elements Spiritual Root!? Does that make sense to you?"

"Why not! Talent..."

"Such talent is only possible with the Celestial Golden Thunder Body or the Ghost Dao Yin Fire Spiritual Root! It's impossible without such mythical qualities! He's not even a unique physique like the Oga, nor does he have exceptional intelligence! Yet he mastered the Twin Hands of Heaven and Earth, the Profound Dao Techniques, and even the Taishan Yulje Technique in less than 500 years! Even the Black Dragon King Hyun Eum, who advanced at a similar pace, did so with the support of the Dragon Clan and countless opportunities. But what about him! I've heard he resisted the temptation of the unsealed Heavenly Thunder Tribulation with a clear mind. Do you think that's possible? The power of that abomination is something no mortal mind can withstand. Yet he remains unscathed under the power of a transcendent being? There's only one possible explanation. He's not human!"

Yeonwi pointed at me and shouted.

"He's not a Celestial Golden Thunder Body, yet he mastered thunder techniques faster than Jeon Myunghun. He's not a Ghost Dao Yin Fire Spiritual Root, yet he has an extraordinary talent for Ghost Dao techniques. He mastered all Five Elements techniques, beast techniques, and even the Profound Dao techniques. He has a knack for consciousness techniques and even resisted the power of the Heavenly Thunder Tribulation with a clear mind. If all this is possible, he must be a transcendent being disguised as a human!"

At Yeonwi's words, the meeting room fell silent. She looked at me with a gloomy gaze and spoke to Jeon Myunghun.

"...You asked why I betray. If I don't betray, I could be betrayed. Always! If I can't determine whether he's human or a monster, it wouldn't be surprising if he reveals himself as a transcendent being and kills us all one day. So, isn't it reasonable to separate him from us now?"

"..."

"...Life never goes as you wish... never. This world is filled with the utmost evil. Dreaming or hoping for blessings is a luxury in itself. You should never hope for anything. Always prepare for the worst and be ready to survive."

She was spewing harsh words aimed at me, but ironically, I was the only one who truly empathized with her words. The loyal followers who genuinely served me seemed ready to tear Yeonwi apart, and none of my fellow cult leaders looked at her kindly.

With a bitter smile, I spoke.

"...So why did you say all this in front of me? If I were a transcendent being, it would be nothing to drag your soul and torture it for a thousand years."

Yeonwi flinched but didn't respond to my words.

"...Jeon Myunghun. Send the military advisor's consciousness back to the Lower Realm."

"Understood."

Jeon Myunghun approached Yeonwi, knocked her unconscious, and sent her consciousness back to the Lower Realm. After Yeonwi fainted, Yeon Jin, who woke up, seemed confused by the tense atmosphere and trembled.

I smiled gently and spoke.

"Don't hate her too much. She was just worried about all of us in her own way...."

Yeonwi always pretended to be evil, but her intentions were good. 

'It seems the dream she had in Bongraedo influenced her emotions.'

Jeon Myunghun and Yeonwi didn't need to push each other so hard. But it seemed the dream in Bongraedo was the problem.

"Let's adjourn today's meeting. We have hope of leaving the High Power Realm in a hundred years, so let everyone know."

I adjourned the meeting and stood up.

* * *

Step, step....

After leaving the meeting room, I walked towards the salt mountain of Bongraedo. The illusionary formation had disappeared, leaving Bongraedo desolate. In the illusion, Bongraedo flourished around the salt mountain, but outside the illusion, only hinges were visible around the salt mountain.

Splash!

I climbed to the top of the salt mountain, where the palace of the Salt King once stood, and sat down, looking at the top of Bongraedo. The misfortune that surrounded me did not enter Bongraedo. Of course, it would have a terrifying effect when we left, but at least it couldn't enter here.

"In Bongraedo, all contracts and oaths are nullified."

It was the explanation of Yukrin and Yukyo. Perhaps the misfortune was also a kind of contract or oath. And despite the misfortune still being entangled with me, I told everyone there was hope of leaving because of Bongraedo.

The power of Bongraedo blocking the misfortune meant that if I could find that power, I could avoid the misfortune and return to the Guanghan Realm.

"And the source of that power is... most likely this salt mountain."

Everyone thought the source of the formation was the palace of the Salt King. After all, the salt mountain was just a large chunk of rock salt. But the formation of Bongraedo still worked. Although the illusionary formation was broken when the palace and the salt mountain separated, some power blocking the contracts, oaths, and misfortune remained.

In other words,

"If I refine the power of this salt mountain, there's a high chance we can all leave."

The atmosphere was too tense today, so I adjourned the meeting. I planned to inform Yeonwi of this fact after she cooled down and returned.

Buzz—

Sitting on the top of the salt mountain, I closed my eyes and began to use the techniques I had obtained from Yukrin, the Salt Sea Ghost Jade from the realm of the True Dragon Immortal, and the Taishan Yulje Technique.

Why did Yeonwi, despite the dream in Bongraedo and Jeon Myunghun's influence, reveal uncomfortable truths in front of me, who could be a transcendent being?

It was simple. Despite saying that one should never hope for anything in this world, she also hoped. She hoped that I, who had been with her for a long time, was truly human.

Crackle—

White particles began to gather and shine around me. As I recited the Taishan Yulje Technique and its reverse incantation, the entire salt mountain began to glow.

The remaining time was a hundred years. Within that time, I would refine the power of the salt mountain and break through the misfortune to return to the Guanghan Realm.

**Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 224: Drinking (3)**

Splash!

At the edge of the Weizheng Sea, someone pierced through the wall of the sky and entered the Weizheng Sea. It was a golden Peng bird. From within the Peng bird, Seoeunhyun and Kim Younghoon emerged.

Splash, splash!

Seoeunhyun shook off his body after escaping the sea through the Zuo Taluo clone he had left in the Yinglong Sea with Kim Younghoon. The clone's body was covered in sticky mucus from being momentarily trapped in a dimension fragment filled with mucus while crossing the sea.

"Ugh, ugh!"

Seoeunhyun and Kim Younghoon spat out the mucus and looked around before nodding at each other.

Flash!

Following Kim Younghoon, he flew for a while and landed on an island in the sea. It was the island where the Mug
