Avenger (2)

How long had they waited in front of the main gate of the Heukrin Eoryeongmun? When the number of gathered curse practitioners exceeded ten thousand, the main gate of the Heukrin Eoryeongmun opened with a loud rumble. Inside the open gate, a boy dressed in a black long robe was waiting for us in a neat appearance.

"Thank you all for gathering in response to our sect's mission request. As some of you may already know, our sect has previously sought specialized personnel for unique tasks like this several times."

The boy continued his explanation.

"In truth, what we are looking for in the Heukrin Eoryeongmun are about ten top-tier curse practitioners with truly exceptional skills. In other words... unfortunately, the vast majority of those gathered here will have to return. As some of you may already know."

Voices of discontent were heard from various places.

"Hey, what do you mean by that!?"

"Don't talk nonsense!"

"I gave up a better mission to come here!"

I crossed my arms and watched how things unfolded with indifferent eyes. The boy smiled slightly, ignoring the noisy outcries of the curse practitioners, and raised one finger.

"As some of you may already know... Anyway, from now on, we will start testing to see if you meet the level of curse practitioners we require."

At the same time, a gigantic monster appeared behind the boy.

'...!'

The monster possessed powerful demonic energy (妖力) and at the same time, eerie corpse energy (屍氣). I felt a strong sense of familiarity from the monster.

"This creature's name is Bi (泌). As some of you may know, it is a fusion of fragments of corpses from the Void and the corpse of a Guanghan Realm demon. They are extremely ferocious and difficult to kill. Moreover, we have specially modified them to absorb curses and further enhance their physical strength."

The boy said this and flew into the air.

Boom!

The monster named Bi placed its upper body on the ground. The ground shook, and a sense of crisis exploded.

"From now on, only those who can pass through the main gate of the Heukrin Eoryeongmun while avoiding Bi will be considered for further discussion. I wish you all the best of luck."

The boy soon disappeared inside the main gate, and Bi moved to completely block the main gate with its massive body.

"Damn it! Isn't this too much for a large sect? I heard they would give us a mission just for coming!"

"This is too much. Do you know how much it cost just to get here?"

"Spit, live well!"

About a hundred curse practitioners with ambiguous skills left the scene in a rush. Those who remained were somewhat confident in their curse abilities.

'They all seem ambiguous.'

I clicked my tongue and looked around. They all seemed confident, but it appeared that more of them had stayed behind with false hopes due to their shallow understanding of curses. Such individuals would also be filtered out in this test.

'There's no reason to just watch.'

I walked silently towards Bi. As I approached the main gate, Bi bared its teeth and growled.

'Corpses (尸)...'

The monsters I had seen in the Void. It seemed these monsters were called corpses (尸). Bi raised its front paw to strike at me. I put my hands behind my back and fell into thought, not paying attention.

Boom!

Its front paw came crashing down. But in the next moment, the black curse patterns surrounding my body melted its front paw entirely. The monster screamed and twisted its body, while I calmly melted Bi's body and continued forward. At the same time, I analyzed the energy I felt from the monster.

'It certainly resembles the energy from the Void.'

I asked Biyul, "Biyul, do you know what corpses (尸) are?"

"Recite it."

Biyul explained.

"Ho..."

The monsters from the Void. It was new information that corpses were actually the remnants left behind when they ascended to immortality.

'From the fusion stage, a small world forms within the body, and at the enlightenment stage, even the remnants become as powerful as a small world...'

"...If they are the remnants left behind when ascending to immortality..."

The Tao of Earth and the Tao of this world were distinctly different. However, there were many similarities, and ascending to immortality was one of them.

"So, the remnants of those who have cultivated their physical bodies to the enlightenment stage, huh?"

"Ho..."

Listening to the explanation about corpses, I finally succeeded in piercing through Bi's body and reaching the other side.

Swoosh!

Even though I had walked quite slowly, it seemed I was the first to arrive. Behind me, curse practitioners were shouting and trying to pierce through Bi's body with various curses, but it seemed futile. The path I had pierced through was wriggling and regenerating rapidly.

"Hello, sir. Please state your name and affiliated sect."

The boy who had summoned Bi approached me with a smiling face and asked.

"Seorip. Affiliated with Heuksaek Guigol Gok."

"Understood."

The boy recorded my name and moved on to ask the names and affiliations of the curse practitioners who followed.

'Hmm, that boy...'

I looked at the boy with interest.

'A practitioner of the Heaven and Earth Dual Cultivation.'

Inside his small frame, I could feel the powerful life force of the demon race and the power of the celestial race. Strangely, the boy's power from the celestial and demon races was concealing each other, making it difficult to read his true level. With my experience of obtaining the Three-Tai Chi, I immediately recognized that the boy was at the Great Circle of the Origin Energy stage. However, those who had only mastered one of the celestial or demon race's techniques would not be able to understand the boy's true level.

How long had I been observing the boy? Three thousand curse practitioners gathered in the plaza beyond the main gate of the Heukrin Eoryeongmun after piercing through Bi. The boy waited for a moment, then spoke after all the presences beyond Bi had disappeared.

"It seems the others have given up. Very well. As some of you may know, those who have passed through the main gate will receive a small reward, so please keep that in mind. However, to receive the main mission, we will need to filter out more people through several tests, so please understand."

Then, tests to examine the curses of the gathered curse practitioners followed one after another. I broke through each test first and observed my surroundings.

'The curses used in the tests are flowing somewhere...'

It seemed the Heukrin Eoryeongmun was accumulating the curses of the curse practitioners somewhere.

'If they condense all these curses, a terrifying curse will be born...'

It was like the poison of Gu. Gathering and gathering curses to create an extremely vicious curse.

'What are they planning to do with such a curse?'

As I pondered this, how much time had passed? Eventually, only ten people remained, and everyone else was eliminated.

"Then, three curse practitioners from Heuksaek Guigol Gok, four curse practitioners from the former Eumhong Gwisimon, one curse practitioner from Bangryangmun, one curse practitioner from Mangguimun, and one curse practitioner from Sansu. A total of ten people have gathered. As some of you may know, we at Heukrin Eoryeongmun value capable individuals. Therefore, even if this mission fails, we wish to establish a good relationship with those gathered here and will provide an advance payment."

The boy handed each of us a black jade token.

"Ho, ho...! To give us this much reward in addition to the promised merit points...!"

"As expected of Heukrin Eoryeongmun..."

I was also impressed by the generosity of Heukrin Eoryeongmun.

'I knew they earned enormous commissions by mediating trade between the human and demon races, but... this is an enormous amount...'

I checked the spirit stones contained in the black jade token and clicked my tongue. Even I, who had little interest in wealth, was stunned by the amount.

"Hmm, then please explain the mission."

A celestial curse practitioner from Heuksaek Guigol Gok, who had come with me, cleared his throat and spoke.

"Yes, I will explain. First, as some of you may have noticed... we are actually gathering the curses of curse practitioners. We are collecting curses like a Gu poison jar to create a vicious curse. Currently, we are strengthening and amplifying the curse through the sect's formation."

A sinister man, who appeared to be a curse practitioner from Eumhong Gwisimon, licked his lips and spoke.

"Since Heukrin Eoryeongmun lacks curse practitioners... you want us to handle that curse?"

"That's correct. We need your help to amplify and strengthen the curse. After that, you will launch the curse towards the coordinates we provide."

"Well, if it's just that, it's easy. Handling such a powerful curse will also be beneficial for us, so it's a good thing for us too... I hope the task takes as long as possible."

The curse practitioner from Eumhong Gwisimon stroked his chin and nodded in satisfaction. At that moment, one of the celestial curse practitioners from Heuksaek Guigol Gok looked at the remnants of Eumhong Gwisimon and sneered.

"Indeed. It should take as long as possible. We are staying quiet now because of Heukrin Eoryeongmun's face, but as soon as the mission is over, you will be escorted to us."

The remnants of Eumhong Gwisimon laughed at the words of the Heuksaek Guigol Gok practitioners.

"Fools. This is a curse doll made from a Jiangshi. Catching a curse doll a hundred times won't make it easy to eliminate us. Hehehe..."

"I don't know who you're talking to, but it's not us who are afraid of you. It's Seopmyeongham that we fear. Without Seopmyeongham, you're nothing..."

"Hehe, if you're so upset, why don't you bring a divine artifact? It's pathetic to make excuses when you lost your divine artifact with your own hands."

It seemed sparks were flying between the remnants of Eumhong Gwisimon and the elders of Heuksaek Guigol Gok. The boy from Heukrin Eoryeongmun approached and mediated.

"Everything is fine, but please save personal conversations for after the mission."

At those words, the two groups glared at each other for a moment before turning their gazes away.

"Then, the main mission will start tomorrow, so please rest in the accommodations we provide today."

The boy guided us to the accommodations of Heukrin Eoryeongmun. We were allowed to tour some non-essential areas of Heukrin Eoryeongmun. I became curious and decided to explore various parts of Heukrin Eoryeongmun.

"Heukrin Eoryeongmun is quite large..."

"Well, it is a sect with a long history."

The boy's clone, who had followed me as a guide, smiled slightly. The boy had created a clone using the technique of the Four-Phase Origin to guide us through the non-essential areas of Heukrin Eoryeongmun. While walking around Heukrin Eoryeongmun with him, I arrived at the outskirts of the sect. There, I discovered an enormous valley.

'Hmm?'

Interestingly, the valley was rich in heavenly and earthly energy, and it didn't seem too steep to build structures. Yet, there were no buildings or traces of humans in the valley. In front of the valley, the symbol of Heukrin Eoryeongmun, a dragon ascending to the heavens, was drawn.

"Why is that valley left empty? It seems rich in heavenly and earthly energy and suitable for building structures..."

The boy gave a bitter smile and explained.

"As some of you may already know, it is a legend... In fact, the original site of Heukrin Eoryeongmun was where that valley is now. It used to be a mountain range, not a valley."

"What happened?"

"It is related to the founding of the sect... The symbol of Heukrin Eoryeongmun is the 'Ascending Dragon.' However, in the early days of the sect, the symbol was different."

"A different symbol?"

"Yes. The symbol was a 'Black Snake biting its tail.' Since our founder was the Black Dragon King, we couldn't presumptuously use the dragon as our symbol. But it was also inappropriate to use a symbol unrelated to him, so the 'Black Snake,' meaning we follow the dragon, was chosen as the sect's symbol."

The boy continued his explanation.

"However, the problem arose after the Black Dragon King attended the founding ceremony. He saw the symbol of the 'Black Snake' and became furious, scolding us for choosing such an ominous and dreadful symbol."

'The Black Dragon King became furious?'

He was likely a remnant of a true immortal. In my past life, he had shown an attitude of having nothing to fear in the Middle Realm, and he had indeed demonstrated such an attitude. But what could make someone like him use the expression 'furious'?

"In the end, the Black Dragon King collapsed the mountain range where the symbol of the 'Black Snake' was engraved, creating the valley. He then created the symbol of the 'Ascending Dragon' himself and left. Since then, the 'Black Snake' has become a taboo along with the old site."

"Hmm... I see."

I finally understood the words of the snake clan technique merchant when I purchased the technique of the Hongbeom. He had said that the Heukrin Eoryeongmun considered the black snake ominous and always sold snake clan techniques at a discount. It seemed related to the Black Dragon King, Hyeon Eum.

'The Black Dragon King was furious when he saw the connection to the true immortal... So, the symbol of the black snake is also related to the true immortal?'

It seemed correct to think so for now.

'Perhaps it's not the true immortal... In the worst case, it might be related to a true god...'

I assumed the worst-case scenario and focused my consciousness on my main body.

* * *

"How is it, Hongbeom? Have you had any problems while learning the technique of the demonic beast recently?"

"What kind of problems are you referring to?"

Since Hongbeom had arrived and we were having a conversation, I asked him directly.

"For example... Do you feel the gaze of some entity, or do you suddenly feel like you're not yourself, or do you feel a 'call' or something growing inside you?"

Hongbeom laughed heartily at my words.

"Not at all. I have never felt any problems, master."

"Hmm, is that so?"

If Hongbeom didn't feel any problems, the likelihood of the black snake being related to a true god seemed to decrease.

'It seems more likely to be related to a true immortal than a true god.'

"Alright. Is there anything else that bothers you?"

"No, there isn't. However..."

"However?"

"Recently, I feel a bit stuck in my poison cultivation."

"Is there something you need?"

"I have already found what I need. I went to the underground information market and successfully found the location of the poison I need."

Seeing Hongbeom growing steadily on his own, I smiled with satisfaction and said.

"If you need spirit stones, just let me know. I'll give you as many as you need."

"I appreciate the offer, but it's fine. The master of the poison has given me a mission related to making a deadly poison. If I complete the mission, he will give me the poison I want. To make the poison he wants, I will need to go deep into the territory of the demon race."

Hongbeom looked at me cautiously and asked.

"Is it alright if I go to the territory of the demon race? If you don't allow it, I won't go."

"Why wouldn't I allow it? It's something that will help you grow, so go ahead."

"Thank you."

The fact that Hongbeom had saved me from the dream imposed by the master of Salt Mountain with his formless poison had left a deep impression on me. If he grew stronger, it would ultimately benefit me as well.

"By the way, what kind of poison does the demon race want from you?"

"It seems to be a type of mountain poison. The client wants a poison that can lower the level of a fusion stage grandmaster... but it will depend on the quality of the materials they provide."

"Ho, it seems they are planning something grand."

A poison that could affect a fusion stage grandmaster sounded terrifying. I encouraged Hongbeom and sent him off. Shortly after, Jeon Myeonghun entered the eastern hall.

"So, you have something to discuss?"

Jeon Myeonghun grinned and got straight to the point.

"I'm planning to go to the Netherworld. To go there, I will inevitably need the help of Heuksaek Guigol Gok."

"I can help, but it might take some time."

"No, it's fine. It might even be possible to go right now!"

"Hmm?"

Then, Jeon Myeonghun's next words made me flinch in surprise.

"I found out where Kang Minhee is through the disciples of Geumshin Cheonroe Mun who went to the Netherworld!"
