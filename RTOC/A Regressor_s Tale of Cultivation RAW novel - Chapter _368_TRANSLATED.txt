Holding Hands (4)

The interrogation of Liulin had concluded. There were two methods by which Liulin had attempted to betray us. The first was the characteristic of Penglaido, where all oaths and contracts would disappear upon entry. The second was another characteristic within Penglaido itself.

"Truly peculiar."

According to Liulin, the interior of Penglaido was a kind of massive illusion formation. Upon entering this illusion formation, the world inside would be reconstructed to match us, and we would become characters within the illusion, forced to explore the formation using only the powers and abilities of those characters.

"The power granted to those 'characters' is the power their original race possessed..."

For me and others, it would be human strength. For Shihu and Liulin, it was obvious they would gain the powers of foxes and dragons. In short, he intended to betray us by using Penglaido's inherent characteristic of nullifying all oaths and contracts, combined with the formation's ability to nullify all powers except those originally possessed by the respective races.

"We could have been in quite a predicament."

However, even if we had been deceived and entered Penglaido as he intended, it seemed that neither I nor Kim Younghoon would have been in significant danger. Nullifying all cultivation except for the inherent strength of humans?

"We would still have been able to use martial arts."

Rumble!

It was currently night in the Goryeok Realm. Unlike the Minggui Realm, which was divided only by the presence or absence of constellations, the Goryeok Realm had a clear distinction between day and night. The ring-like structure in the sky of the Goryeok Realm emitted a light similar to moonlight, creating a dim nighttime atmosphere.

After conquering Jeongryongdo, we were heading to another sea area to join the Northern Fleet, with Liulin captured. We would likely see Songjin soon. I was at the edge of the Guangyin Region, looking at the night sea of the Goryeok Realm, and then turned around.

The ghosts of the Minggui Realm were more energetic at night than during the day, and they were now having a ghostly feast, excited from their volunteer work on Jeongryongdo. They seemed proud of their efforts. Watching them, I fell into thought.

"If the fixed condition of my regression is truly to visit the Water Realm... should I go once more?"

The Water Realm was a place of immense fear. Just sensing the presence of the Lord of Salt Mountain there had filled me with overwhelming terror and despair. That world was filled with boundless malice and ominousness. But...

"If even they disappear..."

I couldn't imagine how my heart would break. Initially, the sect was created just to accumulate cultivation, but now they had become a part of me.

Buzz—

My consciousness swept through the Guangyin Region. The ghostly creatures boasting about their volunteer work on Jeongryongdo, the split soul of Yeonwi temporarily out of Yeonjin's body, and the Guardian Ghost Kings praising her. Weishihun and Yinwa, focused on creating a second generation. Baeklin, nursing Liuyou's wounds. Shihu, receiving a massage from Seoran. Jeon Myunghoon, practicing cultivation techniques alone with Yeonjin in a room. Oh Hyunseok, training ghostly creatures who wanted to grow stronger using the methods of the Great Heaven and Earth Sect. Kim Yeon and Bukhyanghwa, drunk and fighting, pulling each other's hair.

"Peaceful."

No matter how ominous the Water Realm might be, if I could return and continue to be with them, I would go back anytime.

"After investigating the Salt Mountain of Penglaido and finding a way to heal Cheongmunryeong."

I would descend to the Water Realm and, if possible, fix my regression.

"Yes, if I can go to the Water Realm in this life, I will go again."

With that resolve, I looked around at the night sea of the Goryeok Realm.

Buzz—

The night sea of the Goryeok Realm was incredibly mysterious.

Swoosh—

The sound of the waves crashing seemed to echo. Amidst that sound, countless voices could be heard. Simultaneously, beyond the myriad voices, the entire sea of the Goryeok Realm faintly glowed.

Whisper, whisper...

Above the undulating seawater, countless shadows appeared and disappeared repeatedly. How long had I been watching this?

"Eunhyun, you shouldn't stare at the deep sea for too long at night in the Goryeok Realm."

"...Younghoon hyung...?"

I turned around to see Kim Younghoon, who had called me. He had a bruise on one eye, and his clothes were torn in several places.

Sizzle—

Kim Younghoon seemed to be healing himself with a healing talisman.

"I thought you weren't injured when fighting Liulin?"

"Oh, this? I got this from Oh Hyunseok."

"Excuse me?"

"I was drinking with Oh Hyunseok, and his cultivation technique seemed similar to the path I once pursued, so I asked him how he trained. Then he offered to train me. So I agreed, and that crazy guy tied me to a pillar and..."

"...I see."

It seemed he had been temporarily trained in the methods of the Great Heaven and Earth Sect. Previously, Kim Younghoon had discovered that his martial arts had similarities with the techniques of the Yosu Sect and had tried to train in them. It seemed that this iteration of Kim Younghoon had also briefly attempted that path.

"But you didn't retaliate against Hyunseok hyung?"

"It's okay to get hit a bit by a close younger brother. Would it be right to draw a sword over that?"

"Then why do you..."

"Because if I don't draw a sword against you, I feel like I'll die."

Kim Younghoon laughed heartily, and after the healing talisman had fully healed his wounds, he removed it and placed his hand on his sword hilt.

"Are you going to do it again?"

"Haha, all my beloved swords are broken. If I fight you again, I'll just get beaten up without resistance. I came for a different reason."

Buzz—

He drew his sword and swung it in the air. He didn't strike at me or attack. There wasn't even a hint of killing intent, but I saw an illusion of the world splitting before my eyes.

"...While fighting you, I glimpsed the next realm."

"...!"

I shuddered at his words. There was only one thing that could be the 'next realm' for Kim Younghoon.

"Could it be... the Second Step of the Predecessor? The same realm as Jangik?"

I was startled, but then I thought of Kim Younghoon's nature and chuckled.

"Then in about 50 years, I can receive guidance from you, Younghoon hyung."

"...No, that's not it."

"Then 100 years?"

"Not that either."

"I can wait a few hundred years."

"......"

However, Kim Younghoon seemed to grow more somber at my hopeful questions.

"...Hyung?"

"...For now."

He spoke with a bitter expression.

"Even with my talent, it would take hundreds of years of relentless effort to see the possibility of reaching the next realm."

"Haha, it seems you haven't yet adapted to the sense of time in the cultivation world, Younghoon hyung."

"But."

However, he bit his lip and looked at me with a gloomy gaze.

"I cannot reach the next realm."

"Excuse me...?"

I stared at Kim Younghoon for a moment before bursting into laughter.

"Hahaha!!!"

It wasn't mockery; it was genuine amusement. How many times had I heard Kim Younghoon say that?

"Hyung! Believe in yourself. You can do it!"

By now, it was almost a rule that whenever Kim Younghoon said that, he would reach the next realm. Although he had often been hindered by lifespan issues before, now that he had reached this realm and gained an additional ten thousand years of life, it was more than enough!

However, Kim Younghoon's expression did not brighten. He silently raised his sword. I watched him for a moment before drawing my Colorless Glass Sword.

"Let's just purely compete in martial arts."

"Sounds good."

In the next moment, Kim Younghoon and I charged at each other, exchanging martial arts. Neither of us used excessive internal energy or magical power. We only channeled the vitality flowing through our human bodies into our swords, competing in skill.

As we exchanged moves, our movements gradually became more intense. Kim Younghoon spun from right to left, swinging his sword. His blade grazed my cheek. My sword slashed upward from my right foot, leaving a vertical scratch under his eye.

Clang! Clang!

Even though we only used basic vitality, the amplification of power at our level was tremendous. Kim Younghoon and I moved from one end of the Guangyin Region to the other in an instant, dancing to cut each other's shadows. He was too fast to follow, and I was too free to hit.

As we roamed the entire Guangyin Region, I suddenly realized we had left the Guangyin Region and arrived above the vast void, the night sea of the Goryeok Realm. Of course, we could still move while stepping on the void, so it didn't hinder our duel.

Rumble!

Before we knew it, the Guangyin Region had passed us, heading towards the horizon of the sea. It was moving towards the 'wall' made of the firmament, the edge of the sea area, to leave the Weizheng Sea.

Clang!

As we continued exchanging blows, I momentarily lost my balance due to Kim Younghoon's attack and almost fell into the deep sea.

Splash!

Fortunately, I managed to float back up, enveloped in the Total Heaven Sword, just before falling into the deep sea. But at that moment, I saw something astonishing.

Thud—

A clear sound echoed, and Kim Younghoon stood on the 'surface' of the deep sea.

"...How did you do that?"

"It's not that hard. This isn't real water but a kind of dimension, so just think of it as standing on a dimension."

"...So how do you do that?"

"Just stand on the dimension. You just need to balance well."

"......"

I gave up trying to understand and just floated near the surface of the deep sea. Kim Younghoon chuckled briefly, and then illusions appeared around him. They were the same illusions I had seen at the edge of the Guangyin Region earlier. The faces of the illusions were not clear, appearing only as hazy shadows. But as I watched the shadows, I felt a strange sense of familiarity.

Then, Kim Younghoon pointed his sword at one of the illusions that had approached him and spoke.

"The sea of the Goryeok Realm reflects the past of the subject. So sometimes, I think of Earth while looking at the night sea. Although it's annoying when faces I don't like are reflected..."

"Ah..."

"That's right. This sense of familiarity..."

I realized the nature of the familiarity I felt from the night sea of the Goryeok Realm. It was reflecting the myriad connections of my past. Kim Younghoon, who had been pointing his sword at a nearby illusion, warned me with a cautious look.

"Be careful. Sometimes deep-sea monsters disguise themselves as ordinary illusions and attack."

He swung his sword, cutting down the illusion. The illusion vanished, and the shadow that had been wielding a whip-like appendage from its arm disappeared. Kim Younghoon, having cut down the illusion, asked me.

"I'll ask you, Seo Eunhyun. What do you think martial arts (武) is?"

"...I don't know."

It's too vast to define simply, and too easy to guess too difficultly. That is the meaning of martial arts (武).

"Perhaps I am not a martial artist."

For me, martial arts were a part of life, but not everything. At the same time, it was one of my strengths, along with the many cultivation techniques I had learned, so I couldn't confidently say I knew what martial arts (武) was.

However, Kim Younghoon chuckled and said.

"You are a martial artist. I guarantee it."

"Even though I use not only martial arts but also cultivation techniques and Yosu techniques?"

"Well... I can be sure you're a martial artist because I've seen someone who wasn't a martial artist."

Buzz—

The same illusion Kim Younghoon had cut down earlier rose again and attacked him. He seemed slightly annoyed but ignored the illusion this time. The illusion passed through Kim Younghoon, and I realized I had seen its outline somewhere before.

"That person..."

It was Jinmayeol, the leader of the Tumahae Pirates, who had fought Jeon Myunghoon. Kim Younghoon glanced at the illusion and spoke.

"When I first came to the Goryeok Realm, I fought the leader of a notorious pirate group. Surprisingly, he had been at the level of the Heavenly Realm for thousands of years. At first, I thought he was a martial artist and treated him with respect. But after a few exchanges, I realized he wasn't a martial artist."

"Not a martial artist..."

It was strange. He had clearly reached the level of the Heavenly Realm. Perhaps he had reached it after fighting Kim Younghoon and gaining enlightenment. Why did Kim Younghoon not recognize him as a martial artist?

"That's why I took his weapon. It was too good a sword for someone who wasn't a martial artist. The living sword you broke was his."

"Oh, I remember."

Indeed, it was a tough sword, and it took some time to tear it apart. I asked curiously.

"Why wasn't he a martial artist?"

Liulin had protected his vision with a magical artifact, indicating he had a perfect view of the heart. Moreover, if he had reached the Heavenly Realm after merging, his efforts would have been indescribable. So why did Kim Younghoon not recognize him as a martial artist?

Kim Younghoon was silent for a moment before raising his sword.

"...I'll show you why I can't reach the next realm. Then you'll understand."

Thud, thud—

He began to perform a sword dance, stepping on dimensions. The surrounding illusions, remnants of the past, were cut down by his dance. Strangely, his movements left no afterimages. It was as if Kim Younghoon existed only in the 'present moment.' It was a metaphysical expression, but it was true. His celestial energy couldn't be read, and his next move couldn't be predicted. It felt like he was invisible in the boundaries of history and fate. Existing but not existing, his sword dance ended in a strange void, and I gasped.

Even with limited talent, I could tell as someone who had wielded a sword for thousands of years.

"...You said you didn't name the next realm because of Cheongmunryeong, right?"

"Well, yes."

"In reality, you had already named it."

I softly uttered the name that resonated in his dance.

The First Step of the Predecessor.

What did Kim Younghoon name this realm?

"Isn't it 'Sitting and Standing Death' (坐脫立亡)?"
