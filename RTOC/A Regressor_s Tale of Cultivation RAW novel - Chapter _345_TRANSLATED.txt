### The Deceased (6)

**Uwoong—**

Kim Yeon focused her consciousness, her eyes gleaming. Before her stood a shadow and a skeletal commander. Both were at the level of a low-tier demon. She assumed a stance. She had recently ascended to the level of a celestial being. The way to reach the realm of a celestial being was through immersion in a single concept. So, what was the emotion she immersed herself in? If she had heard the truth of Seo Eun-hyeon's heart before, she might have vaguely felt this emotion was love. But upon hearing the truth and contemplating her feelings, Kim Yeon realized it wasn't love.

'Then what is this emotion?' Kim Yeon thought. This emotion was directed towards Seo Eun-hyeon. But it wasn't simply love. So what was it? 'A name. This emotion needs a name.' This emotion also held the heart of a ghostly army. It held a longing for home. It held loyalty towards her comrades. To organize her heart. To determine her attitude towards her master. To further solidify her longing and loyalty. Kim Yeon wanted to name this emotion.

"By the way, it's surprising. That infamous Ghost King is only at the level of a celestial being…."

Umwa and Baekrin each took out their magical treasures. Kim Yeon remained silent, focusing her consciousness. She recalled when Seo Eun-hyeon taught her martial arts in her dreams.

—Yeon-ah, your talent in cultivation is much higher than mine, but your talent in martial arts is… similar to or lower than mine.

—Huh! Then what should I do? I need to learn martial arts to have a chance to escape….

—Don't worry. I was also a slow learner, so I'm confident in teaching you. First….

At that time, Seo Eun-hyeon told her.

—Let's endlessly repeat the Biikmu.

—What?

—It might feel a bit boring, but for those without talent, endless repetition is the shortest path to mastery. I know from experience.

From that day, under Seo Eun-hyeon's guidance, she endlessly practiced the martial art called Biikmu. Strangely, the Biikmu she learned was quite similar to the movements of the ghostly army's [her]. At the same time, it had some connection with her own peculiar heart technique, so learning Biikmu actually helped her peculiar heart technique. At first, she thought she would go crazy from the boredom. Repeating the same movements with a fan over and over. Of course, it was much better than being with the ghostly army at that time, so she gratefully did as she was told, but it wasn't an activity she particularly liked. However, as she mastered Biikmu and reached a certain 'realm' of it, the boring activity gradually faded away.

The true essence of Biikmu was not in holding a fan and dancing, but in the continuity of movements. The beginning and the end were connected, and the lost power was somewhat restored. As long as the beginning and the end could be connected, it didn't matter whether she held a fan, a spear, stood on her head, or spun like a top.

'But Biikmu itself lacks offensive power.'

Therefore, she secretly learned a new martial art from Seo Eun-hyeon. 

**Sreung—**

Kim Yeon lowered her hand. At some point, four hidden weapons were in her hand. She combined the Biikmu created by Seo Eun-hyeon with a new martial art taught by Hongbeom, keeping it a secret from Seo Eun-hyeon.

—Kim Yeon, this martial art combines the Yonghyeongbihogyo and the Tugoeam techniques. While the Biikmu you are currently practicing is well-suited for training your peculiar heart technique, this martial art will likely increase your direct combat power significantly.

—Ah, thank you.

—No need for formalities. I'm younger than you.

—…Ah, yes…. But I'll still use formalities. Anyway, what's the name of this martial art?

—I haven't named it.

Hongbeom demonstrated numerous martial arts in front of Kim Yeon.

—Based on the martial arts taught by the master, I created and combined various martial arts such as fist techniques, leg techniques, spear techniques, sword techniques, fan techniques, and claw techniques. But… I haven't named any of them.

—Why not?

—Well, I don't think names are meaningful in martial arts. Maybe I'll name them after integrating all these martial arts.

—That's impressive. Does Eun-hyeon oppa know about your martial arts?

—Ah, it's a secret from the master. I want to surprise him later. Haha….

Hongbeom, a genius with monstrous talent, learned Biikmu from a self-proclaimed slow learner and this martial art from a genius. 

**Uwoong—**

Inside the formation, Kim Yeon's consciousness filled the entire space. The pressure from her consciousness darkened the faces of Baekrin and Umwa.

"Is this the consciousness of a celestial being…?"

"Unbelievable… Could it be that the Ghost King is just a low-tier demon?"

Kim Yeon smiled faintly and raised her hand.

"You seem to have the leisure to talk."

**Bwoong—**

In the next moment, Kim Yeon's fingertips swung towards the two ghostly creatures.

**Kwaaang!**

The four hidden weapons flew like the claws of a giant beast, slashing through the air. At the level of a celestial being, Kim Yeon's attack, imbued with her consciousness, was amplified within the formation, unleashing a powerful strike.

"Ugh, what is this…!"

Baekrin blocked her attack with his magical treasure, gasping for breath. Kim Yeon lowered her hand. Threads of consciousness flowed from her fingertips, merging with her qi to form tangible threads of energy. These threads were connected to the four flying knives she had taken out.

"Ugh! What is that sorcery!?" Baekrin asked in a terrified voice, and Kim Yeon lowered her other hand as well.

**Charang—**

From her other hand, four more flying knives connected to the threads of energy dangled. Kim Yeon took a step forward, swinging the flying knives connected to the threads.

"Well, let's call it claw technique for now."

**Hwoong—**

**Kwagwagwang!**

Like the swing of a giant claw, a total of eight slashes flew towards the two ghostly creatures. And then, Kim Yeon began to dance. Her dance, scattering countless slashes, looked more beautiful than anything else.

**Kwaaagwagwang!**

The formation couldn't withstand the slashes and began to shake. Although a gap appeared in the formation, giving Baekrin and Umwa a chance to escape, they couldn't think of running away. Even if there was a gap in the formation, there was no gap in her domain. When her flying knives, her [claws], swung, slashes scattered. But the slashes 'connected' again. The slashes continued endlessly, without losing power.

Originally, Biikmu was just a technique similar to Seo Eun-hyeon's Mountain-Within-Mountain Formation. But when the power of a celestial being was added to Biikmu, it gained a new characteristic.

**Kugugugu—**

Due to Kim Yeon's celestial guidance, the energy of heaven and earth was drawn to her. While performing Biikmu, her power was hardly consumed, and as the energy of heaven and earth was drawn in, her power only increased. It was a monstrous technique that grew stronger the more it was used.

The two ghostly creatures gritted their teeth, unable to find a way out of the increasingly powerful storm of slashes.

"Ugh, we can't be defeated like this!"

"Behind us are the countless wills of the ghostly creatures of Baekumyeok! We can't lose to a demonic cult that brainwashes and forces submission!"

Kim Yeon heard their words and smiled bitterly.

"Brainwashing? That's nonsense. Our Muguk Cult adheres to exemplary and advanced working hours, not exceeding 20 hours in seven days, with fair wages paid monthly and decent welfare and benefits provided to the followers. We have won their hearts, not forced submission through brainwashing."

"Ugh, I don't understand what language you're speaking."

"It's the demonic cult's words. Don't be swayed, Baek Munju!"

**Kugugugugu!**

However, at that moment, countless slashes merged into one and shot towards the two low-tier demons.

"Ugh! What monstrous power…!"

"What kind of power output is this…!"

Originally, when martial artists and cultivators fought, martial artists used superior techniques to break the cultivator's spells, and cultivators crushed the martial artist's techniques with overwhelming power. But now, a strange scene was unfolding. Kim Yeon's martial arts, influenced by her combined-level consciousness, were pushing the cultivators with overwhelming power.

Baekrin and Umwa used all kinds of techniques and spells, looking for a gap in Kim Yeon's slashes.

"There! That's the gap!"

"Quick, escape!"

Umwa and Baekrin combined their strength. The energy of a giant white skeleton gathered, and a dark shadow covered it. The energy of a giant black skeleton flew towards a point in the formation. Baekrin recalled the skeletal commanders who enjoyed their work with a kind expression. Umwa recalled the innocent ghosts who valued obedience and submission. The two ghostly creatures held hands, praying for the peace of Baekumyeok, and gathered all their strength.

"Taaah!"

"Haaah!"

**Flash!**

Finally, the two ghostly creatures managed to escape the domain of the vicious Ghost King before being swept away by her slashes.

**Kugugugu!**

Looking back at the collapsing formation, the two hurried towards the center of the Muguk Cult, where the demonic cult leader, the Muguk Ghost King, resided.

"Huff, huff, huff…."

Baekrin and Umwa ran, panting as if they were still alive.

"That place…."

"The residence of the Muguk Ghost King…! The Muguk Cult Hall!"

They arrived at a place covered entirely in a dark curse, panting heavily.

"As expected of the demonic cult leader, the building is wrapped in curses."

"Just looking at it, it's an evil curse. Break it quickly!"

The two ghostly creatures gathered their strength and threw their magical treasures at the building.

**Kwagwagwagwang!**

And then, with a roar and a cloud of dust, Baekrin and Umwa flinched in surprise. A large figure was blocking their magical treasures in front of the Muguk Cult Hall.

"Is that the Extinction Ghost King…?"

"It's Uho Beop!"

And then, the dust settled.

"Wait…!"

"You…!"

However, after the dust settled, the two ghostly creatures were shocked to see who had blocked their magical treasures. It was Wi Si-hon.

"Sihoojongju! What are you doing!?"

"Wi Si-hon, you…."

Wi Si-hon smiled slyly and raised his arm.

**Wiiing—**

A strange circuit on Wi Si-hon's body emitted light.

"Ah, sorry. Originally, I was going to leave it to the Ghost King or the Six Extremes Ghost King, but the Ghost King let you escape, and the Six Extremes Ghost King had something to do."

Baekrin and Umwa looked at Wi Si-hon with bewildered expressions.

"Haha, don't look at me like that. To drive you deep into the cult, I had to pretend to sacrifice myself and push you from behind."

The two ghostly creatures gritted their teeth. Thinking back, it was Wi Si-hon who suggested attacking the demonic cult leader!

"You… trapped us in a trap!"

"Hahaha! I received the grace of the cult leader. It was truly overwhelming. And after looking around the Muguk Cult's welfare, it was better than our sect. I made the right choice to provide a better quality of life for our sect's zombies."

**Uwoong—**

Wi Si-hon shouted, his circuit glowing.

"Look! I was originally only at the mid-tier demon level, but after receiving the 'surgery' from the Ghost King and the 'grace' from the cult leader, I now possess power comparable to a high-tier demon! Hahaha!"

"Ugh, what are you talking about, Wi Si-hon! Didn't we agree to uphold the justice of Baekumyeok together!?"

"Justice? Justice is providing good bodies and advanced welfare to the weak ghostly creatures and zombies. The Muguk Cult is justice! You should join the Muguk Cult too. You've come this far anyway. You can't escape."

**Uwoong—**

Wi Si-hon flaunted the glowing circuit on his body and extended his hand to the two ghostly creatures.

"I'll make you an offer. Since you can't escape, as the guardian ghost king of the Muguk Cult, I'll give you a chance. I'll let you tour the Muguk Cult and experience it. After exploring the Muguk Cult, decide whether to join. I'm serious. The future of Baekumyeok is the Muguk Cult!"

Baekrin and Umwa, filled with rage, spoke.

"That's nonsense! How can we trust a demonic cult that brainwashes countless ghostly creatures!"

"Wi Si-hon, you must have been brainwashed too."

"Tsk…! Foolish! Doesn't everyone say it! It's not brainwashing but truly winning hearts!"

Baekrin raised his voice, burning with ghostly fire.

"Friend! How far have you been brainwashed!"

"…We can't communicate. Fine. I'll make you kneel and show you the truth."

**Wiiing—**

The circuit on Wi Si-hon's body burned brightly. The three ghostly creatures charged at each other.

**Uwoong—**

Kim Yeon, having lost the ghostly creatures, was forming hand seals without concern.

"Good, good. You're doing well."

Next to her, Yeonwi was teaching Kim Yeon.

"Yes, that's how you set up the formation. With your wide consciousness, you can fully utilize the formation's power."

"Yes, I'll do my best."

"Although you're not a disciple of the Golden Thunder Sect, so I can't teach you the Thunder Dao techniques, I'm glad I can teach you my formation knowledge. You're learning the formation well."

"You're too kind."

**Uwoong—**

Threads of consciousness from Kim Yeon's Peculiar Heart Technique spread out, covering the air. Her threads of consciousness covered the air, forming a cage that enveloped the entire Muguk Cult.

'To prevent intruders from escaping, firmly weave the air with consciousness, guide the flow of heaven and earth energy, and divide the space itself….'

**Kiiing—**

Kim Yeon completed the formation and smiled.

"Ah, it's done. Yeonwi-nim!"

"Excellent! Haha, you're a very good student."

Yeonwi looked at her with satisfaction and then asked a question.

"But I'm curious about one thing. Why do you follow that Seo guy?"

"Eh, what?"

"Honestly, I don't understand. Sure, that Seo guy has great abilities, but he has 19 heads, a weird hobby, and seems a bit crazy. I heard you liked him since your hometown, but why do you like such a guy?"

As soon as Yeonwi finished speaking, a scene from inside the formation entered Kim Yeon's mind. Baekrin and Umwa defeated the 'brainwashed traitor' Wi Si-hon and finally broke the curse barrier of the Muguk Cult Hall. The two ghostly creatures were entering the Muguk Cult Hall.

"Ah, they went in. Now they too…."

Yeonwi clicked his tongue, showing sympathy for the two ghostly creatures. Taking advantage of Yeonwi's distraction, Kim Yeon thought deeply.

'When did I start liking Eun-hyeon oppa?'

She naturally recalled her early days at the company. Thinking back, at first, Kim Yeon didn't particularly like Seo Eun-hyeon.

---

"Hello, I'm intern Jo Soo-hyun, starting today!"

"Oh, I'm intern Kim Yeon, starting today!"

"Starting today…."

Kim Yeon, who joined a soap company as an intern, was a bit nervous.

'Intern in the sales development department….'

The sales development department of this company had a bad reputation. The manager, Jeon Myeong-cheol, would organize weekend hikes. The deputy manager, Kim Young-hoon, didn't say much, but the section chief, Oh Hyun-seok, was known for working people hard. The assistant managers, Kang Min-hee and Jeon Myeong-hoon, one was gloomy, and the other was 'just the worst.'

But the scariest thing was something else.

"Hello, interns. Since it's your first day, you won't have much to do. Just follow me around and learn. I'm Seo Eun-hyeon, the assistant manager. You can call me Assistant Manager Seo. First, check your desks…."

Assistant Manager Seo Eun-hyeon. With dark circles under his eyes, living on coffee and energy drinks, always seeming in a bad mood due to acid reflux, that man. Kim Yeon was the first to be marked by Assistant Manager Seo on her first day.

"Kim Yeon, please follow quickly. We have many places to check. We also need to manage the inventory."

"I'm sorry."

"Kim Yeon, what if you drop that! Move quickly."

"Kim Yeon! Sigh… Never mind. Move aside."

Kim Yeon quickly realized that she would be the first to be dropped after the intern period.

'Assistant Manager Seo… is too scary.'

Seo Eun-hyeon, who muttered 'Jeon Myeong-hoon, that bastard' while drinking coffee, wasn't someone easy to approach at first. But other interns, being quite sociable, approached Seo Eun-hyeon easily. For the first three days, Kim Yeon struggled the most.

'Should I just quit before the intern period ends?'

At that time, Seo Eun-hyeon was known as the hardest worker in the department. In other words, he worked the hardest. And being assigned under such a person, Kim Yeon felt she was incompetent. Seo Eun-hyeon never rested at the company.

"Assistant Manager Seo, it's lunchtime…."

"Ah, Kim Yeon. Go have lunch. I'll finish this paperwork and join you. Other interns, go have lunch too."

While others went for lunch, Kim Yeon couldn't. 'I have to make up for my mistakes!' She gritted her teeth, finishing her tasks, even if her stomach was growling and she felt like dying from exhaustion, drinking bitter coffee to endure. Seo Eun-hyeon glanced at her occasionally but said nothing. As the intern period reached halfway, the atmosphere changed significantly.

"Hello, everyone."

"Ah, yes, hello… Assistant Manager…."

"Haha. Assistant Manager, hello…."

At first, everyone tried to get close to Seo Eun-hyeon, but as the intern period progressed, no one wanted to make eye contact with him. The only one who still made eye contact with Seo Eun-hyeon was Kim Yeon.

"Ah, hello, Assistant Manager!"

"Oh, Kim Yeon."

Seo Eun-hyeon spoke curtly to Kim Yeon.

"Good morning. Please deliver this document to the section chief,
