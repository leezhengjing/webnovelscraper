**Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 384: Together with Everyone (6)**

I was dumbfounded and asked again, "What if Yan Jianyue dies in the process?"

"Ah... I see. I'm sorry," Seran scratched his head awkwardly.

Shaking my head, I said, "From today, I plan to use this village as a base to hunt or subdue monsters like Shiho."

In the process, I intended to gather companions, expand my influence, and build a legacy. Seran pondered for a moment before asking, "So, you're planning to expand your influence anyway. Wouldn't it be better to overthrow the village and make it your base? After overthrowing the village, you could use the monsters to collect tributes and live while being worshipped."

'Why does this guy want to rule the village so badly?' I thought. Suddenly, I remembered that Seran had been worshipped as a dragon god on a small island when he was in the Qi Condensation stage.

"Hmm..." I glanced at Seran. Although his idea was somewhat unreliable, it wasn't entirely wrong. 'If we gather forces, we might end up looting for supplies anyway...'

It might be better to start with Tael Village and create a place to receive regular tributes. I recalled the purpose of this formation. 'According to the Six Scales Journal, this formation changes its details based on the memories of the entrants, but the goal remains the same each time.'

That goal was to become the king of the Penglai Kingdom. According to the information from Six Scales, there were several ways to become the king of Penglai. If one was lucky enough to be set as the crown prince, they could simply wait for the coronation. However, if the entrant was not the crown prince, they could marry the crown prince or princess to become the national scholar or queen. Of course, there were also cases where one could overthrow the Penglai Kingdom and establish themselves as the king without marrying the crown prince or princess.

Once one became the king or a figure close to the king, they would gain the authority to leave the illusion formation and the right to take or investigate the treasures of the royal castle. 'In terms of numbers, we have an overwhelming advantage.'

If the members of the Wujig Cult regained their memories, we could overthrow the Penglai Kingdom and I could proclaim myself king. However, according to Six Scales, those who entered first were closer to becoming the king of Penglai or had better conditions to become the king. They could be royalty, powerful officials, monsters, spirits, or other powerful beings.

'Six Scales said that in the last Penglai journey, he killed a monster that kidnapped the princesses of Penglai and married a princess to become the national scholar.' Once one became the king, national scholar, or queen, they could expel anyone from Penglai Island by royal decree.

'Given my current situation, those damn pirates are probably the closest to the throne.' It was uncertain whether they had regained their senses. Moreover, the current king of Penglai was in good health, so it would take a long time to succeed the throne. Therefore, I had only one option.

"It seems that overthrowing the Penglai Kingdom is the best choice."

Seran nodded. "Indeed! So, shall we conquer the village?"

"Wait. Conquering the village is not a good idea." I explained my plan to Seran. "So, you plan to subdue countless monsters, raise a monster army, attack the capital of Penglai Kingdom, and quickly seize the throne?"

"Yes. Considering that there are no other mystical powers or sorcery in this world, this method is the best."

"Well... I understand. Let's do it that way." Seran seemed disappointed that he wouldn't be worshipped by the villagers, but that wasn't my concern. We immediately made a plan and returned to Shiho to give orders.

"We need some resources to subdue the monsters. Shiho! Go hunt something like a wild boar."

Shiho glanced at me, then moved only after Seran repeated my words. "...He only listens to you."

"...He seems to like me."

A while later, Shiho returned with a large cow. The cow blinked its big eyes, seemingly unaware of the situation. "...I told you to catch a wild boar, but you brought a village cow."

And it was alive. "Where did you get it from?" Seran asked. Shiho pointed in the direction of the neighboring village, Soeul Village. I nodded. "...Well, it's not from our village, so we can sell it to Tael Village."

Feeling a bit guilty, I decided to think positively and led the cow to the village. "Elder Yan Jianyue! Please open the door!"

When I knocked on Yan Jianyue's door, he appeared with a few servants, looking angry. "What do you want this time, you scoundrel!"

"I'm not here to ask for anything. I'm here to sell a cow."

Yan Jianyue's eyes widened when he saw the cow behind me. "Where did you get this cow?"

"Does it matter where I got it? I'm offering it to you at a low price, so please give me a good deal."

"Hmm... This seems suspicious. You're not trying to sell me a sick cow, are you?"

"If you don't want to buy it, I'll sell it to someone else."

"Who said I wouldn't buy it! I need to discuss this with my husband, so wait here."

A while later, Yan Jianyue returned with his husband, Nolbu Daegam. After inspecting the cow, Nolbu Daegam nodded. "It's a good cow. I'll buy it at a fair price."

"Haha, you don't need to be so formal. You can speak casually."

When I tried to be humble, he frowned and said, "Learn some manners, you insolent brat!"

"...?" I didn't understand Nolbu's strange attitude, but I sold the cow to him for forty coins. 'Well, Hyeonwon always had a mental illness, so maybe this reflects that.'

After sending the cow to the barn with the servants, Yan Jianyue said to his wife, "Dear, since he sold us a valuable cow, give him some rice cakes as a token of gratitude. The Seo family has many mouths to feed..."

"But we don't even know if the cow he sold us is any good... Besides, the Seo family is not a farming family but a charcoal seller, so they probably sold us an unnecessary cow..."

"Dear! We're already short on livestock due to the monsters. Be grateful and don't argue."

"Yes, yes..." Yan Jianyue seemed a bit annoyed but obediently packed some rice cakes in a basket and handed them to me. '...She packed the oldest rice cakes.'

I clicked my tongue but accepted them gratefully and left Nolbu Daegam's house. As I left, I heard Nolbu whispering to Yan Jianyue. "I'm sorry, dear. But it's not because I hate you..."

"I know." Yan Jianyue seemed pleased with Nolbu's apology and giggled. In the distant field, Jeon Myeonghun was farming with his wife, Geum Sohae, and their twelve children. '...If this is a dream or an illusion...'

Would they want to wake up even if they realized it? I wondered.

* * *

With the money I received from Yan Jianyue, I went to the blacksmith in the neighboring village to buy a sword and greaves. In Tael Village, my notoriety was so well-known that they refused to sell me anything, thinking I might cause trouble.

"Hehe, I usually only supply the military, but you seem like a filial young man, so I'll sell it to you specially." The blacksmith in the neighboring village laughed heartily and took three-quarters of the money I got from selling the cow. It was a ridiculously high price, but I paid it without complaint, fearing he might report me to the authorities.

'Once I conquer the Penglai Kingdom, I won't have to worry about the price of a sword.' With that, the preparations were roughly complete. Srrng- Although it wasn't an excellent sword, it was still an iron sword. Seran looked at the iron sword skeptically and asked, "Um... Senior, if we can't use our spiritual power or internal energy, don't we need more weapons? I've been living as a human for a few days, and I find that humans have poor durability and strength compared to yokai..."

But I silently swung the iron sword. The three-foot-tall rock next to me and Seran was cleanly split in one strike. I had wielded swords for thousands of years. "What nonsense are you talking about?"

I had reached a level where I could cut flesh with straw. "This one sword is enough." With the iron sword and enough time, I was confident I could fight and devastate the Penglai Kingdom's army alone. After tapping the iron sword a few times with my finger, I climbed onto Shiho's back.

"I'm going to gather some monsters from other regions. Are you coming?"

"...I don't think I can be of much help, so I'll stay here and get used to the human body."

"Alright. While I'm gone, get some nets and needles. The more needles, the better. Let's go!"

I hit Shiho on the back of the head, and he quickly started crossing the mountains.

One day, strange rumors began circulating in the Penglai Kingdom. It was said that a monster king had appeared and was gathering all the monsters in the country. According to the rumors, the monster king planned to attack the capital and become the king of Penglai, turning the world into a land of monsters. Eventually, the king of Penglai announced that anyone who defeated the monster king would marry the princess, and the best warriors in the country headed to Tael Village to capture the monster king.

Among them was Jin Mayeol, a member of the prestigious Jin family and the most powerful family in the capital. "I can't stand the thought of a monster king threatening the country."

Jin Mayeol, who had been exceptionally talented since childhood, excelled in archery and swordsmanship. Despite his family's objections, he headed to Tael Village. "Why would a talent like you risk your life in Tael Village! You are a strong candidate for the next prince consort!"

"Don't stop me. What use is it to become the prince consort when the kingdom is in turmoil!"

No one in the Jin family could stop Jin Mayeol's decision, and he was eventually locked in a room by the head of the family. "Tie up that foolish boy and lock him in the warehouse!"

They couldn't afford to lose a talent like Jin Mayeol. However, Jin Mayeol cut the ropes binding him in the middle of the night, stole a weapon and a horse, and escaped. 'Mother, Father, forgive me. But I cannot ignore this great calamity after receiving the grace of the kingdom!'

As Jin Mayeol was crossing the capital, someone with a covered face approached him. "Who goes there!" Jin Mayeol, tense, drew his bow from his pack and aimed at the person. The person revealed their face. "No way!"

Jin Mayeol was shocked. "P-Princess Yukyo!"

It was Princess Yukyo, with whom Jin Mayeol had discussed marriage. "Let's go together, Jin Gongja."

"What nonsense is this, Princess!"

"I want to protect the country too. No more words. Aren't you sneaking out to protect the country, avoiding your family's eyes?"

"Princess and I..."

"No more words. If you keep trying to stop me, I'll scream and alert everyone that you're escaping."

"...!"

"If I scream in the middle of the night, you know what will happen next, right?"

Jin Mayeol frowned and said, "...Fine. But you must not participate in the fight! If you insist..."

"Alright, I'll listen to you. Just let me ride with you."

Yukyo nodded and climbed onto the horse behind Jin Mayeol, who rode with a grim expression. Holding onto Jin Mayeol from behind, Yukyo looked tense. '...I've got my chance. I must join the cult leader. Jin Mayeol must not regain his senses before then...'

Biting her lip, she headed to Tael Village with Jin Mayeol. Along the way, Jin Mayeol gained more companions besides Princess Yukyo. They included Six Scales, the son of the Dragon King of the East Sea, Kim Yeonghun, a passing scholar, and Baekrin, a shaman who could see ghosts. Together, they headed to Tael Village. Finally, they arrived and faced the monster king, Seo Eunhyun.

The monster king was indeed strong. In one strike, he severed the arm of Six Scales, the son of the Dragon King. Kim Yeonghun, the most skilled martial artist among them, seemed to hold his own against Seo Eunhyun but was overwhelmed by the sheer number of monsters under Seo Eunhyun's command. Baekrin, who claimed to summon ghosts, was knocked out by Seo Eunhyun before he could summon any. In the end, Jin Mayeol and Six Scales had no choice but to flee.

"No, Six Scales! Princess Yukyo is still there!"

"You fool! The monster king is unbeatable. Forget the princess!"

"Damn it!" Jin Mayeol swallowed his anger. "Why! Why can I only run away!!!"

Grinding his teeth, he fled with Six Scales. "I will return! Monster king!!!"

* * *

Clang- I threw away the sword that had become dull from fighting Six Scales. "It's so unfair. I'm just a human with no mystical powers, but Six Scales can transform into a dragon, breathe fire, fly, and has tough scales."

Moreover, Seran, who was also a dragon, was strangely human. "I don't understand the bizarre rules of this world."

I looked at Yukyo in front of me. "So far, no one has regained their senses except me, Seran, and you, Yukyo."

She bowed before me. "Greetings, cult leader."

"...Yes. Nice to see you."

Though, honestly, I wasn't pleased. I would have preferred a more reliable companion to regain their senses, but it was Yukyo, a swindler, who regained her senses after Seran. "By the way, did you say you were a princess?"

"...Yes."

"Good. I'm planning to take over the Penglai Kingdom, so marry Seran to legitimize my claim."

I was startled by Yukyo's next words. "I refuse."

"...? What did you just say..."

"Instead, I will reveal the secrets and truths of this world and all of Six Scales' schemes. Becoming the king will be easy compared to that, so please be satisfied with this."

"......" I stared at Yukyo for a moment before asking, "Do you know something? If so, why didn't you say anything when Six Scales was captured outside?"

"My father sealed my memories, so I didn't know anything at that time. My memories returned when I came back to Penglai Island. Contracts and agreements from the outside world don't apply here."

"...You 'returned' to Penglai Island?"

I was shocked by her next words. "I was born on Penglai Island. My father killed the underground monster during the last Penglai journey, married my mother, and took me and many other children to the outside world."

"What...?"

"...Now, I will tell you the truth about this world."
