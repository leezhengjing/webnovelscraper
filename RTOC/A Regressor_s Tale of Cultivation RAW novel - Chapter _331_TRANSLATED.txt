The light faded, and I realized my body was in shambles. "Damn, I feel like I'm going to die." But my spirits were soaring. I knew it. Seo Hyul had truly suffered significant damage from me. He was always a liar, but it was true that his plans had been pushed back considerably. He had sacrificed the Obokchuk he cherished so much, so he would be busy trying to recover it. Considering the damage I inflicted on him through the Karma Fire, he wouldn't be able to show his face or act for a long time.

Cough, cough! I spat out blood and collapsed on the spot. I sensed the presence of several members of the Yongrin Clan from afar. It seemed they were coming to check since the presence of the monsters had faded. I didn't have the strength to lift a finger. The Yongrin Clan wasn't on good terms with the human race, so if I got caught, it would be quite troublesome. Of course, even in my weakened state, I had ways to move, but I continued to lie there.

Boom! Lightning flashed as Jeon Myunghun clicked his tongue with an irritated expression. "You bastard... Can't you just stay still and talk before moving?"

The Karma Fire that had attached to Seo Hyul through me had already extinguished inside Jeon Myunghun. Originally, the Karma Fire was meant to burn only me, but the recent situation where Seo Hyul tried to take over my very existence was unusual, so it wasn't strange that the fire had extinguished from him.

Hong Beom, who had flown over with Jeon Myunghun, supported me. "Let's head to the human territory first, but let's do some emergency treatment before that."

"What emergency treatment? A good sleep will heal everything."

"If you rely solely on your vitality as a Shachukgi, you'll end up in trouble."

Hong Beom took out some poisons from his Jeomuldo, mixed them on the spot, and poured something into my mouth. I felt a surge of vitality and enhanced regeneration. As expected of Hong Beom, who had reached the pinnacle in the field of medicinal poisons, the effects were remarkable.

"Now that the treatment is done, let's get out of here. Staying in this foreign land could be dangerous."

Jeon Myunghun grabbed the back of my and Hong Beom's necks and used the Bidun Technique. Boom! We were enveloped in a streak of red lightning and flew towards the human territory.

A week passed like that. We arrived in the human territory, officially registered 'Jaebiseung' in the records of the Siundo Myungjeok, and Jeon Myunghun officially lifted my bounty in the name of the elder of the Geumshinchunraemun. Then, we headed to the Noryeongdo.

Boom! In my past life, I couldn't find it because I was eroded by Seo Hyul and lived as Seorip. Together with Jeon Myunghun, I went to the ruins of the Geumshinchunraemun in Noryeongdo, where Hong Suryung had died. Although her funeral was held in the lower world, her remains were here.

Step, step... There was no trace of her body where Hong Suryung had died, perhaps because I had turned it into soil through the Yin Soul Ghost Art. I swept the soil where she had died. This soil was her remains. Jeon Myunghun went to find the eastern part of Geumsohae, and Hong Beom gave us some space.

Crack— Using the wood attribute technique, I created a wooden shovel, slowly dug the ground, and buried the soil that had absorbed Hong Suryung's body. Then, I made a small mound, sat in front of it, and poured a drink.

"It's been a while. I'm back."

Drip... Thinking back, it was something I should have done immediately after returning to my past life. But I had overlooked it because of Seo Hyul.

"Is it comfortable there?"

There was no answer.

"I hope the god of death is kind to others, even if he is cold to us."

I hope you are at peace after death. Lamenting might seem ugly and pathetic, but perhaps such pathetic things are necessary in human life. I muttered and lamented in front of the mound for a while. The resentment of ghosts accumulates because they cannot convey it to people. Maybe because I am also a ghost who cannot die even in death, just talking to Hong Suryung like this lightened my heart a bit.

Evening came. Only then did I finish speaking.

"...Anyway, a lot has happened."

There was no answer. But even if it made me sad, my heart felt at ease. The return was fixed, and the bond with Hong Suryung did not fade over time. It did not disappear into nothingness. I bid farewell to Hong Suryung and left the place with the mound.

'Hyanghwa...'

What if the return had been fixed after she died? She wouldn't be able to move alive, but 'that' Bukhyanghwa, who spent time with me, would not disappear. Suddenly, I recalled the feelings Seorip had left for me in my past life, the feelings of sympathy for me.

—Even if his body turns to soil, his soul will return and repeat life eternally.
—Even if his body remains here, his soul will go to another time and never be able to reminisce about the bonds that remembered him.
—Only the records stored in the Mansanginyundo will warmly but sadly comfort Seoeunhyun.

Rustle— Suddenly, the Mansanginyundo naturally unfolded around me. It was filled with cherished memories. To others, it might look like mere empty mist, but to me, they were irreplaceable pillars of my heart.

Swoosh— I reached out to the past selves who laughed and chatted, cried and shed tears, bled and raged within the Mansanginyundo. My hand passed through them so emptily. They were just records, after all.

"..."

I stared at it for a moment. And then, I saw an annoying gaze from within the Mansanginyundo. It was Seo Hyul. Somehow, he was also inside this.

—Haha, you must feel wronged to be defeated by me despite creating such a terrifying technique and not using it.

I looked at him and then at the Mansanginyundo, setting my goal for this life.

'This life...'

"Shall I uncover the secrets of the Mansanginyundo?"

How did Bukhyanghwa access my Mansanginyundo? Is he still inside somewhere? What exactly is the relationship with my Seonju bloodline? And can the Mansanginyundo counter Seo Hyul's Takheonmangcheon? Perhaps, by reverse erosion, I might be able to track his true body. Uncovering the secrets of the Mansanginyundo was crucial.

And most importantly.

Rustle— I looked at my hand passing through the scenes of the Mansanginyundo and smiled bitterly. The memory of watching the sunset with Kang Minhee at Namsan, which Seorip cherished so much, flashed through my mind. I would delve deeper into the Mansanginyundo. Simply watching it was too sad. Just as Seorip thought, the Mansanginyundo was so warm but so lonely. To feel this warmth better, the primary goal of this life was to find a way to manifest the power of the Mansanginyundo externally. It was a goal related to the problem of my Seonju bloodline, the issue of countering Seo Hyul's Takheonmangcheon, and the matter of Bukhyanghwa entering the Mansanginyundo. It was the most important issue for now.

'Save Kim Yeondo, save Kang Minhee, save Oh Hyunseok.'

My power is no longer lacking. I have the right to save what I want to save. Saving them wasn't even a goal anymore. It was a given.

I rose to the sky and looked towards where Jeon Myunghun was. He was caressing a wooden box held by her hand with a sentimental expression, looking at the sky.

"Hong Beom."

"Yes, master."

I spoke to Hong Beom, who was waiting.

"I'll be going to Cheonin Island for a while. Tell Jeon Myunghun that I went to Cheonin Island to obtain the qualification of Taesu and give him this martial arts manual."

"Yes, understood."

I took out a jade scroll from the Jeomuldo, recorded the formula of the Yukgeuk Eumraeshin, and handed it to Hong Beom.

"I'll be back in a few days, so tell him to master it by then."

"Hmm, it looks like a quite profound martial art..."

"If it's a Noryeong martial art, there's nothing Jeon Myunghun can't master."

There was something Jeon Myunghun had to do by mastering the Yukgeuk Eumraeshin, so it was better to have him learn it in advance. After giving a few more instructions to Hong Beom, I headed towards Cheonin Island.

Swoosh— At that moment, I felt a chilling sensation all over my body again.

'What is it?'

Looking at the sky, the evening glow and the moonlight rising from afar seemed to brighten. As the light brightened, the sensation faded. It was the same feeling I had before meeting Seo Hyul.

'Is Seo Hyul up to something again? Or is it something else...'

I remained vigilant and headed towards Cheonin Island.

* * *

Jijok Jinryongmaeng. Eastern part of Hyeonum. Hyeonum, who had transformed into his true form and was meditating there, opened his eyes wide. A faint blood light emanated from Hyeonum's eyes.

Buzz— Hyeonum seemed to be looking somewhere for a moment. Then, recognizing a signal emanating from a distant place, his eyes narrowed sharply. Fear filled Hyeonum's eyes.

Rustle— Hyeonum, who had transformed from a dragon's body to a human form in an instant, clenched his trembling fists. His hands were already drenched in cold sweat.

"Those ominous beings are fighting each other... It's a good thing. Ha, even if one wins, the other won't be able to exert power for a while... It's a good thing."

He seemed to be forcing himself to imagine a good future, trying to calm his trembling voice to overcome his fear. At that moment, Hyeonum, who seemed to be communicating with somewhere far away, suddenly flinched and looked at the void.

"Wait, what do you mean by that, true body! What do you mean by lying low for a while!? Didn't you say you found traces of the authority!? Wait, don't cut off the contact! True body! Give me some instructions..."

But Hyeonum, who was waving his hand towards the void, stopped moving. After a while, he clenched his fists tightly.

"Damn it...! You said you found traces of the authority, and now you're going to lie low to avoid the fallout...?"

Hyeonum, who seemed to be enraged, suddenly flinched and stepped back as the moonlight entered his eastern part, as if trying to avoid the light. His hands were trembling like aspen leaves. Hyeonum gritted his teeth as if recalling some bad memory.

"...Yes, lying low for a while might be a good idea. Hoo, hoo..."

He hid his body in the darkness and took deep breaths.

* * *

Cheonryeondaesan. At the top, above the white jade pavilion. Baekun Seongsa, surrounded by white light, was looking at the sky with a stunned expression. His trembling hands, Baekun Seongsa took a deep breath and smiled bitterly.

Hyeonum and Baekun Seongsa. And other Seongbangi Seongsas of the middle realm. The true people of the Seonggye. Those who knew the true myth read the celestial signs and trembled in fear, sensing the movements of unimaginably colossal beings.

* * *

After using the Bidun Technique for a while to reach Cheonin Island, I suddenly turned my gaze to just below Cheonin Island.

'There was Taeyeolsa down there.'

I was contemplating whether to join the Taesuhui and see her, but I decided to visit Taeyeolsa first.

'It's better to spar with her, receive the teachings of Eojeon Ilbo, stabilize my realm, and then be properly recognized as Taesu, right?'

Anyway, my celestial realm had been reduced due to blocking Seo Hyul's self-destruction, so my celestial realm was at the mid-level of the Cheonin stage. It wouldn't be bad to reach the great circle of the Cheonin stage with the new Cheonin stage formula I obtained from Seorip.

'Now that I'm free from Seo Hyul, I finally understand.'

Yang Sujin said that if you bless a bond, you receive the blessing of the strongest Jongmyeongja, but why did I not know until now, and why did the blessing of 'Cheonwon's formula' reveal itself through Seorip's body?

The reason was simple. The strongest Jongmyeongja blessed 'Seoeunhyun,' not 'Seo Hyul.' At that time, Seorip was in a much less eroded state by Seo Hyul than I was, and when he obtained the formula, he hadn't fully differentiated into Seorip and still recognized himself as 'Seoeunhyun,' so he could obtain the formula.

Everything was because of Seo Hyul.

'Thinking about it like this makes me angry again.'

But it doesn't matter. Seo Hyul must be furious too, having lost the Obokchuk because of me.

I arrived at the valley where Taeyeolsa was. Out of respect for her, I decided to land at the entrance of the valley and walk instead of entering Taeyeolsa directly. I also retracted my consciousness domain into my body, thinking it might be unpleasant for her if I scanned the area with it.

As I walked through the valley, I felt something strange.

'...Why is the Taenghwa Road... gone?'

Previously, Taeyeoljeon had painted Taenghwa all over the valley. But now, the valley looked clean. I felt a sense of oddity as I walked through the valley. And when I arrived at the place where Taeyeolsa was, I felt a chill down my spine.

Taeyeolsa existed. But it looked completely neglected, old, and partially collapsed. Thorn bushes were growing everywhere, and the main gate of Taeyeolsa was on the verge of collapsing. It looked like a haunted house.

'What, what is this...'

Unable to hide my bewilderment, I entered Taeyeolsa. The main hall, Taeyeoljeon, was on the verge of collapsing due to lack of maintenance, and trash was scattered everywhere. I entered Taeyeoljeon. The main hall where prayers were offered was all rotten, and the roof had collapsed due to lack of maintenance. The room where she had served tea to me and Kim Yeon was completely collapsed and in ruins. The artistic Taenghwa that had filled the place was nowhere to be found.

At that moment, I suddenly sensed someone's presence from somewhere. As I exited Taeyeoljeon, I heard someone yawning from inside the living quarters. I quickly walked towards the living quarters. Upon closer inspection, it seemed that the living quarters were somewhat maintained, and there were signs of someone living there.

"...Is anyone there?"

Before entering the living quarters, I called out towards the presence I felt inside. Bang! The door of the living quarters opened. Flinch! A woman with jet-black hair was scratching her belly and rubbing her eyes inside the living quarters. Her hair was disheveled, and she seemed to have not washed for quite some time, as there was a strange smell emanating from her. Judging by the energy of the Wonyeong I felt from her, she seemed to be at the mid-level of the Wonyeong stage.

"Um, who are you?"

She looked at me with a sullen face and then flinched. "Oh, you're a senior. Ahem, ahem. I'm embarrassed to show my junior's shabby appearance."

She seemed to gauge my realm, and upon sensing my celestial energy at the Cheonin stage, she hurriedly tidied her disheveled hair and roughly straightened her clothes.

"Uh, please come inside... No, this room is a bit... I'll take you to the guest room."

She moved in a flustered manner, guiding me to the adjacent room of the living quarters. I looked at her face with a stern expression. Glancing at the room she came out of, I saw a huge mess. It was the complete opposite of the neat place where Taeyeoljeon had stayed. Even the guest room she was guiding me to seemed quite messy, as I could hear the sound of her cleaning it for a while. After a while, she invited me inside.

"Se, senior. Everything is ready. Please come in."

I entered, observing her face closely with a stern expression. She lowered her eyes in fear upon seeing my expression. Normally, I would have been considerate of a lower-level practitioner, but I wasn't in the mood for that now. I sat down and looked around.

"...Aren't you going to serve tea?"

"Ye, yes? Ah... Forgive me, senior. The tea that master used to brew... It all rotted away about 500 years ago due to lack of maintenance..."

"...There are no Taenghwa paintings in the room."

"Ah... I'm sorry. I didn't receive the transmission from master... Ah... No, come to think of it, I think I did receive it... But I forgot because I never practiced it... Haha."

"..."

I looked at the woman who had the same face as Taeyeoljeon with a stern expression. She had the same face but was completely different in every other aspect.

"What is your name?"

"Ye, yes? Ah... I don't have a name. I was abandoned at this Taeyeolsa when I was young, and master, the abbot of Taeyeolsa, picked me up and raised me. He didn't give me a Dharma name, telling me to find my parents when I reached the Wonyeong stage... But when I saw the revolving lantern after reaching the Wonyeong stage, I found out that my parents didn't give me a name and abandoned me... Haha... Master used to call me 'rascal,' 'dirty one,' or 'lazy one'..."

"..."

"Uh... Senior, you can call me whatever you like."

She scratched her head awkwardly. I couldn't relax my stern expression, and she shrank even more upon seeing my face.

"Take this move."

Buzz— I took out the Chongcheon Sword and launched an attack at her, targeting the level of the soul. However, she didn't even recognize the Chongcheon Sword and just stared blankly at me. Swoosh— The sword strike passed through her without any resistance. If she had been Taeyeoljeon, she would have joyfully countered the strike. But this woman didn't even recognize it.

"...What are you?"

I glared at her and asked. Was the reason
