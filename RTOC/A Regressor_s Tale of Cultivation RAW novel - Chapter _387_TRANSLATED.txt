### Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 387: Salt (3)

"Jeon Myeonghun!!!"

When I entered the house, I saw Jeon Myeonghun sitting in the main hall. He was holding a knife, and his clothes were torn in several places, covered with self-inflicted wounds.

"......"

I scanned the inner room of Jeon Myeonghun's house. From inside, I heard faint sounds. Rushing over and opening the door, I found Geum Sohae and his children lying unconscious. It seemed Jeon Myeonghun had knocked them out. I closed the door and looked at Jeon Myeonghun.

"…Have you come to your senses?"

"…Seo Eunhyun."

"......"

Jeon Myeonghun looked up at me with empty eyes.

"Kill me."

"…Don't talk nonsense."

"…I just want to think of it as a nightmare. After all… it's an illusion… right? Even if I die here… I'll wake up again. Isn't that right?"

"......"

"If you don't kill me… what am I supposed to do?"

"......"

"Here! Sohae is alive…!"

Jeon Myeonghun clung to me in a small voice. Despite his desperate cries, he was clearly worried that Geum Sohae and the children might wake up.

"Sohae is alive. So, what should I do? It's so vivid. Eunhyun, it's not just Sohae's hand. Her breath, her gaze, her personality, her skin… everything is the same. The same! So, I have no choice but to stay here. If I become the king here, this illusion will break, won't it? I can't bear to see this illusion break with my own eyes. Just kill me."

"......"

"I know. I know this world is an illusion. And I know that the disciples of Geumshinchunraemun in the lower realm believe in me. I understand it clearly! I know I have to wake up someday! Because… I have to take revenge! On Cheonbeol! On Cheonbeol!"

He couldn't even string his words together properly, clinging to me.

"So! I can't stay here! But! With my own eyes! I can't bear to see this world break! Please, Eunhyun. Kill me. Even if you kill me… it's an illusion… I'll come back to life again. Right? Right? Eunhyun…"

Smack!

I slapped Jeon Myeonghun's cheek.

"I lost too!!!"

At my words, Jeon Myeonghun shut his mouth.

"I said I lost too!!! Don't whine like you're the only madman!"

Jeon Myeonghun seemed to think I was referring to Hong Suryoung. But it wasn't just Hong Suryoung. Buk Hyanghwa. Kim Yeon… How I feel about them, honestly, after regressing several times, seeing them with the same faces but completely different inside, how do I feel each time? Does this guy know? Does he know how it feels to have my memories and time completely erased, not knowing who to blame or what to seek revenge on? Does he know the feeling of shouting emptily at the sky because I can't identify the entity causing the regression? There's the same Geum Sohae in front of you? You're afraid of waking up from the dream?

"I lost too! Don't rely on me!"

I grabbed Jeon Myeonghun by the collar and shouted. I too! There's the same Buk Hyanghwa! The same Kim Yeon! In front of me! After dying several times, regressing as if waking up from a dream, does he know the feeling of my time disappearing like a dream?

"Stand up! You bastard! It's time for us to move! Stop talking nonsense! [This time too]! [If you don't want to lose more]! Follow my words!!!"

Drip, drip…

Jeon Myeonghun bit his lip. Bright red blood flowed down his chin. I grabbed Jeon Myeonghun by the collar and dragged him outside the house.

The comrades began to regain their memories. Yuk Rin was plotting something, some kind of crazy plan. In the sky, though invisible within this formation, the fate of calamity was bestowed upon me. In this high-level world, I am destined to be unhappy. So, I must overcome it by any means necessary. I cannot let go of anything in my hands. There is no next chance. I must always be faithful to what I have at this moment.

Yeon Wi and Jeon Myeonghun, who were highly recognized in the Muguk Cult and Geumshinchunraemun, stood up. I headed towards the prison I had built in the back mountain of Taeul Village. It was a prison where I subdued the yokai with my sword and used their power to suppress and imprison countless warriors and humans who attacked Taeul Village. And naturally, many of my old comrades were imprisoned there. From their perspective, I was the Yokai King and the greatest demon in the world, so they wouldn't cooperate with me, hence they were imprisoned. The yokai, lacking reason, obeyed the logic of power, but those with reason couldn't be helped.

I arrived in front of the prison where Oh Hyunseok, who had connections with another faction besides the Muguk Cult, was imprisoned. Oh Hyunseok had already broken the chains and bent the iron bars of the cell, coming out.

"Are you out, brother?"

"Yes, I've come to my senses."

Crack, crack…

For some reason, Yoo Hyunseok, though in human form, seemed to be treated like a yokai in this world. Despite being human, he possessed the power of a yokai. Perhaps it was because I had taught him the 'Changryeongseonggwangochadae Method's' 'Jijokpan.'

'If that's the case, I don't know why I'm just a charcoal burner.'

The rules of this world were a bundle of contradictions that couldn't be understood even with Yuk Rin's explanation, so I couldn't understand them.

"…Are you okay, brother?"

"Honestly… not really. It's unpleasant."

"......"

"On Earth… my wife had a miscarriage. Here, I became the father of that child, and to not be ashamed of my wife and children, I set out to subdue the Yokai King."

"......"

"Knowing it's an illusion… really, really makes me angry."

"......"

"Anyway, let's go. It seems everyone is waking up… Didn't you say we need to conquer some capital and become the king?"

"…Yes."

I nodded and set out with Oh Hyunseok, Jeon Myeonghun, Yeon Wi, and others. Unfortunately, Kim Younghoon, Kim Yeon, and Buk Hyanghwa couldn't come to their senses. It might be because, besides the Muguk Cult, there weren't many who cherished them. Kim Yeon had Gwaegun, but Gwaegun's forces were all puppets except for Gwaegun himself, and it was unclear if Gwaegun cherished Kim Yeon.

Anyway, I had the Jiangshi yokai, Wi Shihon, and the water ghost yokai, Eum Wa, capture and bring Buk Hyanghwa and Kim Yeon. I had other yokai bring the captured Kim Younghoon and Yuk Rin. The two were dragged along in resignation, and I shouted while placing Jeon Myeonghun, Yeon Wi, Oh Hyunseok, and Seoran on Shiho's back.

"Let's go! To the capital!"

Before Yuk Rin could pull any crazy stunts!

Thus, I led dozens of yokai troops towards the capital.

* * *

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

In the distance, the capital came into view. The capital of Bongrae Kingdom was built around a massive mountain. And that mountain was the salt mountain we saw when we first entered Bongrae Island. That salt mountain was probably the center of this formation.

I looked up at the peak of the salt mountain. As we saw when we first entered Bongrae Island, there was a palace made of pure white salt at the top of the salt mountain. Up there lived Yuk Rin's mother, the queen of Bongrae Kingdom.

As we crossed the walls of the capital, thunder and lightning rumbled from the top of the salt mountain, and the guardian dragons protecting the royal family of Bongrae Kingdom appeared.

"Climb up!"

At my command, the yokai ignored the dragons' roars and sprinted up the salt mountain. The dragons began to spew flames from their mouths.

"Graaaaaa!!!"

From Oh Hyunseok's body, treated as a humanoid yokai, a purple aura seemed to ripple, and he extended his fist.

Boom!

The punch from Oh Hyunseok's fist neutralized the dragons' flames, and as the dragons showed signs of confusion, I commanded Shiho.

"Jump!"

Thud-

Shiho stepped on a peak of the salt mountain and leaped into the air. I stepped on Shiho's body, feeling the pressure of the atmosphere, and kicked off from Shiho's body.

Whoosh!

Combining the force of Shiho pushing me and the force of my kick, I soared incredibly high. In an instant, I reached the guardian dragon's face and climbed up by grabbing its whiskers. The dragon struggled, but I never let go of its body and wielded my sword.

Swish! Slash!

After becoming the Yokai King, the sword I had made by a master blacksmith pierced through the dragon's scales. The dragon's scales were hard, but my understanding of the sword was more solid than the dragon's scales. I performed a sword dance on the dragon's body.

Slash, slash, slash!

Wounds appeared all over the dragon's body, and it howled in pain. There were three guardian dragons of the Bongrae Kingdom's royal family. I subdued one in an instant. In the distance, Shiho and Oh Hyunseok subdued another one simultaneously, and numerous other yokai used swarm tactics to subdue the last one.

"Don't kill them! We're entering the palace!"

I quickly headed towards the center of the palace on Shiho's back. As I passed by a library filled with countless scriptures, I glanced at it.

'Now is not the time to covet that.'

At the center of the palace, numerous officials were trembling but waiting for us. And at the center, a woman who looked similar to Yuk Rin was sitting on the throne with what seemed to be a jade seal.

I spoke dryly.

"I want the throne. Please lend it to me for a moment."

She sighed expressionlessly.

"…Is it you again? The dreamers."

"I have many questions, but I'm in a hurry, so please lend me the crown and the jade seal quickly."

But she shook her head.

"That can't be…"

I furrowed my brows but soon understood. From behind her throne, Jin Mayeol and Yuk Rin walked out. Jin Mayeol smirked and spoke.

"Sorry, but…"

Without saying a word, I drew the emergency sword at my waist and threw it at Jin Mayeol. The sword pierced Jin Mayeol's forehead, killing him instantly. I looked at Yuk Rin, whose face had hardened, and spoke.

"Don't pull any tricks, Yuk Rin. Even if you get the throne, nothing will change. I possess the power of a combined force at the Great Circle level, and our sect's demon kings, conquest fleet, and numerous forces above the combined force level are with us. If you surrender and reveal your plans, I promise to return Jeongryongdo and Wijeonghaeyuk to you and reinstate you as the palace lord."

Yuk Rin looked at the dead Jin Mayeol and spoke in a slightly trembling voice.

"Actually… I don't know what you're talking about."

"…What?"

"I'm just a prince of the Dragon Kingdom, allied with Bongrae Kingdom… I don't understand what's happening…"

"......"

I frowned deeply. The intention was genuine. The queen sighed and spoke to me.

"You seem like a filial dreamer…"

"…?"

"Ah… no? Anyway, you seem to respect your elders… Congratulations. It seems your forces have won."

She placed her crown and jade seal down, pointing at them.

"Take them. I know you always want these."

She stood up from the throne and spoke.

"Sit down. Quickly sit here and find what you're looking for in our land, then leave. According to my daughter, you seem trustworthy… Please don't tear my heart apart like the previous letter."

At her words, the officials in the palace trembled and wailed, looking at the yokai.

"Your Majesty!!!"

"How can you hand over the ancestral temple and the state of Bongrae to the Yokai King!"

"Your Majesty!!!"

They wailed purely, knowing nothing. Amidst the wailing, with Yuk Rin at a loss, the queen offering the throne with a resigned expression, and my comrades behind me, I felt confused. But I approached with a stern face and reached for the crown and jade seal. It was a race against time now.

Thus, I wore the crown of Bongrae Kingdom, held the jade seal, and sat on the throne of Bongrae Kingdom. The queen of Bongrae Kingdom, looking annoyed, shouted.

"From now on, the king of Bongrae Kingdom is here…"

And then, Yuk Rin's voice echoed in my mind.
