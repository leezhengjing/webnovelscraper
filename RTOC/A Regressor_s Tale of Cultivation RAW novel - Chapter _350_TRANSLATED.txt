### Demonic Sect (2)

The world turned pure white. Inside it, Cha Jogwi experienced a terrifying sensation as if even his screams were being disintegrated.

‘This... domain...! It's being torn apart!’

He gritted his teeth and shrank his domain.

‘If even my domain is destroyed, it's truly the end... I'll die...!’

Gritting his teeth, he decisively abandoned and retrieved fragments of his domain. To the demonic creatures within the domain of Yin, the power of the Blessing Gate of Righteousness was supremely effective.

‘As expected...! It was indeed a corrupted old monster eroded by a true immortal...!’

Despite the excruciating pain that felt like his entire body was being cooked, Cha Jogwi contracted his domain to prevent his own annihilation and moved forward to protect his subordinates from being purified.

‘To have such a dark death aura, to have mastered such ferocious demonic arts, and yet to wield such a righteous technique? I've never heard of such a thing. It's impossible...!’

A being with 19 heads, an incarnation of dense death. It was almost impossible for such an incarnation of demonic arts to also master a righteous technique. There was only one possible explanation: this was a power that had been 'infused.' It was a power obtained by being eroded by a great true immortal!

“Graaahhh!”

Even as his entire body was being cooked, he stood his ground in front of Seop Myeongham. The white flash that seemed like it would last forever finally faded.

“...”

Chi-iiing—

Cha Jogwi looked around, seeing the black smoke rising from his entire body. He no longer felt the 'gaze' from above.

‘Is it... night now?’

But it was strange. Despite it being night, or rather, despite being in the Netherworld, the surroundings were too 'bright.'

‘A blue... sky?’

Most demonic creatures were not born in the Netherworld. The majority came from the lower world after wandering the Nine Heavens upon death. As such, they remembered what a 'blue sky' looked like. Cha Jogwi looked up at the 'blue sky' with a dumbfounded expression. The surroundings were dyed blue due to the white light emanating from the sky. And the surroundings had turned into a desert.

‘Ah... I see.’

Cha Jogwi slumped to the ground, understanding the situation.

‘Due to the power of the Demonic Sect Leader, the area near Baek Eumyeok has turned into a desert. And the sky has brightened and turned blue due to the eerie power of that righteous technique...’

Thud!

He looked behind him. The great ship that had been floating in the sky, Seop Myeongham, was now buried in the sandy desert, no longer emitting demonic energy.

‘It seems the power was concentrated on the shield, causing the power source to momentarily discharge.’

In the midst of this, Cha Jogwi noticed a large 'shadow' in front of him.

‘Ah...’

No, it wasn't a shadow. It was a 'pit.' A blue sky. An endlessly stretching desert. In the center, an indescribably large pit had formed. Cha Jogwi trembled. That 'pit' was where 'Baek Eumyeok' had been just moments ago. It was the place the Demonic Sect Leader had covered with a spherical barrier using his technique. Cha Jogwi looked up at the sky with trembling eyes. The sky had turned blue due to the light emanating from above. So what was the source of that light? It was 'Baek Eumyeok.' Baek Eumyeok was emitting light made of blessings, floating in the sky and dyeing it blue.

“Formation activation, connection to the spiritual land complete.”

“Dragon veins condensed, floating formation operating normally.”

“Formation charging 120%. Ready to activate at any time.”

Wuuuuung—

I sat on the throne, manipulating the spiritual energy, looking down at Hong Beom, who was fiddling with the spiritual land in front of me, Kim Yeon, who was commanding the formation from the side, and the formation masters gathered from all over the Wuguk Sect.

Wuuuuung—

At the center of Baek Eumyeok, the headquarters of the Wuguk Sect. In the center of the Wuguk Sect, the Wuguk Hall. I sat in the underground of the hall, surveying the entire Baek Eumyeok with my vast consciousness. The formation installed over the years moved the dragon veins of Baek Eumyeok, lifting it into the sky. Like the Celestial Sky of the human realm. And like the Ascension Hall of Deungseonhyang. I had envisioned this plan inspired by the Ascension Hall of Deungseonhyang. The Ascension Hall created by Yang Sujin was influenced by the spiritual power of Deungseonhyang. It was intertwined with Deungseonhyang itself and its spiritual power. I intertwined the entire Baek Eumyeok with the spiritual land and dragon veins, just like Deungseonhyang. Now, this land would become the holy ground of the Wuguk Sect.

Rumble, rumble!

I, the leader of the Wuguk Hall, reached out into the void from the center of all formations. Rumble! The spiritual power moved. The floating formation that lifted the entire area used only the power of the dragon veins. The power created by absorbing the attacks of the combined demonic kings with the Great Demonic Sea Star had not yet been used. So how should that power be used? This was just the beginning.

Crackle, crackle!

Jeon Myeonghun, standing beside me, crossed his arms with a delighted expression, sparks of red lightning crackling around him.

“Is it time to go now?”

It was time to go rescue the disciples of the Golden God Thunder Sect.

* * *

Rumble, rumble!

Cha Jogwi's expression changed.

‘This crazy Demonic Sect Leader. What on earth is he trying to do?’

He had suffered fatal injuries from his domain being torn apart. Even if the Demonic Sect Leader tried something, there was nothing he could do. As he looked at the Baek Eumyeok floating in the sky with a pale face, a chilling sound echoed, and he saw space being torn apart. And from inside, 'it' emerged.

Crackle, crackle!

It was a giant god, emitting red and black lightning from its entire body. The giant god with six arms, carrying six shadows on its back, tore through space and locked eyes with Cha Jogwi.

“What, what! Who are you?”

Though he looked flustered, the giant god of red lightning ignored Cha Jogwi and cast its gaze behind him. Rumble! The giant god reached out towards Seop Myeongham behind Cha Jogwi. Cha Jogwi realized the giant god's intention.

‘Damn! It's after Baeklin!’

“Baeklin! Run!”

As soon as his voice burst out, a white light erupted from Seop Myeongham, forming a giant skeletal figure. Crackle! In the next moment, the six-armed giant, the Six Extreme Ghost King Jeon Myeonghun, turned into lightning in an instant. Crackle! Before the fatally injured Cha Jogwi could do anything, Jeon Myeonghun became red lightning, covering the sky and earth. He became a giant net. Crackle! The net made of red lightning spread out as if to cover the sky. The original spirits of Baeklin, shattered into thousands of pieces, screamed in agony. Cha Jogwi, lifting his fatally injured body, shook Jeon Myeonghun's net with his faint spiritual power.

“You...! You demonic sect scum! Let go of my friend!”

Crackle!

“Graaahhh!”

Cha Jogwi was eventually struck by the red lightning and flung far away. It was then.

“Damn it, let go of me!”

“Captain!”

“Please spare us!”

Cha Jogwi saw several demonic creatures caught in Jeon Myeonghun's net. While trying to capture the shattered Baeklin, Jeon Myeonghun's net had inadvertently caught other demonic creatures as well. Among them were Cha Jogwi's lieutenant, Yoo Hye, and several other crew members. Cha Jogwi shouted with eyes blazing.

“You scum! Demonic sect scum! Release my comrades at once!”

Crackle!

Jeon Myeonghun pulled the net in front of the spatial rift he had emerged from. The Celestial Sky emitted a strange wave, slowly moving forward. Yoo Hye, gritting her teeth, created a small gap in Jeon Myeonghun's net. Crackle!

“Yoo Hye! Get out of there!”

Cha Jogwi shouted. But Yoo Hye threw the other crew members out first. The net was gradually being pulled into the spatial rift along with Jeon Myeonghun. 

“Yoo Hye!”

Cha Jogwi, his body trembling from the blessing and lightning, flew up. Finally, Yoo Hye managed to free the last crew member from Jeon Myeonghun's net. And finally, Jeon Myeonghun, dragging Yoo Hye and the shattered Baeklin, entered the spatial rift. Yoo Hye looked at Cha Jogwi and smiled.

“Captain, it was an honor to serve you.”

Chi-iiing—

And Jeon Myeonghun closed the spatial rift. Cha Jogwi, emitting light madly from the sky, flew towards the moving Celestial Sky. The Celestial Sky was emitting a white blessing, but he didn't care. Cha Jogwi's body was burning.

“Yoo Hye!!! No!!!”

Wuuuuung—

But the Celestial Sky was gradually accelerating. Moving at a snail's pace, it seemed to speed up tenfold with each breath.

Wiiiiiing—

Crackle!

As Cha Jogwi finally reached out towards the light curtain emanating from the Celestial Sky, it emitted a tremendous light and disappeared in an instant.

“...”

Cha Jogwi stared blankly at the gradually darkening void. He felt the space fold. Yes, it was a teleportation technique. Not just any simple teleportation technique. It was an incredible distance that even a combined demonic king couldn't cover in one go. A teleportation technique that leaped tens of thousands of miles in one go. Cha Jogwi trembled with a despondent expression.

“Yoo Hye... Baeklin...”

His lieutenant and lover, captured by the demonic sect. And his old friend, Baeklin.

“Hraaahhh!!!”

Under the sky of the Netherworld, which was gradually returning to its original state, Cha Jogwi screamed madly.

* * *

Wiiiiiing—

I could feel it. The entire Baek Eumyeok was leaping through countless spaces and times. It felt more like a spatial transmission than a teleportation technique.

Rumble, rumble!

I laughed, feeling the immense pressure of space and time indirectly. The Destruction Teleportation Formation. It was a formation developed by Hong Beom, me, and Kim Yeon, who had received formation knowledge from Yeonwi, through the Destruction Sky Formation that exploded space via the spiritual land. The Destruction Sky Formation fundamentally 'distorts space' to explode. And the teleportation technique of the demonic kings temporarily crushes and folds space to run. Hong Beom came up with the idea to combine the two. The Destruction Sky Formation was a crystallization of malice created by humans. After unfolding that crystallization of malice, I assimilated it with my curse. Then, using the White Orchid Ascension Gate, I reversed the crystallization of malice along with the curse. This turned the Destruction Sky Formation from a formation meant for destruction into one with a different purpose. Hong Beom changed the purpose of the reversed Destruction Sky Formation to a formation for 'teleportation.' By absorbing the power from the battle with the combined demonic kings using the Great Demonic Sea Star, and injecting it into the crystallization of malice, the formation was charged. Then, by reversing the Destruction Sky Formation, assimilated with my curse, it was transformed into the Destruction Teleportation Formation. And with that, the immense power of the Destruction Sky Formation was instantly converted into a teleportation technique, allowing us to move distances that would normally be impossible to traverse.

Flash!

Rumble, rumble!

Finally, we reached the first destination of the long yet short Destruction Teleportation Formation.

‘Six more steps to go.’

The Destruction Teleportation Formation was designed to perform a total of seven teleportations. Moving such an immense distance in one go was impossible, so we had to create a gap to cool down the formation's overload after each teleportation.

“First destination reached. We have moved 200,000 miles from the original location of Baek Eumyeok.”

“One day later.”

I looked around the entire Baek Eumyeok. The formations laid out everywhere. And the countless disciples of Baek Eumyeok remaining. The disciples were connected to the dragon veins of Baek Eumyeok, assisting the formation.

‘Excellent.’

I smiled, satisfied with the sight. Those who were meant to leave had left, and those who remained had become even more loyal disciples of the sect. As I was feeling satisfied, Jeon Myeonghun approached with a pleased expression, holding a skeletal creature in one hand.

“Seo Eunhyun. No... Sect Leader. We have captured the one we missed last time.”

I laughed heartily. Baeklin flinched but spoke in a resigned voice.

“Do as you wish, you demonic sect scum...”

Jeon Myeonghun nodded. Then, scratching his head, he spoke.

“Um, actually... the problem is, besides the original target, we accidentally captured another one.”

At Jeon Myeonghun's gesture, a ghost in a white shroud, bound tightly by lightning ropes, was dragged before the throne.

“One of the demonic creatures on Seop Myeongham was accidentally captured as well. What should we do with this one?”

I looked at the ghost in the white shroud with gleaming eyes. The ghost glared at me, biting her lip.

“Kill me...! You demonic sect scum!”
