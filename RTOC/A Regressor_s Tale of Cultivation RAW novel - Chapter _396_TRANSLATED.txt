**Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 396: Drinking It Down (6)**

Boom! A massive sword light shone brightly, intercepting the Zhenglong Blade. From the opposite side, a golden sword light gleamed, slicing through the Zhenglong Blade. It was a combined attack from me and Kim Younghoon.

'That took a while.'

There was a reason it took so long for us to strike the Zhenglong Blade. First, there was betrayal. Both Kim Younghoon and I knew the true nature of Jin Mayeol. We knew he was someone who would stab us in the back given the chance, so we had to find a way to restrain him. To prevent Jin Mayeol from betraying us, I had to retrieve 'Hyeongoji,' who originally mediated the contract between Yuklin and us, and slowly send him up to Bongraedo. This was a highly difficult task as it required elevating material to the level of the soul through the Total Heaven Sword, which took quite a bit of time.

Secondly, even if we managed to rescue Baeklin, we had to figure out how to bring him to Bongraedo. If Yuklin tried to recapture Baeklin, we would have no answer, so we had to bring him back to Bongraedo quickly before Yuklin could act. Jin Mayeol and Bukhyanghwa, with their extensive experience in the Goryeok Realm, helped with this.

"Let's use the Yeomgolho as an intermediate zone to cross the sea," Bukhyanghwa suggested.

Even though the Yeomgolho could dive deep into the sea, it couldn't dive deep enough to reach Bongraedo. Therefore, the plan was to dive as deep as the Yeomgolho could go and then create an 'intermediate zone' to cross the sea. This required time to modify the Yeomgolho for this purpose, and there were some frictions with the Tumahae Pirates during the process. Jin Mayeol occasionally felt displeased, which extended the modification time. As a result, it took us over 80 years to finally come to rescue Baeklin.

"It's going well. There must be no mistakes in the plan. Yuklin has already gained enough Yeomjeong to master the Yeomhaeguirook, and nearly 100 years have passed since then. His power must be unimaginable," Jin Mayeol's projection said, crossing his arms beside me.

I glared at him. "If you pirates had cooperated earlier, we could have come faster."

"It's strange that you took so much time to save one subordinate. And you modified my ship in such a way, of course, I would feel rebellious."

"You accepted it because it benefited you. Thanks to the modifications by the Conqueror King Bukhyanghwa, your ship's performance has improved nearly tenfold."

"It's still just a lower version of your Bukhyangham."

"Enough talk. It's starting now. You better move properly."

"Who are you to say that?" Jin Mayeol retorted before canceling his projection.

Boom! At the center of Zhenglong Palace, Yuklin, who seemed completely accustomed to the body of Yukwoong, revealed his massive form. Several subordinates of the Sa Chukgi appeared around him.

Buzz— As soon as he appeared, the entire sea of the Goryeok Realm buzzed. The Yeomhaeguirook seemed to have a good affinity with the sea of the Goryeok Realm.

Crackle— 'He's insane….' Kim Younghoon sent a telepathic message from the opposite side, asking if I was okay. But facing Yuklin's true form, I knew.

'One sea of the Goryeok Realm is practically his domain.'

The Celestial Race unfolds the Combined Dao Domain, and the Earth Race assimilates the Combined Dao Domain into their bodies. So what about those who practice both? It was simple. They could do both 'combining' and 'assimilating' simultaneously.

Buzz! Yuklin's body gradually transformed, resembling the blue sea. His mane became waves, and his scales turned into waves. Buzz— Moreover, the entire Weijeong Sea buzzed around Yuklin. I broke into a cold sweat. Now, he could practically make the entire Weijeong Sea his domain, in addition to his assimilated domain. Therefore, he was essentially a master of the Celestial-Earth Combined Technique.

'Almost comparable to my true form…!' It wasn't just at the level of the Three-Tai Chi; I would have to bring out the entire Celestial-Earth Heart Demon. But I smiled.

"That's quite terrifying."

Whoosh! Ignoring whatever he was saying, I launched another strike of the Seated Meditation with the Total Heaven Sword. Crack! Although a transparent scar appeared on Yuklin's body, it quickly healed. He laughed in a booming voice, his eyes shining like the moon.

"Indeed, you seem to have mastered the Yeomhaeguirook quite well. But aren't you mistaken about one thing?"

I smirked. "If I had reached the Combined Stage, I wouldn't engage in a fight I couldn't win."

"Enough with the chatter."

I took my stance and launched another strike of the Seated Meditation at Yuklin with the Total Heaven Sword. He was wounded again but merely snorted. Now, such wounds seemed as insignificant as a headless wound to a decision-making machine; he looked perfectly fine.

"Ah… that's true."

I smiled and moved around Yuklin, drawing his attention. It was amusing. Just 80 years ago, I was the one facing Yuklin head-on while Kim Younghoon distracted him with speed. But now, I was the one distracting him, focusing on dispersing his attention. The reason was simple.

Boom! Kim Younghoon, who had been concentrating behind me, opened his eyes. Kim Younghoon, who had been in communion with the realization of Jangik, had been given the opportunity to commune for over 80 years, confined to a narrow space. Imagine that—80 years of embedding the realization of Jangik into Kim Younghoon.

Rumble! The sea vibrated. The realization of Jangik, the realization of my Great Sea Star, and the realization of the Celestial and Earthly Forces, shared with the Sa Chukgi subordinates, were all integrated into his weapon. The light of the entire Weijeong Sea seemed to converge into a small sword for a moment. It wasn't an illusion. In that brief moment, the Celestial and Earthly Qi of the entire Weijeong Sea was sucked into that small sword.

The sword, named Neunggwang (凌光), was one with the man holding it. He was Neunggwang, and Neunggwang was him. For a moment, I saw the illusion of a golden phoenix crying out behind Yuklin. White salt crystal-like Qi particles bloomed around Yuklin. He seemed to transform from a blue dragon to a white dragon in an instant. The white dragon Yuklin glared at Kim Younghoon and opened his mouth. A dragon wave, capable of attacking an entire sea, was compressed and shot out. It was clearly stronger than a hundred years ago! This was the power of a dragon.

But do you know about the Golden-winged Bird (金翅鳥)? This bird is said to create thunder with a single flap of its wings, break the cycle of the world, and devour dragons. The first form of Neunggwang's Opening Form (凌光開闢形), created by Kim Younghoon after witnessing the realization of the Celestial Master.

Neunggwang's Opening Diagram (凌光開闢圖). The first form.

"Golden-winged Light Extinction (金翅衊光)."

The sword, concentrating the light of heaven and earth, was swung. In the next moment, all the light of heaven and earth was cut off. It could only be described that way. For a moment, it felt like the entire world was shrouded in darkness, and nothing could be perceived. When the momentary 'unperceivable world' disappeared, and perception returned, I felt the illusion of a golden flash descending upon the entire world. It was as if golden wings briefly blocked the light and then gently let it shine again.

'Yuklin….' I looked at where Yuklin had been. He was no longer there. I looked at the horizon opposite where Kim Younghoon stood after swinging his sword.

'There he is.'

Yuklin had been flung to the edge of the sea's horizon after being struck by Kim Younghoon's attack. It was hard to believe he had been flung so miserably within his own domain. From the distant Yuklin, an overwhelming sense of humiliation and disgrace emanated.

'More than just humiliation, it was a significant blow.'

If compared to a decision-making machine, it wasn't just a simple body cut but a considerable strain on the core. "Do you understand now, Yuklin?" I smirked. "Our power is already equal to yours."

Whether he heard me or not, I saw his eyes turn white with rage. Although there was some energy consumption, the power of the Heart Demon clone was the same as the true form. Initially, I had planned to join forces with Kim Younghoon if Yuklin, who had mastered the Yeomhaeguirook, was unexpectedly strong. But after seeing the recent exchange, I changed my mind.

Tap! Kim Younghoon passed by me, exchanging glances. Now, Kim Younghoon would face Yuklin alone. I, with a bewildered face, couldn't believe the recent strike and looked at the direction where the Zhenglong Palace Lord had been flung. I pointed the Total Heaven Sword at the subordinates of the Zhenglong Palace.

"I will count to ten. If you surrender within that time, you won't face any harsh consequences."

Several Sa Chukgi subordinates of the Zhenglong Palace flinched and exuded killing intent. It seemed they had no intention of surrendering. Perhaps they judged my clone to be only at the initial stage of the Combined Stage, unlike Kim Younghoon, and thus resisted.

"One, two, ten."

I counted to ten using the method I learned from the Golden God Thunder Sect and swung the Total Heaven Sword.

'Wait, Baeklin.'

We have come to rescue you.

* * *

Step, step….

Yukyo succeeded in bringing Baeklin's head to the depths of the Zhenglong Palace. She was already adorned with numerous sparkling ornaments.

"…What is this? If it were my father's personality, he would have sent a split soul to warn me by now."

However, even after reaching the area she was concerned about, Yuklin showed no sign of stopping her. A sinister smile appeared on Yukyo's face.

"It seems they are fighting well outside. Seeing that my father can't pay attention to me even after I've come this far…."

Buzz— Baeklin's head buzzed.

"Are you worried there might still be some restrictions? Don't worry. My father, with his personality, would guard it himself rather than entrust it to someone else."

Creak— Yukyo confidently opened a door to a secret chamber inside the Zhenglong Palace. In her eyes, she saw a large altar and a spirit tablet with some basic restrictions placed on it.

"My father is confident in his skills and doesn't trust others, so he rarely uses subordinates or restrictions to guard his treasures. Seeing that he only left restrictions that can be unlocked with a bit of effort, it's clear, isn't it?"

Buzz— Buzz—

"What is that?" Yukyo smiled and approached the spirit tablet.

"It's my father's uncle. My great-uncle engraved his 'name' on this Hyeongopa. It was made for his ascension to the Seonggi stage, but unfortunately, he died of some plague before he could ascend."

The spirit tablet had the name 'Yukwoong' engraved in the language of the Yo Clan.

"This is a nameplate proving my great-uncle's existence and, at the same time, a symbol proving his kingship recognized by the Jaehoon Jade Seal. My father is trying to rename this nameplate to transfer the kingship of the Jaehoon Jade Seal to himself and become the true Sea Dragon King."

A thrilling sense of excitement flashed in Yukyo's eyes.

"If I have this… I can finally escape my father's grasp!"

Buzz— Buzz—

She slowly approached the spirit tablet called Hyeongopa. Baeklin's skull buzzed loudly, but as she got closer to the Hyeongopa, her eyes became more and more dazed, as if she were being enchanted. And then, the next moment.

Buzz! Baeklin, trying to transmit a strong message, made Yukyo flinch and hurriedly lower her head.

Boom! She broke into a cold sweat and looked back at what had just grazed her head. There were long claw marks on the wall of the secret chamber. Dark demonic energy was emanating from those claw marks.

Step, step….

Someone walked out of the shadows of the secret chamber. It was Wi Yoon, exuding dark demonic energy, with his eyes half-rolled back. Yukyo gasped in shock.

"My father used someone else to guard the Hyeongopa, which he cherishes as much as his life?"

Wi Yoon, seemingly out of his mind, screamed wildly. The eerie sound, like a ghost's wail, made Yukyo cough up blood from her seven orifices and start activating the stolen ornaments she had taken on her way to the secret chamber.
