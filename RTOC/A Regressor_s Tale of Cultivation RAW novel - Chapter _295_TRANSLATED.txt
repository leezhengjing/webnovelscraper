Avenger (3)

"Kang Minhee?" I asked, a bit surprised. 'Even with Seolip's body, I could only gather information that it was difficult to meet her at Seolip's level, even if I searched for her in Heuksaek Guigol Valley...'

It seemed that the disciples in the Myung-gwi realm knew about Kang Minhee's whereabouts, suggesting that she might be in the Myung-gwi realm.

"Is she in the Myung-gwi realm?"

"No. To be precise, she is on the 'path' leading from the Gwanghan realm to the Myung-gwi realm."

"A passage to the Myung-gwi realm..."

'That's the first I've heard of such a thing.'

The Jinma realm was adjacent to the Gwanghan realm, so there were quite a few passages leading to the Jinma realm. Each major race had at least one or two entrances to the Jinma realm. However, the middle realms like Goryeok, Jagum, and Myung-gwi were quite far apart, making it difficult to have formal passages.

Understanding my confusion, Jeon Myunghoon added an explanation.

"It's a very peculiar passage that only opens through Seopmyeongham. According to the information received by the disciples in the Myung-gwi realm, it's more of a 'shortcut' than a formal passage."

"A shortcut?"

If you pierced a hole in the dimension, that would be the entrance to the dimension. But how could there be a 'shortcut' in a dimension?

'Well, I don't need to know the details. It's not like I'm going to create a shortcut myself.'

"Hmm... So, you're suggesting we use the 'shortcut' through Kang Minhee?"

"Yes. Try contacting Kang Minhee. Wouldn't she listen to an old colleague's request?"

"Why should I contact her? Can't you do it?"

Jeon Myunghoon chuckled at my words.

"I saw the revolving lantern when I reached the Wonyounggi stage. Most of it passed by quickly, so I don't remember everything, but quite a few memories remained clear in my mind."

"...So?"

"Among those memories were the ones from our company days. Kang Minhee really hated me back then."

'Well, the only one who was outwardly close to Jeon Myunghoon in the department was Oh Hyesoo.'

But his next words made me flinch.

"And among those memories, I remember that you and Kang Minhee were the closest during the early days at the company. Even in Deungseonhyang, she often agreed with you. So, wouldn't she listen to you?"

"...I was close with Kang Minhee... Well, we were close during the early days at the company."

"That's why I'm asking you to do it. If I contact her again, she'll probably curse me out."

"..."

'If I contact her, she might not just curse me out but cut off contact immediately.'

But I reconsidered.

'No, it's been almost a hundred years. Would Kang Minhee still feel awkward around me?'

It had been so long that my feelings had faded, but I didn't know how Kang Minhee felt about me, making it awkward to contact her myself. It also felt strange to talk about those times without her permission.

'Since I hold the position of Taesu, if I contact Heuksaek Guigol Valley officially, she might meet me...'

I suddenly wondered if Kang Minhee's feelings towards me had faded or not.

'...Should I try contacting her?'

I pondered whether to contact Kang Minhee after hearing Jeon Myunghoon's persuasion. In the early days at the company, Kang Minhee and I had secretly dated.

* * *

Blink.

I opened my eyes. Both my main body and I shared the same feelings about Kang Minhee.

'What does Kang Minhee think of me now?'

Kang Minhee and I had a peculiar relationship. Initially, we were both new to society, joined the company at the same time, and had a strange longing for 'office romance.' So, after the first company dinner, we started dating with the thought of 'why not give it a try?' And we broke up after three weeks.

We were a terrible match. And as is often the case, we became extremely awkward after that. Being in the same department, even though it was only a three-week relationship, having an ex-boyfriend and ex-girlfriend in the same space was suffocating.

Kang Minhee was bright in public but hard to get close to in private, so she didn't feel much affection for the company. I was the opposite, getting close to Hyunseok hyung and other department members despite Jeon Myunghoon's bullying. So, after a simple and awkward discussion, Kang Minhee decided to resign.

However, before she resigned, a project proposal she wrote out of boredom caught the eye of the SJD Company president. Impressed by the proposal, the president publicly praised her and raised her starting salary by three levels. She was quickly slated for a team leader position, and not wanting to miss the opportunity, she decided to stay, aiming for a department transfer to avoid our awkward relationship.

...Of course, the department transfer failed due to Jeon Myunghoon's schemes.

'I was also growing fond of the company and wasn't sure if I could succeed in my next job, so I decided to stay...'

So, we remained awkward, and Kang Minhee quickly got promoted, starting to openly ignore and dislike me. We clashed on almost everything. Our desks were close, so I used to ask her work-related questions, but at some point, I started going to Hyunseok hyung instead.

Moreover, our relationship was half out of a longing for office romance and half out of excitement after the first company dinner, so we had no real affection for each other. We became like cats and dogs.

'Looking back, I could endure Jeon Myunghoon's bullying not because of my strong mental fortitude but because I was more focused on my suffocating relationship with Kang Minhee.'

Our bad relationship continued, even in Deungseonhyang. She smiled when dealing with me but always stayed away when something needed to be done. On the first day, Oh Hyesoo and Kim Yeon found a place to stay with me, while Kang Minhee went to find tea with others, staying away from me.

"...That's a memory too."

I chuckled as I returned to my lodging. It was a memory from thousands of years ago, from when I was practically a baby. But for Kang Minhee, it was only about a hundred years ago, so I couldn't predict her feelings.

"..."

I leaned against the wall, thinking deeply, and decided to delay direct communication with Kang Minhee through my main body.

'First, I'll gather some information as Seolip.'

If her personality and likes and dislikes were the same as before, she would likely feel the same about me. If there were any changes, her thoughts about me might have changed too.

I went to the next lodging to greet the elders of Heuksaek Guigol Valley.

"Seolip, a junior, greets the elders of Heuksaek Guigol Valley."

"Ah, a polite one, aren't you?"

"Haha, I saw it during the test. In terms of curses, you're much better than those from the Eumhon Gwi clan. It's a blessing to have such talent in Heuksaek Guigol Valley..."

They tried to pat my shoulder, but I subtly avoided it and asked a question.

"By the way, I have a question. As a newcomer, there are many things I don't know. May I ask the seniors?"

The two Eumhon curse masters of Heuksaek Guigol Valley looked puzzled.

"Hmm, didn't you receive a temporary Gwi-ryeo from a Gwi-wang as a new Eumhon disciple?"

"Hey, senior. Didn't you inform the junior about the basics of Heuksaek Guigol Valley?"

They recognized the ratio within their bodies and asked. But it wasn't that I didn't want to ask the ratio. I had asked about Kang Minhee when I had time after receiving the ratio, but the ratio only replied, 'I've heard the name.'

'The ratio is an old soul, so it wasn't interested in recent disciples or the recent operations of Heuksaek Guigol Valley, except for a few incidents...'

"Ah, I see. If it's an old Gwi-wang, that makes sense."

The Eumhon elders, Wihon and Geupun, told me to ask if I had any questions.

"First, who is the current highest leader of Heuksaek Guigol Valley in the Gwanghan realm?"

"Hmm, the highest level is the Sachoogi Daewonman, the Gwi-wang Heuksaek Elder, who is on the verge of reaching the Hapche stage. He passed away 3,000 years ago and is enshrined in the Great Mausoleum. Although he's on the verge of reaching the Hapche stage, he has already abandoned his human body and plans to move to the main sect of the Myung-gwi realm once he reaches the Hapche stage, so he's practically not here..."

"Next are the Heuksaek Elders, Heo-wi and Heo-ryeong, who are in the middle of the Sachoogi stage, and Heo-gwak, who is in the early Sachoogi stage. They are the highest leaders of the sect."

Listening to his explanation, it seemed that Heuksaek Guigol Valley operated under an oligarchic system where multiple Heuksaek Elders made decisions, unlike Geumshinchunraemun or Changcheongaebyeokmun, where one leader made all the decisions.

"I see. Then, who are the middle leaders of the sect?"

"Well, the heads of Eumhon-gak, Gwi-hon-gak, Si-hon-gak, Mun-hon-gak, and Jibmu-gak are under the Heuksaek Elders."

Eumhon-gak managed Seopmyeongham and navigation. Gwi-hon-gak managed the laws and Gwi-wangs, performed rituals for the Myung-gwi realm, and communicated with the main sect of the Myung-gwi realm. Si-hon-gak managed the sect's discipline and laws. Mun-hon-gak managed the entrance and overall administration of the sect. Jibmu-gak assigned and managed tasks and rewards.

"In your opinion, who are the most notable recent disciples of Heuksaek Guigol Valley?"

They thought for a moment before answering.

"Well... If you mean recent arrivals, there's really only one."

"Indeed. Although many outstanding individuals have joined, the most remarkable is that person."

I read the respect in Wihon and Geupun's thoughts.

"The current deputy head of Gwi-hon-gak, the Eumhon Daewonman practitioner, Elder Kang Minhee."

"An extraordinary person. She started cultivation less than a hundred years ago and is already transitioning from Eumhon Daewonman to Sachoogi."

"Less than a hundred years old?"

"Yes. A very promising individual."

I brightened up at the mention of Kang Minhee and asked more about her.

"Impressive... How can one join Eumhon-gak, Gwi-hon-gak, etc.?"

"To join the Five Great Halls, you need merit points. If you accumulate over a thousand merit points, you can choose one of the Five Great Halls to join."

"Or you can become a Eumhon Elder and join as a head of a hall."

'Accumulate merit points or become a Eumhon Elder...'

I decided to quickly accumulate merit points or become a Eumhon Elder. After hearing some stories about Kang Minhee, I returned to my lodging and thought.

'Kang Minhee hasn't changed in a hundred years.'

So, there was a high chance that her awkwardness and discomfort towards me remained.

'Then, I have no choice but to leave it to Jeon Myunghoon.'

* * *

"...You want me to contact Kang Minhee?"

"Yes. As you know, a year and a half before we fell into Deungseonhyang, Kang Minhee and I had a big fight."

"...Ah! That. I heard about it from the manager. You two raised your voices and fought in the office, right?"

"Yes... But why do you know about something that happened during work hours?"

"Hmm, that's not important. Anyway, after I asked my uncle to block Kang Minhee's department transfer, she almost stopped associating with me... And you want me to contact her?"

I sighed at his unresponsiveness.

'Me and Jeon Myunghoon... The worst combination for Kang Minhee.'

Given her personality, if we asked her to let us use the 'shortcut,' she would probably refuse outright. Why would she grant a request from the two people she disliked the most?

'And I don't want to force her to open the shortcut just for a few disciples from Geumshinchunraemun...'

I felt a growing sense of discomfort but ignored it.

"...Well, if that's the case, I'll try asking someone else."

"Who?"

"Kim Yeon."

I stood up and said.

'I was planning to rescue her anyway, but now I have to go a bit earlier. It won't be hard to escape now.'

"Follow me. We're going to meet Gwaegun."
