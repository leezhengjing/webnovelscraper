Farewell (6)

"Follow me."

The prelude to the battle was initiated by Seo Eun-hyeon.

Chuaaaat!

Light. The starlight of all colors seemed to shine from his hand, and then it became a vertical slash that directly struck the sphere.

Kwaaaad!

A scar of starlight remained on the sphere. I cast Guiwanghua. Perhaps because the surroundings were filled with ghostly energy, the 18 heads that Seo Eun-hyeon had destroyed instantly regained their original form.

Daemaksa Haeseong. Sikmagwi Mol.

Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp...!

The 18 heads opened their mouths simultaneously. And from their mouths, an immense suction force began to draw in all the ghostly and yin energy in the vicinity. An overwhelming power surged!

Ooooooo—

From the eyes of the 18 heads, a fierce ghostly fire erupted violently. Simultaneously, the yin energy in the surroundings weakened temporarily, causing the ghostly hordes to retreat. But that was not the end. The next stage of the Yin Soul Ghost Art, a technique passed down from Biyul, who was a master of the Curse Lineage. A technique that could be mastered from the initial stage of the Original Spirit to the peak of the Four Demons Stage.

Black Blood Tears.

Chuaaaaa—

From the 18 skull heads, pitch-black tears fell. The tears scattered on the ground, causing black cursed flowers to bloom on the nearby earth.

'I had already evolved the Yin Soul Ghost Art independently to the point of nearing the Black Blood Tears.'

The cursed flower buds were quite similar to the grotesque masses I had created as the Black Ghost Lord in my 10th life. The ominous feeling they exuded was also quite similar. If I hadn't discovered the White Orchid Sacred Art back then, I would have obtained the Black Blood Tears.

Of course, even though I had come close, the Black Blood Tears were still a masterpiece created over several generations by the Curse Lineage of the Black Ghost Valley. The cursed flower buds I had created as the Black Ghost Lord back then were the 'end,' but the Black Blood Tears were just the 'beginning.'

Kyaaaaa—

Kuaaaaa—

Huaaaaa!!!

The flower buds bloomed. Simultaneously, a scream louder than the wails of the ghostly hordes began to fill the area. The black flowers looked more like the gaping mouths of split snakes, and inside, something resembling eyeballs rolled around.

Usually, blooming one Black Blood Tear flower was classified as 1-star. Blooming three flowers was 2-star. Blooming five flowers was 3-star, corresponding to the initial, middle, and late stages of the Original Spirit respectively. Eight flowers were 4-star, corresponding to the peak of the Original Spirit. Ten flowers were 5-star. Twenty flowers were 6-star. Thirty flowers were 7-star. Blooming fifty flowers to create a flower bed was 8-star, corresponding to the peak of the Celestial Human Stage. After that, blooming a hundred flowers was 9-star, two hundred flowers was 10-star, and three hundred sixty flowers was 11-star, corresponding to the late stage of the Four Demons Stage. Successfully blooming a thousand flowers to create a flower garden was 12-star, signifying mastery.

And around me, countless grotesque flowers bloomed, filling a diameter of 10 li in an instant. The ghastliness of it caused even the ghosts guarding the sphere to flinch and retreat.

Chwararararak!

As I willed it, a yin wind swirled around. In that yin wind, the petals of the cursed flowers scattered. The black cursed petals gathered in front of me, forming a sword.

Booong!

I focused my mind and swung the sword made of cursed petals.

Kwaaaang!

The sword's slash overlaid the starlight slash left by Seo Eun-hyeon. However, the sphere still remained intact, only leaving a mark. But the slash of my cursed sword seeped into the sphere. I could feel it. The sphere was a conglomeration of all kinds of pain, resentment, and sorrow. A massive concentration of the ghosts' grudges. Inside, my cursed petals naturally blended in, like a spy, seeping into the sphere.

Seo Eun-hyeon and I exchanged glances.

Uuuuuung!

The sword marks left by Seo Eun-hyeon began to shine in all colors.

* * *

What is the essence of the Sword of the King?

Seo Eun-hyeon's eyes gleamed. For 500 years, he had been honing himself, reading the essence of the Formless Sword. And he had forged the Formless Sword, which had become immensely powerful due to the Heavenly Tribulation. He realized that the enlightenment was already within him. He awakened the heart of the martial arts he had learned and unified it with himself once more.

Thus, he obtained the Sword of the King.

The essence of the Sword of the King was as follows: By risking the destruction of one's soul, one compresses their mental world into the essence of their martial arts. It was an enlightenment that resonated with Seo Eun-hyeon's understanding of the Formless Sword. If one's heart truly resonated with their martial arts, they would not die even if they entered the essence of their martial arts.

Seo Eun-hyeon had unknowingly been pre-studying the enlightenment of the Sword of the King through the Formless Sword. By risking everything and embedding one's heart and mental image into the essence of their martial arts, if one succeeded in unifying the heart of their martial arts with their own heart, the martial arts they had learned would fully enter the realm of the soul.

In the case of Tae Yeol-jeon, he continued to fight with the power emanating from the source of his mental image within the realm of the soul. In the case of Jang Ik, he gathered an immense amount of qi with the power of his fighting spirit, which had ascended to the realm of the soul, and unleashed it.

Those who reached the Sword of the King could all obtain a strike that reached the realm of the soul. With that strike, they could embed their mental image into their opponent's mental image, or manifest their mental image externally to create a clone. Jang Ik embedded his mental image into the mental images of countless subordinates in the Sacred Realm, supporting them with a strike, and in emergencies, he created clones through the embedded mental images. Kim Young-hoon also created clones that were identical to his main body in everything except the total amount of power, using the same principle.

The Sword of the King corresponded to the stages from the Four Demons Stage to the Union Stage of the Celestial Race. Why? Because the 'strike' of the Sword of the King, into which the Celestial Race poured their 'everything,' was powerful enough to even cut through dimensions, comparable to the full-force strike of a Union Stage master.

However, the strike of the Sword of the King required pouring in 'everything.' After unleashing a 'strike' by compressing their mental image once, the Celestial Race often ended up in a near-death state. Since their martial arts heart and their own heart had unified, their overall skills increased, but the main technique of those who reached the Sword of the King was the 'strike imbued with their mental image.' Once used, their combat power would be exhausted, making it a gamble-like, mutual destruction strike. Therefore, those in the early stages of the Sword of the King were treated as being in the Four Demons Stage.

However, as they became more familiar with the attacks of the Sword of the King, more skilled, and their understanding of the mental image deepened, the number of times they could unleash the 'strike imbued with their mental image' increased. Their skills gradually improved, allowing them to draw out the power of the mental image to the extreme. And as this happened, the strike, which was initially a mutual destruction move, increased to two strikes, then three strikes. As their understanding of the mental image deepened, at some point, the Celestial Race could unleash the 'strike imbued with their mental image' in rapid succession.

Therefore, those who reached the later stages of the Sword of the King, skillfully handling the power of the mental image and unleashing the strike in rapid succession, were recognized as full-fledged Union Stage masters. And the reason why the Celestial Race often ended up in a near-death state after unleashing the strike was because they were handling a power that their fragile bodies could not withstand.

In other words...

Chuaaaat!

"Second strike."

Seo Eun-hyeon, who possessed the body of a Four Demons Stage master, would not end up in a near-death state just by unleashing one or two strikes imbued with his mental image. In an instant, Seo Eun-hyeon's body seemed to be enveloped in sharp energy, and he swung his sword.

Kwaaaad!

Once again, a scar of light was engraved on the sphere.

"Third strike."

Flash!

Once again.

"Fourth strike."

Once again.

Seo Eun-hyeon's strikes landed, landed, and landed, embedding a total of seven scars into the sphere.

"Hoo..."

Seo Eun-hyeon wiped his sweat. The light embedded in the sphere grew even brighter. It was a light visible only to Seo Eun-hyeon, who was of the Celestial Race, and Seo Rip, who shared his vision. And likewise, it was visible to Gwi-gun, who also shared the vision of the Celestial Race.

That light was both a sword mark and Seo Eun-hyeon's clones.

"Now, Seo Rip!"

Seo Eun-hyeon shouted. Seo Rip formed a hand seal. And then.

Flash!

The black petals that had seeped into the sphere instantly turned into white petals.

Boom!

A massive radiance surged from the top of the sphere, creating a large hole. Simultaneously, the seven sword marks merged into one and penetrated deep into the sphere.

"Let's go!"

Booooong—

Seo Eun-hyeon and Seo Rip entered the sphere, followed by a massive horde of puppets. How far did the two follow Seo Eun-hyeon's slash? In front of their eyes. Far away, they saw Seop Myeong-ham.

"The space is distorted."

Seo Eun-hyeon muttered as he ran through the space inside the sphere, which was larger than it appeared from the outside.

Booooong!

The horde of puppets clung to Seop Myeong-ham, trying to pull him out. However, Seop Myeong-ham did not budge, as if he were anchored in place. Below Seop Myeong-ham, pitch-black ghosts gathered like water, holding onto him. Seo Rip roared with ghostly fire, but the ghosts, though trembling in fear, did not retreat. Seo Eun-hyeon also stared at the ghosts calmly. The ghosts seemed to fear Seo Eun-hyeon even more than Seo Rip, but they still did not move.

Seo Eun-hyeon clicked his tongue and spoke.

"We need to pull him out. I'll handle Seop Myeong-ham, you follow the light."

Seo Eun-hyeon pointed somewhere to Seo Rip. There, the combined slash of the seven strikes he had unleashed was piercing through the darkness beyond Seop Myeong-ham, continuing forward.

"From my perspective, her mental image was deep in the center. The main body of Kang Min-hee is probably there. Go, Seo Rip."

Seo Rip looked at Seo Eun-hyeon.

"What is it?"

Seo Eun-hyeon smiled gently at those words.

"Until recently, you called me the main body, but now you need me to tell you."

His tone was somewhat reproachful. However, his expression was filled with joy.

"You know you originated from me."

Seo Eun-hyeon turned his back on Seo Rip.

Kugugugugu—

The starlight of the Changryeong Seonggwang Ochae Dae-beop, transformed by Seo Hyul, began to shine from Seo Eun-hyeon's entire body. His body gradually grew larger, like a giant.

Seo Eun-hyeon became a giant who embraced a starry night within his body. Seo Rip saw in that figure the memory of a giant. No, the memory of Seo Eun-hyeon overlapped with the figure of a giant.

Kudududuk!

The giant of stars began to tear Seop Myeong-ham, who was anchored by the ghosts, from the ground.

"Cha, it's Changhoja!"

"He came to rescue us from the Changcheon Gaebyeokmun!"

A few disciples of the Black Ghost Valley, who remained with Seop Myeong-ham, cheered as they saw the giant of stars. Seo Rip looked at the giant's back with a dazed expression. Seo Rip remained silent. Then he turned his back and followed Seo Eun-hyeon's slash.

'I'm just following.'

Behind him, the disciples of the Black Ghost Valley cheered, but as they exited and faced the strange fortress, they screamed. Seo Eun-hyeon would probably follow him soon. He would overtake him again. No, the slashes of Seo Eun-hyeon, burning the darkness ahead, were already like Seo Eun-hyeon's clones, so he was already ahead.

'I'm just looking at your back.'

Seo Rip gritted his teeth as he ran after Seo Eun-hyeon. He had already acknowledged that they had separated. He didn't know what would happen with the regression, but they were already different people. And Seo Eun-hyeon respected Seo Rip, always pushing him to be independent. However, Seo Rip felt a sense of frustration in one corner of his heart. He didn't know why.

How long did he run along the dark path?

Paaaat!

Seo Eun-hyeon's slash exhausted its power and dissipated, and Seo Rip finally reached the end of the path. There, a massive ghostly figure in the form of an eight-foot demon was curled up, sleeping.
