The stone building where the Tu nobles resided. Inside, Xian Gui sat on a bed, his gaze directed somewhere. 

"Did you obtain the favor of the pet Tu nobles?" 

His gaze seemed mocking, yet there was a hint of pity in his eyes. 

"How pitiful to strive for something so obvious. It's almost sad. There's no act more meaningless than that struggle..." 

Clicking his tongue, Xian Gui turned his empty gaze away and lay down on the bed, closing his eyes. Perhaps lying down and closing his eyes was more important than the strange events happening far away.

* * *

I stopped analyzing the sword formation after a while. 

'Enough, I'll study it later.' 

It was meaningless to continue. After dismantling the sword formation, I stepped outside the stone building. Shortly after, the investigators from the Heilin Eoreum Sect also came out. 

"It seems everyone is gathered. Let's head to the next area. Our human race was once a pet species raised in the Zhulong Zhenren's Twilight Island, so we might find something more suitable for us there." 

I transformed into the Ghost King again, blocking the surrounding heat, and asked. Xian Gui kindly explained in response to my question. 

"Yes. According to the legend, during the war with the True Demon Realm, many species living in the Central Realm sought refuge in the Zhulong Zhenren's Twilight Island. Zhulong Zhenren accepted them, and this is the Water Flow Layer." 

'Then shouldn't they be called protected species rather than pet species?' 

Xian Gui strangely kept referring to them as 'raised' or 'pets,' but from the explanation, it seemed more like an 'ark' concept. It felt like they were accepted to protect the species during the war with the True Demon Realm. 

'...Is it just a difference in interpretation between Xian Gui and me?' 

I tilted my head slightly but decided to let it go for now. We arrived at another basin. This basin also had stone buildings similar to the previous one, collapsed in the center. According to Xian Gui, this basin was mostly a 'lake' in the past. Now it had dried up and turned into a basin, but it seemed that the stone buildings were all actually water houses in the past. 

We entered the basin and arrived at the stone buildings. 

"These are the buildings where the human race stayed. Since there are things we couldn't obtain last time, let's search thoroughly again." 

We scattered again to search the stone buildings. While searching the stone buildings used by the human race, I found a small jade box under a bed. It was quite dull and had a subtle concealment spell, making it hard to find without a clear consciousness above the Sacrifice Stage. 

'What could be in this jade box to warrant such a high-level concealment spell...?' 

However, the jade box contained a method to project an image using the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy. Following the method, I moved the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy to create an image, and I was astonished. The jade box was a kind of erotic painting. It seemed to be a cherished item of the room's owner. I respectfully turned the jade box into powder to honor the owner. 

At that moment, a new image appeared as the erotic painting disappeared. It was an image of a small, thin man. 

"First, thank you for destroying this jade box. I had set it to turn into powder upon my death, but if there was an error in the setting... thinking that this jade box would be passed down to future generations, I would die of shame again even after dying once." 

The owner's words continued. 

"The outside is currently engulfed in war. Honestly, with such terrifying individuals exerting their power, a mere Sacrifice Stage remnant like me should just stay here under the protection of the Zhenren. But even so, I had nothing to do, so I indulged in the contents of the jade box. Anyway, as a token of gratitude for destroying the jade box... I will show you my life in this room. If you want to see the records I left behind, feel free to do so." 

The image spread widely throughout the room, becoming an illusionary spell that covered the entire room thinly. I watched the illusion with keen eyes. The daily life of the thin man unfolded in the illusion. Despite his words about frequently viewing erotic paintings, the man was not actually handling them. Instead, he mostly walked around the room with a focused expression or wrote books. 

I observed the books he was writing from behind. Since the books would have weathered away by now, it was better to see them through the illusionary spell. The title of the book the man was writing was 'On Immortal Arts.' I watched him write and read 'On Immortal Arts.' The book was literally about the concept of 'Immortal Arts (仙術).' 

"A low-level cultivator uses hand seals and incantations to perform spells. As the cultivator's level increases, their spells manifest through their intent and consciousness. From the Celestial Stage and above, the consciousness merges with the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy itself, and the boundaries of spells disappear. Therefore, they often research specialized powers to create and use 'True Name Divine Abilities.' The magic of the demon races is similar to spells, except that it relies on the potential of the physical body and the essential understanding of spiritual energy instead of hand seals and incantations. So, how do high-level investigators' spells differ from ours?" 

"I once directly observed a battle between a fallen judge and a Zhenren. If you ask how I survived, I didn't. I had to die and be resurrected due to the overwhelming impact of the battle. But in return, I had the opportunity to understand what Immortal Arts (仙術) are, which was an invaluable experience." 

'Immortal Arts?' 

Although we call the path we walk the path of Immortal Cultivation (修仙), the reason we are called 'cultivators' rather than 'immortal cultivators' is simple. The character for 'immortal (仙)' cannot be used lightly. The ultimate realm that all cultivators yearn for is the realm of immortality (仙). And as such, techniques or concepts with the character 'immortal (仙)' attached to them are particularly powerful or great. So, what exactly does the Immortal Arts of a true immortal refer to? 

I continued reading with curiosity. 

"Immortal Arts are the power to influence fate. Not the trivial power handled by mere Sacrifice Stage cultivators. It refers to the true power that reaches the level of the Name Stage. In other words, if one can achieve feats such as altering fate or steering the course of history in a different direction, that is called Immortal Arts." 

'Oh, in that case....' 

I thought of my Mie Shen Ge Tian. The Mie Shen Ge Tian created by Yang Shuzhen was, in itself, a type of Immortal Arts. And then, I was startled. 

'Wait, if the power to influence fate and history is called Immortal Arts....' 

The Mysterious Fortress. The Lotus of Fate. Isn't that also Immortal Arts (仙術)? According to this book, Guijun succeeded in creating Immortal Arts, which belong to the realm of immortals, with his mortal body. 

'It's more believable that there are eight Fate Masters.' 

In fact, I wondered if Guijun also came from Earth. His talent was so extraordinary that it made me think so. I understood why the Black Dragon King had such a violent reaction when he sensed the Lotus of Fate in the previous cycle. 

'Immortal Arts, the Black Dragon King sensed the presence of Immortal Arts and came. He probably thought that if there was someone using Immortal Arts in the Central Realm, it would be a Zhenren or at least a Celestial Stage cultivator....' 

While I was marveling at Guijun, a strange thought occurred to me. 

'Wait, if the power to change fate is Immortal Arts... then isn't the path of Immortal Cultivation (修仙) itself Immortal Arts?' 

Ultimately, a cultivator is a being who defies the heavens. Changing one's fate is the essence of Immortal Cultivation. Unfortunately, this book did not delve into that. Instead, the man seemed to be describing his feelings when he directly observed Immortal Arts and its terrifying nature. 

At that moment, the man, who was writing the book, closed his eyes and seemed to recall the scene when he saw Immortal Arts. 

Right then. 

"Huff, huff... Gurgle, gurgle!" 

The man suddenly twisted his body grotesquely, rolled his eyes back, and began scribbling madly on the paper. No, it was more like 'scrawling.' 

At the same time, the illusionary spell, which had been clear until now, began to shake violently. It was as if capturing this scene with a mere illusion was blasphemous. 

'What is that...?' 

As I watched the distorted illusion, the man, whose eyes had rolled back, suddenly started tearing and eating the book he had written. 

'What?' 

He devoured the book as if it were a delicious meal, even licking his fingers. After a while, the man seemed to regain his senses and looked around in shock. 

As the scrawled content disappeared, the illusionary spell stabilized again. The surroundings had become a mess due to the man's rampage. The man muttered. 

"Th-that was... a revelation? Yes, it was a revelation. Hahaha... When the Zhulong Zhenren dies, I will become his resurrection vessel? He will resurrect within me?" 

He seemed terrified, his face pale. 

"No, no. This being is not the Zhulong Zhenren. Then who is it? Who are you? What kind of being are you... No, no...! This is more, more, more, more enormous than Zhulong or a fallen judge...." 

He grabbed his head and suddenly raised his hand to stab his own abdomen. 

Splat! 

Bright red blood splattered. And I saw something like a 'stone' fall from his dantian area. 

At the same time, the illusion became extremely unstable, centered around the 'stone.' 

"How long! How long will it keep coming out! Stop, stop coming out! Haaaaa!" 

The man screamed in terror and seemed to be casting some kind of spell. The illusion was so distorted that it was hard to tell, but I saw the man using a sealing spell to seal the 'stone.' 

After the sealing spell was cast, the man's illusion returned to normal. However, the thin man did not return to normal. Originally, he was writing books or lost in thought, but at some point, he started crouching in a corner of the bed, making erotic paintings as if to escape from something. 

And after a while, the man hid the jade boxes containing the erotic paintings under the bed or around the room and left somewhere. 

After some time, all the jade boxes except the one under the bed turned to powder. The man had died. The illusionary spell in the room operated for a long time after that and then turned off. 

I paid my respects to the unknown man. At the same time, I remembered the man's words. 

"He will resurrect within me?" 

He said it was more enormous than the Zhulong Zhenren, so at the very least, it was a true immortal. 

'In that case... was a true immortal resurrecting within him?' 

I broke into a cold sweat at the thought. 

'It was the same symptom as the Qingwenling!' 

Falling into madness, writing strange things, eating the written book, and then spewing out a bizarre stone. It was very similar to the symptoms described by Kim Younghoon for the Qingwenling. 

Moreover, since he was at the Sacrifice Stage, unlike the strange stone found in the Qingwenling's body, it seemed like he was spewing out actual stones. 

'In that case, through the current Qingwenling, is a true immortal resurrecting in the Water Realm?' 

"Huff, huff...." 

Thinking about him, I naturally reverted from the Ghost King transformation and felt cold sweat running down my back. 

'Damn....' 

I had thought about saving the Qingwenling. But thinking that a true immortal was resurrecting through the Qingwenling made me lose the will to return to him and the Water Realm. 

I sat in the room for a long time, unable to get up. 

'Why am I so... cautious...!' 

Even if it's just a thought, if I decide to save my former master, what's the harm! 

I suddenly hated myself for such thoughts and gritted my teeth. 

With a sigh, I stood up. 

'...I need to find out what that strange stone is.' 

Thinking about the illusion I saw earlier, I searched for the place where he had sealed the strange stone. It was the ceiling. 

'Come to think of it, this ceiling....' 

I hadn't noticed before, but I felt a strange magnetic force flowing through the ceiling. No, it was more like a magnetic field. Magnets were discreetly attached to the ceiling like constellations. 

By interpreting the flow and arrangement of the magnetic force from the magnets attached to the ceiling, it was possible to decipher and release the seal. And I realized that this method was similar to how Xian Gui read the magnetic force of the sky to interpret the formation. 

'It seems to be an ancient method often used.' 

Perhaps Xian Gui had obtained an ancient secret manual or something. The seal was designed to be unbreakable unless one was at least at the Sacrifice Stage. It made sense since the seal required magnetic force to be released. 

Clank— 

When I moved the magnetic force to release the latch of the seal, the ceiling rippled like water. I floated up to the ceiling and reached inside. I could grab something like a box inside the ceiling. 

I extended my consciousness to scan around the box, but there was nothing else. When I pulled out the box, the ceiling returned to its original state. 

The box was a luxurious ebony wooden box, with dozens of talismans drawn in blood attached to it, forming a barrier around the box itself. 

'The barrier has decayed.' 

Tap, tap— 

When I tapped a few talismans, they turned to powder and scattered. The barrier must have been effective in the past, but now, after so much time had passed, it had long lost its function. 

After removing the talismans, I opened the box. 

"Hmm?" 

However, there was no stone inside the box. Instead, there was a faint liquid. The liquid, which seemed like 'water,' had a mysterious aura. But when I tried to observe it with my consciousness, it was just ordinary water. 

Feeling somewhat dazed, I reached out to the water as if entranced. When my hand touched the water, I felt a sharp sting in my mind. 

"Ouch!" 

I snapped back to my senses, feeling a sharp pain in my mind. My mind felt clearer. 

'What was that? Just now?' 

It felt like I had been in a trance. And after thinking for a moment, I remembered what that feeling was. 

'Ah, I see. That feeling....' 

Cold sweat ran down my back. The feeling just now was similar to when I had seen [something] in the Water Realm and fell into a dream. 

However, if the [something] I saw in the Water Realm was a lethal dose of poison, this liquid was like a trace amount of radiation, not even enough to be harmful. 

'It felt like I was momentarily entranced... but I could block it if I focused my consciousness....' 

While touching the liquid, I investigated its nature. And I discovered that the liquid originally contained much more poison and impurities. It was only safe now because all the poison had dissipated over time. 

Sizzle, sizzle.... 

While touching the liquid, I succeeded in reading some knowledge from it. Surprisingly, this liquid was a kind of 'incantation.' 

"Qinglin Armor?" 

The incantation was for controlling a treasure called 'Qinglin Armor.' 

Sizzle— 

As I absorbed the incantation, the liquid evaporated and disappeared. However, there was no information about the Qinglin Armor itself, and there was no armor-like treasure in the list shown by the Heilin Eoreum Sect earlier. 

And now, there was nothing left in this room. 

"Hmm...." 

I took one last look around the room and then left the building. While I was spending time in the room, the people from the Heilin Eoreum Sect had come out and were organizing the things they had obtained. There seemed to be many elixirs. 

However, I wasn't interested in elixirs. I was looking for treasures or manuals. But there didn't seem to be anything related to the Qinglin Armor incantation I had obtained. 

"Senior, did you find anything?" 

"Hmm, it doesn't seem like it." 

"Understood. Then let's set off again." 

We set off again. We defeated the fire spirits that attacked us from time to time, collected fire marrow liquid, and occasionally picked fire fruits, which were fruits that grew in the fire, gaining small profits. But we didn't encounter any more stone buildings. 

According to Xian Gui, there were only two stone buildings on the path to the second floor, one belonging to the Tu nobles and the other to the human race. 

After a while, we arrived at the entrance to the second floor. 

Clank, clank— 

It was a strange sight. The entrance to the second floor was filled with thick fog and steam. In other words, there was 'moisture.' 

Sizzle— 

I clicked my tongue as I looked at the 'chains made of water' spewing steam madly. The end of the Water Flow Layer, made of a river of flames. It was as if it had been cut off, with nothing but endless void beyond. And above the void, there were chains made of water, constantly evaporating due to the flames. 

But the chains made of water didn't disappear despite being covered in flames, only spewing steam. 

"Indeed, the divine abilities of a Celestial Stage Zhenren are amazing...." 

As I clicked my tongue, Xian Gui laughed heartily. 

"Everyone reacts like that the first time they see it. We'll go up first, so watch how we do it." 

The people from the Heilin Eoreum Sect stood in front of me and began to draw their bloodline power. Scales appeared on their skin, and they transformed into half-human, half-dragon forms before jumping into the burning chains. 

Sizzle— 

It looked extremely hot, but they cooled the heat with their yin energy as they swam up the chains. 

"Interesting method...." 

I tried to manipulate the magnetic force. As expected, I couldn't use the magnetic force or the flying technique, so I had to use such a troublesome method. 

"Swim up the chains while cooling them with yin energy...." 

Buzz— 

I transformed into the Ghost King again. Yin energy spread around me. Frost formed everywhere, and I revealed
