Farewell (3)

“…!”

The moment I heard that name, I felt my body freeze. Yu Hodeok! A true immortal, likely connected to the True Demon Realm or the Blood Sound Realm! Perhaps even related to the Profound Sound, this colossal being appeared before my eyes. With a trembling voice, I asked, “Why have you called me?”

However, Yu Hodeok’s response was unexpected.

“Pardon?”

The shadow gestured for me to sit under the Melia tree. Somehow, I felt that the shadow was smiling. It wasn’t a sinister smile like that of the Profound Sound or the madness-filled smile of Gwaegun, nor was it the masked smile of Seohyeol. It was a genuinely clear smile. That’s the feeling I got from it.

I knelt before him. I could have sat cross-legged or comfortably, but I felt the need to show respect to the being before me. It wasn’t about whether he was a great being or not; it was a matter of principle. His character naturally made me kneel.

“What do you wish to discuss?”

I asked, still not understanding. “I understand you are a being beyond a true immortal. You seem to have consciousness… why do you not resurrect?”

“…?”

It was hard to comprehend. Yet, in a way, it made sense. 

Tears streamed down my face without me realizing it. Why? I felt an endless envy towards Yu Hodeok, who rejoiced in annihilation.

“…Who is ‘he’?”

“…I won’t ask.”

I erased the question from my mind, feeling fear.

“…It’s a beautiful place. Where is this?”

I asked instead, looking down at the flower field spread under the Melia tree.

“If it’s the domain of the Celestial Lord…”

“…Thank you.”

Yu Hodeok, who had eased my worries about getting entangled with a colossal being, conversed with me. I explained my entire life to him, excluding the matter of my regression. I told him about various events that had happened. After listening to my story from beginning to end, Yu Hodeok leaned against the Melia tree and laughed.

“It’s a life with many shortcomings. You haven’t achieved anything, changed anything, or accomplished anything.”

“….”

For some reason, I felt like crying at those words. In front of Yu Hodeok, I felt like a child. It felt as if my life had been acknowledged. However, I did not cry.

“…Since my life is still ahead of me, I’ll postpone the tears for later.”

“Wouldn’t it be when you’re certain you can end your life?”

“Well.”

I smiled bitterly. “I still have too much life left.”

Yu Hodeok nodded.

“Then, I’ll be going.”

Although he had asked to talk, in reality, aside from a few initial questions, it was more like he had listened to my life story. I hadn’t revealed my regression or that I was a terminal being, but just talking about it made me feel relieved. Perhaps this was the mercy granted to me for repenting my sins.

Yu Hodeok extended his hand as I stood up.

“Are you extinguishing the karmic fire for me?”

Buzz!

He reached out into the air. Simultaneously, the entire flower field rippled.

Flash!

And then, the shadow of Yu Hodeok, who had reached into the air, began to shake and soon cracked all over as if it would disappear.

“Are you alright?”

Swoosh—

When he withdrew his hand from the air, he was holding a ball of light. ‘No, this is… a flower?’

Upon closer inspection, it wasn’t light but a ‘flower.’ It was just so bright that I mistook it for a ball of light.

“This, this is….”

“…Thank you.”

I expressed my deep gratitude to Yu Hodeok. He waved at me with a clear smile. After bowing to him, I turned around.

Swoosh—

Then, the surrounding flower field disappeared, and I found myself back at the lakeside of the Melia tree in the Fengyang layer.

‘…Wait, didn’t he say he would give me two gifts?’

At that moment, I saw a scoop of lake water rise before my eyes.

Splash!

The rising lake water poured over me, enveloping me like a solid barrier protecting my entire body.

‘Ah, I see.’

Yu Hodeok had used some power to give me a piece of the Azure Scale Armor. As soon as the cold water of the Azure Scale Armor touched my body, I felt a sense of reality returning.

Flash!

Crackle!

“…!”

Once again, I felt the flames of the karmic fire scorching my soul. But I didn’t care and turned around. Seohyeol was still writhing in pain. It seemed that even for Seohyeol, the pain of the karmic fire was not easy to bear. No, perhaps it was even more painful because it was Seohyeol.

“Does it hurt, Seohyeol?”

“…You don’t seem to be in pain?”

He forced a smile, manipulating his facial muscles, and asked back. I sneered at him.

“It feels like I’m going to die.”

“So, the karmic fire is painful for you as well.”

“Something like that. Now then, shall we continue what we were doing?”

“Alright.”

Seohyeol smiled faintly, enduring the groans, and spoke.

“The [woman] I saw… was wearing white clothes and holding a jade ornament.”

“…What?”

Was it because of the pain from the karmic fire? Or was it because the person was so unexpected? I couldn’t help but be momentarily shocked. Seohyeol’s description pointed to someone I knew very well. Bukhyanghwa. It was definitely her.

‘Why is she in my Manxiang Yinyuan Dao…?’

But then I flinched. Seohyeol’s reptilian eyes were staring straight at me. A bright smile, unlike any I had seen before, spread across Seohyeol’s face.

“As expected….”

“…!”

“She seems to be someone precious to you, Seo Dou.”

Slash!

Seohyeol’s arm moved, bringing the eye engraved on his arm towards me.

“You, you bastard…!”

Buzz—

But before I could continue, Seohyeol’s brainwashing wave hit me. Empowered by the pain of the karmic fire, I knelt on the spot, struck by his brainwashing wave.

* * *

Seohyeol smiled with satisfaction.

‘I’ve discovered the weakness of the second-grade dangerous entity, Seo Eunhyun.’

Just as Seo Eunhyun had injected a truth serum into Seohyeol’s brain to make it easier to read his thoughts, Seohyeol had used the pain of the karmic fire to induce a reaction from Seo Eunhyun. When faced with this pain, even someone with exceptional mental strength would inevitably show a gap.

Seo Eunhyun thought he had been poisoned, but he had underestimated the demonic arts of the Blood Sound Realm. For Seohyeol, who could move by grinding his life force, it was easy to act regardless of poison. However, the problem now was his situation.

‘I can’t connect to the Tak Hon Man Cheon.’

The only Seohyeols he could communicate with now were the ten Seohyeols he had absorbed using the Blood Sound Ghost Incantation, separated by the Tak Hon Man Cheon’s precepts to deal with Seo Eunhyun. Even those few Seohyeols had been consumed by using the brainwashing wave, leaving only about seven.

Seohyeol quickly exchanged opinions.

—We can’t connect to the Tak Hon Man Cheon.

—The second-grade dangerous entity has implanted the power of the Heart Clan, making the connection impossible.

—If I consume a few more of myself, can I overcome it?

—It’s possible. But what about the second problem, the karmic fire?

—Right, if I connect to the Tak Hon Man Cheon with the karmic fire attached….

—I might be annihilated by the karmic fire. It’s better if only the ‘me’ here is destroyed. Even the innocent □□ might be at risk of annihilation.

—It’s not just a risk; there’s a high probability that □□ will be affected as well.

After exchanging opinions, the Seohyeols finally reached a conclusion.

—First, escape from here and deliver the information to the nearest ‘me’ by signal or voice, not through the Tak Hon Man Cheon. That’s the best solution at this point.

Creak—

Seohyeol, who was poisoned by Hongbeom, moved his body through demonic arts and jumped through the hole Seo Eunhyun had made, smiling.

Behind him, the Ghost King, Seorip, with eighteen heads, was chasing him, howling with all eighteen heads.

“You’re quite disgusting, Seo Dou.”

Seohyeol smiled faintly and extended his hand.

Magic. Great Sea Thousand Miles. Water Density Three Hundred Million.

Swoosh!

A massive water prison enveloped Seorip, and the weight of the water became immensely heavy. However, the curse soon blackened the water, and Seohyeol’s magic, which had turned into ink droplets, exploded in the air.

Swoosh!

It was like a rain of ink. Seohyeol, almost at the Water Flow Layer, formed a water seal again.

Magic. Melting Moon Dragon.

A massive sea dragon-shaped water enveloped him.

Splash!

Hongbeom, who had approached Seohyeol, swung his claws. As the black poison touched the seawater, it turned into a spray, scattering illusions. However, as the curse and poison spread, Seohyeol’s body began to rot.

Thud!

Seohyeol forced his decaying body to move and ran towards the entrance of the Water Flow Layer.

‘I’m almost there. Just a little more.’

Magic. Dragon Flow River.

Swoosh!

A dragon-shaped stream was summoned beneath Seohyeol’s feet. He rode the stream across the Water Flow Layer.

‘There it is!’

And then, Seohyeol felt an overwhelming sense of foreboding engulf his entire body.

‘What is this?’

It was ominous. The body Seohyeol was currently inhabiting was that of a Celestial Clan member, the Black Scale Fish Spirit. This meant he could see celestial energy, and Seohyeol’s future foresight showed immense misfortune along with Seo Eunhyun chasing him from behind.

‘Has the second-grade dangerous entity already regained consciousness?’

* * *

Throb, throb….

I shook off the remnants of Seohyeol’s brainwashing wave. My head throbbed. But despite being struck by Seohyeol’s attack, a smile didn’t leave my lips.

“Seohyeol, you really are… a tree that gives without holding back.”

The information entity Seohyeol had left behind when he attacked me earlier. I had been struggling to interpret it, but after being hit by Seohyeol’s brainwashing wave, the influence allowed me to fully interpret the information entity he had left behind. The information entity was something Seohyeol had left in my mind after seeing ‘something’ in my Manxiang Yinyuan Dao and suffering a fatal injury from his head turning to salt.

After seeing ‘something,’ Seohyeol couldn’t handle the poison and left it in my head. But instead, I was able to interpret and accept the information entity. The poison of the information had been weakened through the filter of Seohyeol. Of course, it felt degraded compared to the original. It was a degraded version through Seohyeol.

However, even though it was a degraded version, the side effect of turning to salt upon recognition was gone, making it more suitable for me. The name of the technique I had longed for was Taesan Yeolje Gong (Great Mountain Splitting Emperor Technique).

Seohyeol had left this technique in my head and couldn’t obtain it himself!

Buzz—

I moved my qi according to the operation described in the technique. My hands were imbued with attraction force.

Flash!

Boom!

I became a streak of light, piercing through the floor of the Fengyang layer and the Dogeo layer, landing in the Water Flow Layer. I saw Seohyeol fleeing in the distance. Somehow, I felt a salty taste in my mouth. No, actual salt was sprouting from my arms. Although it wasn’t as severe as when I saw [that] in the Water Realm or when Seohyeol saw [something] in the Manxiang Yinyuan Dao, the degraded Taesan Yeolje Gong also turned parts of my body into salt. But this was manageable, not life-threatening, and could be regenerated.

“Seorip!”

Seorip, sensing my intention even before I spoke, was already beside me. Seorip possessed my body. In my left hand, Seorip activated the Yin Soul Ghost Incantation. In my right hand, I activated the White Orchid Blessing Incantation.

Swoosh!

Hongbeom, in his true form, quickly crawled under me, lifting me up, and began chasing Seohyeol.

Buzz—

With black and white forces rising from my hands, I chanted a spell.

“Hoohoo… hoohoohoo…!”

A house of the Five Elements of Yin and Yang formed around Seohyeol. Simultaneously, Seohyeol extended his arm towards me. I could feel it.

Buzz!

Seohyeol seemed to be using his brainwashing wave, consuming his personality to neutralize the Taesan Yeolje Gong. And for some reason, the Taesan Yeolje Gong felt ‘neutralized’ upon contact with his brainwashing wave.

* * *

Countless questions flashed through Seohyeol’s mind.

‘How? Why? How did he suddenly gain the power of the mountain god…?’

‘I must neutralize it. If I don’t, I’ll die.’

‘If I can somehow deliver the second-grade dangerous entity’s weakness to the Tak Hon Man Cheon, it’s my victory.’

‘The Taesan Yeolje Gong primarily affects consciousness and soul. If I sacrifice my personality as an offering, it will decompose the personality instead of me.’

‘Release the personality to neutralize it.’

Buzz!

Seohyeol released the remaining six brainwashing waves. All six personalities scattered, neutralizing the Taesan Yeolje Gong. But Seohyeol clicked his tongue.

‘This isn’t enough.’

He could feel the madness and determination of the second-grade dangerous entity, Seo Eunhyun. He was concentrating his power, determined to capture Seohyeol at all costs!

But Seohyeol laughed.

“This is truly terrifying. But, Seo Dou.”

He could see Seo Eunhyun chasing him from behind. Due to the hasty possession, Seo Eunhyun hadn’t fully retracted all eighteen heads, creating a bizarre sight of him riding a giant centipede while chasing Seohyeol. But instead of trembling in fear, Seohyeol smiled faintly.

“Shouldn’t you also care a little about your subordinate?”

Stop!

At that moment, Hongbeom, who was carrying Seo Eunhyun, came to a sudden halt. ‘Although it hasn’t been long since they met, and the array hasn’t fully taken over his mind….’

According to his calculations, it should buy him at least half a daengyeong of time!

Crunch!

Taking advantage of Hongbeom’s pause, Seohyeol broke the house of the Five Elements of Yin and Yang and escaped the range of the Taesan Yeolje Gong’s attack. However, a sinister voice came from behind.

‘Huh?’

Seohyeol’s eyes twitched.

‘What? The brainwashing didn’t work?’

Hongbeom had only paused for about a second, unaffected, and continued chasing Seohyeol with Seo Eunhyun on his back. Seohyeol couldn’t help but be a little flustered.

‘No, the brainwashing that affected his mind has ‘moved somewhere.’’

It felt like pouring water into a bottomless pit. Seohyeol tried to communicate with his mental array embedded in Hongbeom’s mind. But he felt an unknown abyss and immediately cut off the connection, giving up.

‘It doesn’t matter. I’m getting out now!’

Thud!

Seohyeol used all his strength to leap out, finally reaching the outside of the Jeomuldo. He arrived at the Hwan Sang Jinbeop.

Flash!

Using the Flying Escape Technique, Seohyeol leaped into the sky, aiming to escape the Hwan Sang Jinbeop. And then it happened.

Crunch!

Seo Eunhyun, with nineteen heads, grabbed Seohyeol’s leg.

“Where do you think you’re going, Seohyeol? Don’t we have some unfinished business?”

“You’re quite persistent, Seo Dou.”

Seohyeol smiled faintly and, without hesitation, cut off his lower body.

Slash!

Wriggle, wriggle!

The heads of the Ghost King, Seorip, crawled out, opening their mouths to grab Seohyeol. But Seohyeol was a bit faster by a fraction of a second.

Flash!

Finally, Seohyeol succeeded in completely escaping from Jeomuldo.

Splash!

Emerging from the heavens, Seohyeol took a deep breath and hurriedly began drawing a spell circle on the ground with his blood.

‘I can’t connect directly to the Tak Hon Man Cheon. It’s impossible due to the second-grade dangerous entity’s Heart Clan technique and the karmic fire. Before Seo Eunhyun catches up, I need to signal or voice the information….’

Stop.

Seohyeol paused while drawing the spell circle. The Sato region was an endless desert. At night, darkness filled the sky, but during the day, light shone down on the entire land. There could be no shadows anywhere. However, for some reason, Seohyeol felt that it was dark around him.

Seohyeol looked up at the sky with a blank expression, feeling an overwhelming sense of misfortune captured by the senses of the Celestial Clan body.

A strange fortress was floating in the sky. An all-too-familiar voice came from the strange fortress.

“…Ha, haha. Gwae Noya.”

With a stiff face, Seohyeol forced a smile and spoke.

“Can I make a quick call to someone?”

Seohyeol gritted his teeth and frantically began completing the spell circle.

‘To the Tak Hon Man Cheon, to the Tak Hon Man Cheon! I need to register Seo Eunhyun’s weakness!’

And then, from within the strange fortress, a clicking sound was heard, and one of the massive cannons attached to the fortress aimed at Seohyeol.

“Wait, Noya. Wait…!”

A massive light filled the heavens and the earth.

“Ah….”

Seohyeol let out a hollow laugh.

“I need to… inform the weakness….”

With the voice of Gwaegun as his last, Seohyeol, who had discovered Seo Eunhyun’s weakness, closed his eyes.
