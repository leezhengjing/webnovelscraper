‘Hmm, a second personality…’ It felt like I had become a mental patient, but upon reflection, I realized I already was one, so I accepted it. Although I seemed sane, I had actually lost my mind during the first Seven Star Ritual and only returned because I went mad again. I had been insane for a long time.

‘Separation of personalities…’ When I fell asleep earlier, I was clearly disconnected from Seorip, but now I could feel it. I felt that Seorip and I were connected again. ‘If my personality truly splits… that wouldn’t be so bad.’

Feeling the connection with Seorip, I sensed that if I died, Seorip would regress with me. Since our souls were still one, it wouldn’t separate from me. If that happened, we could better endure the loneliness of regression. Seorip wasn’t particularly scary. I didn’t think Seorip had the ability to take over my body, and even if that ability developed, Seorip valued me enough to inform me of any changes in personality. There was no information that wasn’t shared between Seorip and me; we were one body. In other words, I was prepared to let Seorip take over my body if it came to that. After all, Seorip was just another part of me.

‘Well, fine. Let’s set that aside for now…’ I composed myself. 

Creak— Yeon-i brought tea inside the small house. “Oppa, have some tea. I learned how to brew it from a monk, and he’s really good at it.”

“Ah, thank you.” After drinking the tea she offered, I tidied up my sleeping area and looked around the room. ‘There are quite a few books.’

Even in the monks’ living quarters, there were bookshelves filled with books. I picked one at random and started reading. ‘Hmm, this fairy tale… I’ve seen it in the Water Realm…’ I flipped through the familiar fairy tale book and put it back. It seemed that fairy tales with the theme of ‘sincerity moves heaven’ existed in the Guanghan Realm as well. I read several books on Buddhist techniques and the Seven Fire King, broadening my understanding.

After a while, Kim Yeon, who was using the Mysterious Heart Technique, spoke. “Eunhyeon oppa, Master Tae is calling for you.”

“Ah, okay. Let’s go then.” I put the books back on the shelf and followed her to the reception hall of Tae Yeol Temple. There, Tae Yeol Temple was waiting with several books.

“These are the Buddhist techniques you requested. There are ritual techniques, extension techniques, and general techniques. Take them and learn as you wish.” I expressed my gratitude and picked up a book to read, only to be startled.

“Wait… aren’t these all techniques that can be mastered from the Origin Energy to the Fusion Stage!?” I had expected techniques at most up to the Foundation Establishment or Core Formation stages, but recognizing their value made my hands tremble. Tae Yeol Temple smiled and said, “I have no talent for celestial techniques, so my cultivation can only reach the Core Formation stage. These books hold no value to me beyond their worth as scriptures.”

“…What do you want in return?”

“What do I want? I told you, they hold no great value to me. I’m giving them to you for free, as a fellow cultivator.”

“Hmm…” I skimmed through the ritual techniques, extension techniques, and celestial techniques, picking only those that seemed most beneficial to me. “Thank you.”

“It’s nothing.” After thanking Tae Yeol Temple, I chatted with her for a while. Then, out of curiosity, I asked, “By the way… Master Tae, may I ask you something?”

It was something I had been curious about since meeting her. “What is it?”

“The manifestation you achieved, is it called the Heavenly Flower Path?”

“Yes, that’s correct.”

“Having faced the Heavenly Flower Path, I felt that its essence was the celestial technique you mastered, the Celestial Technique.”

Indeed, she had reached the Celestial Stage through cultivation, akin to a martial artist reaching the peak through internal energy techniques. Given her background, it made sense that she had achieved the Celestial Stage through celestial techniques rather than martial arts. It was similar to how Qing Wenling had reached the Celestial Stage through his obsession with the Enlightened Path. I wondered how such a thing was possible. If it were possible, why hadn’t more cultivators achieved the Celestial Stage through their obsession with celestial techniques?

Tae Yeol Temple smiled and said, “I am a religious person before I am a cultivator. As someone who has devoted herself to the faith of the Seven Fire King, I have developed my belief to the extreme, which led to my manifestation.”

“Hmm…” So the key was not an obsession with the celestial technique itself but a specific enlightenment within the technique. I felt a pang of sympathy and curiosity about Qing Wenling and asked her, “Is it possible to reach the Celestial Stage through Daoist techniques? For example, by pursuing the Enlightened Path?”

“In theory, it is possible. However, Daoist techniques are much more difficult than Buddhist techniques.”

“Why is that?”

“Buddhist techniques define the existence of the mind and its interactions. The Seven Fire King is said to reside within us in the form of the mind. But Daoist techniques are different. They are solitary practices. Therefore, Daoist techniques are far more difficult to manifest than Buddhist techniques.”

“Hmm…”

“And one more thing.” She explained another difference between Daoist and Buddhist techniques. “While Buddhist techniques derive their foundation from the Seven Fire King, most Daoist techniques derive their foundation from [Heaven] and [Earth]. Celestial techniques and terrestrial techniques. Especially celestial techniques, which, as they are mastered, make one less concerned with human thoughts, making manifestation even more distant.”

“Hmm… I see.” It seemed that the more one mastered celestial techniques, the further one moved away from the enlightenment required for manifestation. I had also felt that the higher my realm, the more the enlightenment required by celestial, terrestrial, and spiritual techniques diverged. After exchanging a few more words with her, I thanked her and stood up.

“Thank you for your insights. I look forward to working with you as a fellow cultivator and a fellow spiritual practitioner.”

“Hahaha, a spiritual practitioner. I may have left my master, but I am not a spy. Perhaps it is you who is the spy.”

She joked back at my jest and saw Yeon-i and me off. As we stood at the main gate of Tae Yeol Temple, I suddenly had another question. “By the way, I have one more question.”

“What is it?”

“If you don’t want to answer, you don’t have to. Is there a reason why your name and the name of Tae Yeol Temple are the same?”

“…”

“If this is an inappropriate question, I apologize.”

“No, it’s not a big deal. I don’t have a real name. I was born and raised in Tae Yeol Temple. I don’t know who my real parents are, nor do I care to know. I have always identified myself with Tae Yeol Temple.”

Tae Yeol Temple kindly explained the origin of her name. “The previous master of Tae Yeol Temple told me to return to the secular world and find my parents, so he didn’t give me a Dharma name. But I didn’t want to sever my ties with Tae Yeol Temple, so I gave myself the name Tae Yeol Temple.”

She clasped her hands together and saw us off. “My name is Tae Yeol Temple. I am just a rogue who didn’t listen to the previous master of Tae Yeol Temple.”

We also clasped our hands together and turned away. Meeting her had given me much to think about and much to gain. I returned to Cheonbu Mountain from Tae Yeol Temple and asked Yeon-i for a favor.

“Minhee unni?”

“Yes. Is it possible? You know that Jeon Myeonghun and I didn’t get along well, and you also know that Kang Minhee and I weren’t on good terms.”

“Hmm, you two didn’t get along?”

For some reason, Kim Yeon looked at me with half-closed eyes. I was puzzled and confused. “Yes, well. I’ll try to contact her. I have something to discuss with Minhee unni anyway… and I want to see her too.”

“Okay, thank you.”

After a while, Kim Yeon contacted the Black Ghost Valley. The reply came quickly. Kyaaah— A ghost from the Black Ghost Valley came to the training ground where Yeon-i and I were training. Yeon-i, who was practicing the Flying Phoenix Dance in front of me, looked at the ghost, and the ghost approached her. She connected with the ghost using the Mysterious Heart Technique. After receiving the ghost’s reply, her expression brightened.

“Oppa! Minhee unni said she’ll have time in about fifteen days, so let’s meet then!”

“Oh! As expected…”

Kim Yeon, who was the most beloved in the sect, received a quick reply. However, I felt something strange. ‘Wait, Kang Minhee seems to have plenty of free time from Seorip’s perspective. Why meet in fifteen days?’

It was as it seemed. Currently, I had become quite close to Kang Minhee as Seorip. She had quickly become friendly with Seorip, saying he felt familiar. Thanks to that, I knew she had plenty of free time. ‘So why in fifteen days?’

I wondered if there was a reason and read the celestial signs. ‘Fifteen days from now is the day when the yin energy is strongest in the Guanghan Realm, once a year.’

It was like the winter solstice. There seemed to be a reason for that specific time. And fifteen days passed.

* * *

Wooong! ‘I’ was flying through the sky using the Flying Escape Technique. Recently, I had been performing various missions for the Black Scale Ghost Sect, accumulating 300 merit points. With 700 points or reaching the Celestial Stage, I could officially join the Ghost Soul Pavilion. Today, I was on another mission. It was a 700-point mission directly assigned by the Ghost Soul Pavilion’s master, Kang Minhee.

‘I see why Kang Minhee wanted to meet Yeon-i today.’

Swoosh— I flew through the night sky using the Flying Escape Technique, entering the vast swamp area of Hanumtaek, east of the Yun Do region, outside the Yun Do region’s main alliance. Hanumtaek was a swamp area thick with yin energy, inhabited by the reptilian celestial race, the Yeopta tribe. I went to the outskirts of the Yeopta tribe’s territory, where human access was allowed, and found a place with strong yin energy.

‘This place will do.’

I found a suitably damp and deep swamp and released the ghosts I had brought from the Black Ghost Valley. As the ghosts spread out in the already damp Hanumtaek, eerie wails and sobs echoed everywhere.

Kyaaah— Sob sob sob… Aaaah!

Unlike before, after mastering the Ghost King’s Demon Art, I could change the form of death to avoid agitating the ghosts, so they didn’t flee in terror. When I commanded them as the Ghost King, the ghosts began to form a formation according to my orders. It was a formation Kang Minhee had taught me. After a while, a giant pattern formed by the ghosts appeared over the swamp of Hanumtaek. The pattern depicted a giant Ghost King, with the character for ‘longevity’ written upside down on its face. I gathered the surrounding yin and ghost energy, formed a seal, and chanted an incantation. At some point, the formation, which had been absorbing yin energy, began to emit it.

Ssssh— The surroundings became even more eerie and filled with a terrifying aura. When the aura reached its peak, I completed all the seals and chanted the final incantation. 

Shaaah! In an instant, it felt like a giant beast had torn through space, and the area where the pattern was drawn rotted away in an instant. At the same time, I saw black darkness streaming into the Guanghan Realm. ‘Hmm, this feels like summoning a great demon.’

It was just a ritual to summon an ex-girlfriend. After a while, as the black darkness subsided, I saw something emerging from beyond the darkness. It was a giant ghostly figure with disheveled hair, leading thousands of ghost kings, and holding black ghost birds in both hands. As the ghostly figure planted its hands with the ghost birds into the ground of the Guanghan Realm, it began to rise. 

Ssssh— I used the Ghost King’s Demon Art to create chains and bound the ghostly figure’s wrists. Then I began to pull the ghostly figure into the Guanghan Realm from the sky. After a while, the eight-foot-tall ghostly figure finally set foot on the ground of the Guanghan Realm. The numerous ghost kings that had followed it screamed in regret and remained beyond the darkness, and the dark space I had opened began to close. After a while, the ghostly figure’s body began to shrink. 

Ssssh— Finally, the ghostly figure shrank to the size of a human woman and became a naked woman in the darkness. Her breath, like a ghostly wail, swept through Hanumtaek, freezing the swamp within a 70-ri radius. She smiled and took a step forward. The ghostly energy around her naturally covered her body, and soon she transformed into the appearance of wearing a black robe from the Black Ghost Valley. ‘That is…’

The Black Ghost Valley’s Black Elder, Kang Minhee’s true form. I bowed my head in front of her, letting my hair down. I was also wearing the black robe characteristic of the Black Ghost Valley, so we looked like a clear superior and subordinate. “Black Ghost Valley’s Ghost Disciple Seorip. I have completed the mission assigned by the Elder.”

She exhaled frost with each breath and smiled. “Here it is.” I offered her the pipe that my clone often smoked. The 700-point mission I had taken on was to help Kang Minhee’s true form enter the Guanghan Realm from the ‘side path.’ She lit the pipe with ghostly fire and walked to a suitable spot. Then, ghost kings of at least the Celestial Stage rose from her shadow and created an ice chair where her gaze fell. Kang Minhee sat on the ice chair. The ice became even more solid and frozen in her cold breath. She smoked the pipe, exhaling blue smoke, and looked at me with amazement.

“…”

I bowed my head and expressed my gratitude. “Thank you, Elder. And… I will take my leave now.”

I knew why Kang Minhee wasn’t returning to the Black Ghost Valley immediately and was staying in Hanumtaek. Today was the day she was meeting Kim Yeon. Kang Minhee had contacted Kim Yeon with the condition that ‘Jeon Myeonghun and Seo Eunhyeon should not be brought along.’ Therefore, I shouldn’t be here. However, Kang Minhee looked at me with wide eyes as if to say, ‘What are you talking about?’

“Hmm… Then can I leave when she arrives?”

“Ah, no…”

I ended up staying with Kang Minhee. For a while, we chatted, and at some point, I was combing her hair. “Is this okay?”

“Hmm. Ahhh. Hmm hmm.” She began to speak in a soft voice. “Hmm, nice. You’re good at combing hair. Who taught you?”

‘You did.’

“Someone taught me a long time ago.”

“Whoever it was, they taught you well.”

I recalled the times I used to comb her hair when she was tired and combed her hair, occasionally massaging her scalp. Kang Minhee felt my touch and took a puff from the pipe. Blue smoke rose as she remained silent for a moment. “It was cold. The side path… was a place directly connected to the Ghost Realm, where ghostly energy and yin energy poured in.”

“Is that so?”

“So I might have missed this warmth. I could feel it indirectly through my clone, but the warmth felt directly by my true form is definitely more special.”

She relaxed and rested comfortably, feeling my touch. “Should I massage your shoulders too?”

“Please do.”

I naturally comforted her in the order she used to like. Under the night sky, her shoulders, which had been cold, gradually warmed up. And time passed. 

Shaaah! In the distance, a pinkish light flew in. It was Yeon-i. I felt uncomfortable as if I were breaking a promise, but since Kang Minhee had told me not to leave, I stayed. Yeon-i emerged from the light. She and Kang Minhee’s eyes met. Tap tap— Kang Minhee immediately put away the pipe and warmly greeted Kim Yeon.

“Yeon-ah~ It’s been so long! My cute little one! How have you been?”

“Unni~ I haven’t been well… but it wasn’t unbearable.”

Kang Minhee squeezed Kim Yeon’s cheeks with both hands, and Kim Yeon smiled happily. After laughing and chatting for a while, Kang Minhee introduced me to Kim Yeon. “This is Seorip. He’s a friend who helps me. Is it okay if he stays?”

“Of course. Hello, I’m Kim Yeon, Minhee unni’s younger sister. You’re very pretty too, unni!”

“Uh… um… thank you.”

There was something I needed to correct, but I awkwardly smiled and let it pass. After a brief reunion, they moved to a nearby rock, created a space with Earth Escape Technique, and began to talk in earnest. I felt drained being between them but endured. Then, while talking with Kang Minhee, Kim Yeon cleared her throat and spoke in a slightly serious voice.

“Minhee unni.”

“Hmm? What is it?”

“Have you met any other colleagues?”

“Colleagues?”

“People from the company.”

“…No. I haven’t met them. I’ve heard some news, but I haven’t sought them out… I heard that bastard Jeon Myeonghun… died?”

“…? The manager isn’t dead.”

“Oh… I thought I heard something about a sect being wiped out… I must have heard wrong. Ugh, why isn’t that bastard dead?”

She said that, but she was secretly relieved. “Hehe, well… I think Eunhyeon oppa saved him somehow.”

“…”

“…Minhee unni.”

“What?”

“I…”

After some hesitation, Kim Yeon glanced at me and spoke in Korean so I wouldn’t understand. “I… started dating Eunhyeon oppa.”

Kim Yeon spoke while watching Kang Minhee’s reaction. For a moment, they were both silent. Kim Yeon cautiously asked, “Is that okay…?”
