**Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 402: With the Wind (5)**

She looked at me for a moment before speaking. 

"...Alright. If my benefactor wishes for information, I shall provide it."

I walked with her through the palace corridors. After some time, we arrived at the library with the queen and Yukyo. Upon arrival, the first thing she did was dismiss all the attendants and guards before entering a corner of the library.

"Your Majesty, this place is...?"

"You should know by now. The various circumstances of the Fenglai Kingdom..."

When the queen placed her palm on a corner of the wall, it suddenly shone brightly and transformed into a pure white door.

Creak—

The queen walked through the door, and Yukyo and I followed her inside.

"...!"

I couldn't help but be startled by the scene behind the door. The entire world was covered in pitch-black [darkness]! Yet, strangely, I could still discern my surroundings within this darkness. It wasn't due to any special awareness or heightened senses. It was simply an inexplicable space.

And I had been in such a space once before.

'This is the same space as when I faced [that being]!'

It felt identical to the encounter I had with [him], presumed to be a true immortal, at the bottom of the Fengming Lake.

Step, step...

I followed the queen, and Yukyo, though flustered, managed to walk steadily while groping ahead. How long did we traverse through the darkness? Suddenly, a white [light] flickered ahead.

"...!"

Unlike my previous encounter with [him], I saw a flickering white [light] ahead. Yukyo, seemingly relieved by the light, quickened her pace towards it, while I, recalling the warnings about 'beware of the light,' slowed my steps.

"Come here. What are you doing?"

"...Understood."

Seeing me hesitate, the queen looked at me curiously and spoke. We reached the place where the light was, and I discovered the source of the light.

"...Salt?"

It was, amusingly, salt. A small brazier held the salt, which emitted a soft, white light, illuminating the surroundings. The area was a library, surrounded by darkness. The queen took out three chairs from one side of the library, handed one to Yukyo and me, and then took out another for herself.

"Sit down. This might be a tedious conversation. I hope you understand that I can't offer tea."

"...It's fine."

"By the way, are you uncomfortable?"

"Except for the darkness and the light, it's quite alright."

I watched the light emanating from the salt with caution.

"Isn't it customary to discuss important matters in the darkness rather than in the light?"

At my words, the queen of Fenglai Kingdom gave a meaningful smile.

"Are you afraid of the light?"

"It's not that I'm afraid of the light, but rather that I'm cautious."

"You know who to fear. You fear the god of light, don't you?"

"...!"

Startled, I stood up and clutched my head, looking back and forth between Yukyo and the queen of Fenglai Kingdom. However, neither the queen nor even Yukyo reacted, merely blinking their eyes.

Even...

'I'm fine too?'

No matter how much I had recently developed a slight resistance to higher beings, it was strange that there was no issue mentioning them. I was bewildered.

"Looking at the peak of a great mountain can break your neck because the mountain is too high. But if the mountain is partially obscured by clouds, your gaze only reaches the clouds, and your neck won't break."

Her words made me realize that this space was safe.

"Is it alright to mention them?"

"At least for my daughter and me. I don't know about you. If you're worried, don't mention them carelessly."

"...Understood. Then, this light..."

I asked, looking at the white light seeping from the salt. The queen smiled faintly and spoke.

"Chachukjejon... No, didn't your dreamers call it the god of the salt mountain?"

"...!"

I was startled by her words but soon calmed down. It made sense. Fenglai Island was clearly within the domain of the god of the salt mountain, so it wasn't strange for him to be considered the god or deity of Fenglai Kingdom.

'Wait, then what is Charyunjejon?'

As I wondered, he patted my shoulder, stopping me. It was better not to mention that name in the darkness.

"Ah, yes. Understood."

Having experienced the consequences of mentioning names carelessly through Joryeo, I remained silent. The queen pointed to the glowing salt and spoke.

"According to legend, Chachukjejon stole light from the realm of light. When he created this world, he illuminated it with the light he brought, and the remaining light was bestowed upon us."

"...Then, isn't all the light in Fenglai Kingdom safe?"

Why did we come to this dark place? I suddenly had this question and asked. But she shook her head.

"Light can go anywhere. Do you know how much external light enters whenever Fenglai Kingdom connects with the outside world? The light outside has already mixed to some extent. The pure light of Chachukjejon remains only here."

I had heard that on the day Fenglai Island opened, Haerin prohibited the light of the high realm itself, but it seemed that wasn't enough.

"Well... I understand. May I ask my questions now?"

"Go ahead. I'll answer what I know or recommend a book from the library."

She pointed to the surrounding dark library with a gentle voice. I pondered what to ask and then questioned her.

"Did Yukrin also enter this library?"

But she shook her head at my words.

"Only those who know Chachukjejon can enter this library. They can't even perceive the entrance. The deity set it up that way. There are a few more restrictions, but they're minor... Anyway, he didn't know Chachukjejon, so he couldn't step in."

"...I see."

It was unexpectedly a place with extremely stringent entry conditions.

'You have to know the deity to enter.'

Among mortals, only Seo Hyul and I could even think of entering. I shook my head and continued with the next question. It was a seemingly trivial but important question.

"...Why are the people of this country human?"

The queen of Fenglai Kingdom looked at me as if I were speaking nonsense.

"Ah... It seems you don't understand. Where should I start explaining..."

It was probably the same look Earthlings would give if asked, 'Why are humans the dominant species on Earth?' But having lived in this world for thousands of years, I knew well. In this world, humans were not particularly noble beings. They were just one of the many intelligent species, and due to their vicious nature, they occupied one of the six pillars of the Celestial Race in the Guanghan Realm without any backing from a deity. Impressive, but not particularly special. They were a moderately dominant species that had found a place in the world. That was the human race.

However, Fenglai Kingdom was strange. Despite many species entering Fenglai Island and playing roles in the world, why did everyone in Fenglai Kingdom walk around in human form?

'Yukyo is a carp hybrid of the Yao race, but in this world, she's half-human, half-dragon, and Jinmayeoldo is a Tugu race but appears as a normal human.'

Of course, there were various monsters, but it was a bit unnatural for the ruler of this world to be 'specifically' human. After my explanation, the queen seemed to ponder for a moment before speaking.

"I don't know much about that. This world is natural to us... But I do know where you might find information on why humans are the dominant species."

The queen pointed to a section of the library filled with bamboo scrolls.

"Read the information there. You might find what you're looking for. Probably."

I stood up and took out the bamboo scrolls.

'This is...?'

It was a kind of mythological text. Among them, a book called 'Fenglai Chronicles' briefly described the creation of the Fenglai Kingdom.

- In the beginning, there was a world filled only with dreams.
- Chachukjejon, feeling pity, created a new heaven with the help of Charyunjejon, Hyongo, and the Heavenly King.
- Charyunjejon rolled the wheel to guide good souls under the new heaven, and the three Heavenly Kings performed miracles to create a land suitable for us to live in.
- The primordial giant Hyongo promised to prevent snakes from entering this land at the request of Chachukjejon.

'Hyongo?'

Seeing a familiar name, I examined the description of that being.

- When Hyongo made the promise, his shadow became the bodies of souls, giving birth to us. We have two eyes and two ears...

It was a description of humans. Although the described Hyongo was quite large, covering the entire sky with one hand. That was Hyongo (玄古). The content of the bamboo scroll ended there. Looking around, I found another scroll explaining Hyongo.

- He is the most divine beast.
- He is called the god who presides over all contracts and covenants.
- He is known as the [Master of Names], presiding over all naming in the universe.

'Hyongoji, Hyongopae!'

I finally understood why the most revered contract paper in the high realm was called Hyongoji (玄古紙). The divine being presiding over all contracts and covenants was Hyongo. However, I suddenly felt my heart pounding.

'Wait, did I just learn the true name of a great being?'

Throb, throb...

It was fine here, but if I remembered this name outside...

'I'm being watched, I'm being watched, I'm being watched!'

Thump, thump, thump...

I calmed my trembling heart and continued reading the bamboo scrolls, discovering a reassuring fact. It was about another being recorded in a different scroll.

- Haetae
- He is another divine beast.
- He symbolizes peace and tranquility...

'These scrolls refer to divine beasts as 'divine beasts'.'

The term for divine beasts wasn't their true name, so knowing it wasn't a problem. In other words, 'Hyongo' wasn't the true name of that being but referred to its species. And I realized another thing here.

'The fact that humans became the dominant species in Fenglai Kingdom due to Hyongo means...'

Just as dragons become black dragons or azure dragons when they become divine beasts, humans become divine beasts with the name 'Go' attached. 

Rustle—

After resolving my questions, I rolled up the bamboo scrolls and put them back. While I was reading, Yukyo seemed bored and was trying to move one of the chairs, and the queen was scolding her for her behavior. I interrupted their conversation with a question.

"It was very helpful. May I ask another question?"

"Go ahead."

"It's about Chachukjejon. I believe you know well about him."

"Indeed."

"It might be considered blasphemy... but please answer. Is the deity truly dead?"
