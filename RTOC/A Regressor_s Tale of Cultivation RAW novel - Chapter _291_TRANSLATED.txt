My name is (6) "The fact that you sent this letter to Senior Wei means…."

"Yes. She also knows that you have been appointed as the Taishu of the Human Clan. And according to the information from the spies on the side of the Beast Clan…."

Wei Lingshen took out a jade slip from his sleeve and began to explain after reading it.

"Recently, there has been information that a Dragon King has been born in the Yellow Dragon Clan. The Dragon Clan is keeping it under wraps to reveal it at a critical moment… but it is highly likely that the one causing trouble for you, Taishu Guji, is the newly ascended Dragon King, Guryun. Given her talent, it makes sense."

"Hmm…."

Guryun, who became a Dragon King. I recalled her from my previous life. Even at the level of a quasi-fusion, the power of the beam she emitted from her mouth was tremendous. Yes, just about that level.

'I think I can handle her….'

If it were Seo Hyul, who had reached the true fusion stage, it would be a bit scary, but if it's just Guryun….

'Hmm, not scary at all.'

I felt sorry for Guryun, but purely in terms of combat power, she was similar to or slightly below Wei Lingshen. Wei Lingshen had not learned techniques suitable for combat, making him the weakest among the Human Clan's fusion stage experts. Even compared to such a weakling, she was not that strong at the moment. Of course, if she stabilized her realm and gained experience after reaching the initial fusion stage, it might be different, but in her current state, she was not scary at all.

And what puzzled me was that she herself would know this.

"The fact that she sent a letter to Senior Wei means she knows I am the Taishu, which means she has heard about what I have been doing since entering the Celestial Realm in the past few weeks, right?"

"Yes. The Dragon Clan must have heard all the commotion through the spies they planted in the Human Clan. They must also be well aware of your combat power and potential."

My noisy exploits, such as defeating the Celestial Realm's inspectors, killing Seo Hyul in one blow, and defeating Wei Lingshen head-on within his domain, were already known throughout the Celestial Realm. The Beast Clan must have received this information through their spies in the Celestial Realm, so why would they threaten me like this?

'Is it because of Seo Hyul?'

She would lose her mind when it came to Seo Hyul, so it was possible.

'If it's not Seo Hyul, she is rational enough to give a chance for an explanation even if I openly betrayed her like in my previous life. If she heard that I killed Seo Hyul because he did something to her, Guryun would have lost her mind. In that case… this incident must be Seo Hyul's move, not Guryun's.'

My head became complicated.

'Is Seo Hyul alive, or is he dead?'

I had disintegrated his soul and scattered his essence, ensuring his death. Seeing Guryun's rage at Seo Hyul's death confirmed it. But it was too coincidental.

'If Guryun goes berserk and attacks me, and I kill her?'

Assuming Seo Hyul is alive, he would get what he wanted, as he always wanted to get rid of her.

'Seo Hyul is definitely dead.'

I had completely cut off the path for his resurrection. Yet, the illusion of Seo Hyul, with that damn smile, seemed to be making a move with Guryun's name.

'…A snake-like bastard.'

I didn't want to imagine it, but I decided to assume Seo Hyul was still alive.

'If he is alive, what benefits him, and what harms him?'

Killing Guryun benefits him. So what harms him?

"Thank you for delivering the letter, Senior Wei. I will handle Guryun later."

"Hmm, if it seems dangerous, step back. You are the future of the Human Clan. The leader is putting effort into helping you reach the fusion stage, so if you want to do something, tell us."

"…Yes, I understand."

I was currently being protected in the Eastern Division of the Human Clan's Celestial Realm. Every day, fusion stage Taishus visited my division, teaching me the secrets and techniques of the fusion stage, and giving me all sorts of spiritual liquids, pills, and fruits to help me reach the fusion stage quickly.

'Fusion stage….'

Having directly ascended from the Great Circle of the Origin Stage to the Great Circle of the Celestial Stage, reaching the fusion stage was not a dream as long as I was prepared. Everyone was curious about how strong I would become if I reached the fusion stage, given that I could already exert fusion stage power at the Celestial Stage.

Among them, the leader of the Human Clan, Junje, was searching for a spiritual liquid called Cheonganlu, which helps in the promotion from the Celestial Stage to the fusion stage.

'If I reach the fusion stage, Hyeonwon won't be as scary.'

Of course, considering Hyeonwon's power, it wouldn't be easy even at the fusion stage, but at least I wouldn't die helplessly like last time.

I looked at the back of Wei Lingshen leaving my division and smiled bitterly.

'They keep talking about spies, but it seems like I'm really going to become a spy.'

I appreciated the Taishus' intention to help me reach the fusion stage, but to thwart Seo Hyul's plans, I had to move.

'The action that would harm Seo Hyul the most is probably involving the Demon Army.'

I immediately set my goal.

'Bring Oh Hyunseok to the Guanghan Realm as quickly as possible, end the Human-Demon War, and find Kim Yeon without letting Changhoja die.'

If I kidnapped Kim Yeon and hinted to the Demon Army that Seo Hyul was preparing for marriage and they should go to the True Dragon Alliance, they would be thrilled.

'Even the Mad Dragon King Hyeon-eum wouldn't dare to intervene in the Human-Demon War if the True Dragon Alliance headquarters were bombed.'

Whether Seo Hyul was truly dead or not was uncertain. But having died once at my hands and using his death as an excuse to move Guryun, Seo Hyul couldn't act openly while Guryun was alive.

So, while Seo Hyul couldn't act openly, I had many things I could do.

'In this life, while Seo Hyul can't act openly….'

I set another goal. Kim Younghoon was in the High Power Realm, so I couldn't help it. Oh Hyeso would be living well on her own, so I didn't care. Excluding those two, I aimed to reunite with Jeon Myunghoon, Kang Minhee, Oh Hyunseok, and Kim Yeon.

That was my new goal.

* * *

'Jeon Myunghoon is easy since he's with the main body, and I can meet Oh Hyunseok after resolving the Human-Demon War. I can see Kim Yeon again if I kidnap her from the Demon Army. So, the remaining one is Kang Minhee….'

In this case, the role of 'Seorip' became important.

'I' sighed as I received the emotions of the main body inside the Great Tomb of the Black Ghost Valley.

'Damn it, Kang Minhee or whatever… I need to accept the Ghost King to do anything.'

The Ghost Kings kept running away, making me sigh deeply.

'What should I do….'

While I was pondering, I suddenly thought of the Yin Soul Ghost Art.

'Come to think of it, when I covered the Ghost King with the Yin Soul Ghost Art, the Ghost King didn't seem to feel much fear towards me, as if hypnotized?'

If so, would the Ghost Kings feel less death if I covered my body with the Yin Soul Ghost Art?

'I need to test it right away.'

Tsssss—

I poured out countless curse scripts, covering my entire body with pain.

Ssssss—

My entire body was covered in black curse scripts. I hesitated at the tingling pain but realized that the atmosphere of the Great Tomb had changed.

'It worked!'

As expected, it was solved with a fairly simple method!

Rumble—

The Great Tomb vibrated, and I saw countless Ghost Kings rushing in like waves from afar. Unlike before, when they screamed and fled in panic, the Ghost Kings were flying in a much more rational manner.

And when the Ghost Kings reached above me, I spoke to them politely. My voice, covered in curse scripts, resonated with a thick curse, echoing through the space. I felt the Ghost Kings around me flinch in surprise.

'Hmm, is it a rare sight for the Ghost Kings of the Great Tomb?'

It seemed that pouring out curse scripts like an ocean with the Yin Soul Ghost Art was not an easy task.

While countless Ghost Kings were buzzing around me, one Ghost King looked down at me with an angry face and shouted. I looked at him, and our eyes met. The Ghost King, at the Celestial Stage level, became even more furious and shouted at me.

The Ghost King, with his eyes turned upside down, lashed out at me, and I raised the curse script in my hand and spoke.

The Ghost King trembled and approached me, staring at the curse script. How long did he stare at the curse script? The Ghost King spoke with a trembling voice.

I felt something strange in his tone and asked.

The Ghost King suddenly became furious, extending his black ghost claws to grab my body. I was startled and tried to shake him off. However, he persistently scratched my body and the curse script covering it with his ghost claws, eventually tearing off the curse script covering my body.

"Damn it!"

At the same time, my soul reappeared in the Great Tomb. And the ghosts started going crazy again. The dozens and hundreds of Ghost Kings around me fled, and the Ghost King who had torn off my curse script also went mad and fled.

Crack….

I felt the veins on my forehead bulge as I reached out to the Ghost King who caused this mess.

Rumble—

A wave of black curse scripts turned into a giant hand and grabbed the Ghost King. Since I hadn't kindly converted the Yin Soul Ghost Art into the power of Yin, the Ghost King howled in pain. However, even while howling in pain, the fear towards me seemed to have been diluted, as he started to speak instead of wailing.

"Hmm?"

Listening to his words, I realized what kind of Ghost King he was.

He, intoxicated by the Yin Soul Ghost Art I created, felt the aura of death and moved his black ghost body, kneeling with his hands together.

"…You…."

I chuckled and asked the Ghost King.

"Are you the creator of the Yin Soul Ghost Art?"

Indeed, he was a ghost spirit from the faction researching curse techniques in the Black Ghost Valley. After swearing loyalty to me, he settled in my forbidden area, continuously receiving the power of the Yin Soul Ghost Art. Half-regaining his sanity, he swore to support and help me fully.

"Then, have you all decided on the Ghost Kings you will serve?"

Excluding me, the bald tattooed man, the corpse man, the woman in white, and Heo Namkwon all nodded with pale faces. Looking closely, black energy was dwelling in their bodies. It seemed they had all decided to serve at least Celestial Stage level Ghost Kings.

Eupyeon looked at me, who hadn't nodded, and asked.

"What about you, Sir Seo?"

I also nodded awkwardly.

"Well… I have decided for now."

I had chosen a Ghost King to serve me, not one I would serve. Anyway, it was decided.

I sensed the Ghost King sitting quietly next to Wonyeong inside my forbidden area and asked.

'Hey, Biyul.'

'Why are you so quiet in the shrine when you caused such a ruckus inside the Great Tomb?'

The Ghost King, who had sworn loyalty to me, was named Biyul. After swearing loyalty, he settled in my forbidden area, continuously receiving the power of the Yin Soul Ghost Art. Half-regaining his sanity, Biyul swore to support and help me fully.

"Since it seems everyone has decided on the Ghost Kings they will serve, I will now guide you to the technique library."

We followed Eupyeon out of the shrine and moved to another space in Seomyeongham. After some time, we arrived in front of a library with the sign 'Seomyeong Library.'

"Librarian, this is Eupyeon, the servant of Baekjin, the disciple of the Sect Leader. Please let us in."

A voice came from inside the library.

It seemed to include the Ghost Kings within us as well.

We entered the library and saw the librarian's face. I was startled as soon as I saw him.

'Songjin?'

He looked very much like Songjin, who occasionally showed his appearance in life.

"Welcome. I am Songgil, the librarian of the Black Ghost Valley. In this valley, disciples below the Ghost Soul level are assigned a master who recommends techniques, but from the Yin Soul level, you are given the opportunity to choose your techniques. Feel free to browse the library and choose one technique each. You have one incense stick's time."

I stared at Songgil's face for a moment before stepping into the technique library.

'He must be Songjin's brother….'

I thought about greeting him but decided against it. Songjin was probably doing well with Seoran in the High Power Realm, so there was no need to mention it.

"Hmm?"

I pondered for a moment at Biyul's words and then nodded. After all, he knew the techniques of the Black Ghost Valley better.

After a while, I selected seven technique books under Biyul's guidance. The technique books were as follows:

- Silver Basket Demon Technique (銀籃魔功)
- Purple Sun Mad Demon Technique (紫陽狂魔功)
- Secret Ritual of Corpse Eating (屍食秘禮本)
- True Art of Soul Peace (安魂眞訣)
- Secret Transmission of the Demon King (閻魔秘傳意)
- True Demon Technique of Soul Expenditure (費魂眞魔功)
- Demon Immortal's Ghost Technique (鬼仙奎魔訣)
