The spirits of the underworld all craved the "flesh of the living." Even if it wasn't the flesh of the living, they longed for a vessel that could house their souls, like the body of a jiangshi or the form of a wall ghost. The reason was simple. They were all spirits, constantly tormented by the pull of the underworld.

There were generally three ways to endure the pull of the underworld. The first was the simplest: using one's own cultivation to resist it. This was only possible for ghost kings of at least the Shachuki level. The second was to capture another spirit and offer it as a sacrifice to temporarily reduce one's own pull. This was usually done by vengeful spirits or extremely malicious ghosts through dark rituals. However, this method was avoided even by those in the dark arts because each time the ritual was performed, the death aura around the practitioner grew stronger, making the pull of the underworld even more intense.

The third method was to obtain a "body." Whether it was the decaying flesh of a jiangshi or the form of a wall ghost, finding a vessel that suited them could significantly free them from the pull of the underworld. Among these, the "body of the living" was extremely valuable. Even a ghost king with a powerful death aura could gain immense freedom from the pull of the underworld if they entered the body of the living. Although the body would lose its vitality over time, the ghost could still move freely, almost as if they were alive.

Of course, this wasn't perfect, as the body would gradually become that of the dead. However, in the underworld, the body of the living was considered the best tool for extending one's lifespan. Additionally, a ghost king who obtained the body of the living could hide their death aura within the living flesh, making it less noticeable.

However, the old ghost in front of me was carrying an enormous amount of death aura with 19 heads. This was understandable if one had been cultivating deep within the underworld for a long time or had been eroded by a celestial being after staring at the sky for too long. Such a being was still within the realm of common sense, even if they were a puppet of a celestial being and could go berserk at any moment.

But a being with such a crazy level of death aura actually had the body of the living?

"Moreover, the death aura hasn't diminished at all, even though the appearance has changed...!"

This meant that the death aura emitted in their normal state was already at that level, not because they were deliberately revealing their ghost king form. There were two possible scenarios. First, this madman had obtained the body of the living and committed suicide 19 times to gain such a crazy level of death aura. Second, they had sacrificed tens or hundreds of thousands of other spirits to the underworld, continuously strengthening their own death aura to reach this state.

Either way, they were a considerable madman and a malicious ghost.

"No, if it's the first case, the fact that the death aura is so clear means that the 'suicide ritual' this old ghost performed wasn't some kind of technique or ceremony, but actual death. Such a thing would be impossible unless they were a true celestial or a god. They must have obtained hundreds of bodies of the living and performed the 'suicide ritual.'"

Mangol, facing this mad old ghost for the first time since becoming the lord of Heukryuseong, couldn't guess what answer to give.

"Answer me, Lord of Heukryuseong. Why did everyone run away when they saw my face? Is the body of the living despised in the underworld? Or is this face somehow terrifying?"

As Mangol trembled, he noticed something. "Why is he asking me this? Wait, does this old ghost... really not know?"

A possibility flashed through Mangol's mind. "I see! This madman has lost his memory after repeatedly performing the dangerous 'suicide ritual' hundreds of times! I've heard that one can lose their sense of self while cultivating ghost techniques, and this must be the case with this old ghost."

He cautiously asked the old ghost, "Elder, do you intend to offer me as a sacrifice?"

"I have no such intention."

"Then it means he's not a malicious ghost who has sacrificed millions! My guess was right!"

Relieved, Mangol explained the situation to the mad old ghost, Seo Eunhyun.

* * *

"...So, I understand the situation. In the end, revealing my living body was the problem."

A mad old ghost with 19 heads was a monster within the realm of common sense, possessing unique techniques and the dangers of a celestial being. However, having a living body while emitting such a level of death aura made one either a madman or a malicious ghost who enjoyed offering large sacrifices.

"It seems that dealing with ghost techniques always results in becoming a mad old ghost."

I also understood why the reactions of the ghosts in the underworld were different from those in other realms.

"The underworld is always suppressed by the gaze of the 'higher beings,' so the death aura is always restrained. Thanks to this, the spirits of the underworld can act somewhat normally even in front of larger ghosts. However, they can't judge death intuitively, so they have to rely on the form, size, and general aura of death to judge their opponents. And honestly, Elder, just the 'general aura of death' you emit can feel quite dangerous."

In other words, my very existence was fatal to the ghosts of the underworld.

"...Damn. It would be better to live with 19 heads."

I sighed lightly and looked at the lord of Heukryuseong. "Thank you for the valuable information."

When I was in the Guanghan realm, everyone had the body of the living, so I never imagined this problem. Even Yeonwi, being a living being, didn't know about this issue and didn't teach me.

"No, Elder. I'm glad to be of help to someone as esteemed as you, a member of the noble ghost lineage."

Mangol bowed deeply and smiled. The initial fear he had of me had slightly diminished, and now there was a hint of expectation in his eyes, hoping to gain some benefit by serving me well.

"That's good. This guy might be useful. It would be good to have him as a subordinate when building a force."

Feeling a change in the celestial energy, I turned my gaze to the horizon instead of looking directly at the sky. "Oh, it's 'night' now."

The true stars, not the eyes of the celestial beings, were rising in the sky, and the yin energy was growing stronger.

"The night in the underworld is... beautiful."

I admired the countless starlight piercing through the yin energy and shining down on the earth. The underworld was brighter at night than during the day. With the eyes of the celestial beings obscured by the pull of the stars, I no longer had to worry and looked up at the sky.

At that moment, a question crossed my mind. "Wait, if the death aura is usually suppressed by the gaze of the celestial beings in the underworld... what happens when their gaze is obscured by the pull of the stars?"

And I immediately found out the answer. Mangol, who had been answering my questions with a hint of expectation, suddenly screamed madly, abandoning his skeletal body and fleeing somewhere, leaving Heukryuseong behind.

"..."

I felt the wall ghost that had been residing in the fortress of Heukryuseong also flee, abandoning the wall upon sensing my death aura. Sweeping my consciousness over the entire Heukryuseong, I felt nothing. The fortress, once a gathering place for ghosts, had become a deserted ruin because of me.

On my first day in the underworld, I succeeded in annihilating Heukryuseong.

"..."

"So, you didn't get any information?"

"That's correct."

"Hmm... well, it can't be helped. It's not a big deal. I have some information myself."

Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of Yeonwi, Hongbeom, Jeon Myeonghun, and Kim Yeon, they obtained considerable information downstream of the river.

"First of all, we are in Baekumyeok. It's a neutral zone located between the territories of the famous Ghost Palace and Bongraedo."

She continued her explanation. "And there's some good news... There's an essential element for building the Five Blessings Foundation in Baekumyeok."

I recalled her earlier explanation. There are a few essential things for building the Five Blessings Foundation. First, a true celestial or a mid-level being who governs the concept of the foundation. Second, a 'force' to gather the materials for the foundation. And lastly, a 'spiritual land.'

Naturally, the first and second were either impossible to obtain on our own or too easy, so what Yeonwi was referring to could only be one thing.

"Does that mean there's a spiritual land in Baekumyeok?"

"Yes. It seems that one of the reasons this place became a neutral zone is because the famous Ghost Palace and Bongraedo fought a long and pointless war over the spiritual land in Baekumyeok and eventually decided to give it up."

A spiritual land was an extremely important resource. For those who knew about the Five Blessings Foundation, it was an indispensable place. Even for those who didn't know about it, it was a great place to gather talented individuals who could ascend from the lower realms.

However, according to Yeonwi, using a spiritual land merely as a place to gather talent was a huge waste.

"Of course, it's a waste, but it's still an important function because it allows you to gather extraordinary talents. However, the spiritual land in Baekumyeok is quite small, so it doesn't function well as a place to gather talent. Even when it does, it's very rare. Eventually, the two sects declared it a neutral zone because it wasn't profitable."

"Hmm, if that's the case, it could be useful for escaping the underworld in an emergency."

The reason we fell into Baekumyeok was likely due to the influence of the spiritual land. As such, it might be easier to open a shortcut there than in other places.

"By the way, if it's not the famous Ghost Palace or Bongraedo, who manages the spiritual land in Baekumyeok now?"

"I was going to tell you that. The spiritual land in Baekumyeok is managed jointly by the three major ghost sects: Baekmaekmun, Wieummun, and Sihu Jong. They use it only as a place to gather talent, which is like putting pearls on a pig's neck."

Yeonwi smiled slyly, looking at me and Jeon Myeonghun alternately. "You understand, right? Let's take the pearls from the pig's neck and execute Seo Eunhyun's plan to build a force and establish the foundation!"

Jeon Myeonghun and I looked at each other, smiled, and nodded. "Let's do it."

With all the information gathered and the plan set, all that was left was to act. So, Jeon Myeonghun and I moved.

* * *

Baekmaekmun, a sect that practices necromantic techniques related to white bones. Wieummun, a sect that practices shadow and ghost king techniques. Sihu Jong, a sect that practices jiangshi techniques.

Baekumyeok was a peaceful area where these three sects coexisted harmoniously. They took turns using the spiritual land, and the sect leaders were on friendly terms, making everything run smoothly.

However, peace is never eternal. One day, a mad old ghost with 19 heads and a subordinate ghost with six shadows appeared and occupied the spiritual land, the secret place of the three major sects of Baekumyeok. These vicious monsters also kidnapped ghosts, jiangshi, and white bones living peacefully in Baekumyeok and forced them into labor in the occupied area.

In response to this outrageous act by the suddenly appearing old ghost, the three major sects of Baekumyeok convened an emergency meeting. The sect leaders, all at the Shachuki level, gathered at Baekmaekmun with stern expressions.

Baekmaekmun's leader, Baekrin, who had called for the meeting, spoke in a heavy voice. "You all know why I called you here. Today, we will discuss the mad old ghost who suddenly appeared in Baekumyeok, occupied the spiritual land, and is committing atrocities, and the evil cult, Mugeukgyodan, that he established in the area, kidnapping and enslaving the spirits of Baekumyeok."
