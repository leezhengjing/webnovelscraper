### Return to Cultivation (회귀수선전) Chapter 395: Drinking (5)

#### Underground of the Dragon Palace

In a certain prison cell that no one had entered recently, the footsteps of the Yao tribe echoed. 

Clang! Boom!

"Get in there! And Princess Liuyou, this way!"

Dragged by the Yao tribe were a skeletal demon, Bai Lin, and Princess Liuyou, known as the Princess of the Sacred Orchid. After some struggle, the demon and the Yao beast were each locked in separate cells. 

Liuyou grabbed the iron bars of her cell and bit her lip.

"...Are they really locking me up in a prison?"

In response to her words, the Yao tribe members who had captured and imprisoned her and Bai Lin clicked their tongues.

"Princess, this isn't the first time you've tried to escape with that demon. The Lord seems very angry, so reflect on your actions!"

After saying this, they left the underground prison.

"Eek, eek!"

Liuyou shook the iron bars, but she couldn't exert her strength properly due to the chains binding her arms and legs. Bai Lin, locked in the adjacent cell, was in the same predicament. After struggling to escape for a while, Liuyou sighed and sat down.

"...A prison... They don't even treat me like a daughter anymore."

"Well, Princess, you've tried to escape so many times. Thanks to you, I'm stuck in this prison too. It's quite a sight."

Liuyou chuckled at Bai Lin's words.

"Who told you to follow a swindler like me?"

"I told you before, the Cult Leader ordered me to look after you."

"That Cult Leader... Aren't you tired of being under someone else's command? If it were me, I would have escaped to find freedom."

"You may not understand, Princess, but I prefer being bound to someone."

"You're a frustrating investigator... Wait a minute."

Liuyou asked Bai Lin, "Since when did you start treating me with such respect? Even after learning I was the Lord's daughter, you didn't seem to care much."

Bai Lin remained silent. Liuyou pondered for a moment and then clapped her hands.

"Ah! It was after you returned from Penglai Island, right? You were a devout priest of the Penglai Kingdom, weren't you?"

Bai Lin reminisced for a moment and then chuckled.

"...The loyalty to the royal family still lingers. It was quite an illusion."

Liuyou gritted her teeth and retorted, "How many times do I have to tell you? This world is fake, and Penglai Kingdom is real!"

After escaping from Penglai Island, Liuyou's memory seal was not re-imposed. Thus, she vividly remembered everything from the Penglai Kingdom. Bai Lin laughed heartily and said, "How can a real world disappear like a mirage when a single palace is pulled out? Isn't that just an illusion?"

"Illusion? The formation on Penglai Island is just an entrance to the Penglai Kingdom from this world, not the Penglai Kingdom itself!"

Bang! Liuyou, seemingly agitated, struck the iron bars hard, causing her hand to bleed.

"Ouch... It hurts..."

"Even as a Yao, your skin is delicate?"

"The term 'Yao' is laughable. In the Penglai Kingdom, I was a half-human, half-dragon, with a human identity. But when I came out, I found out I was a mixed-blood Yao with a tiny bit of carp and sea dragon blood. And in this world, for some reason, my human blood disappeared, making me a Yao. Right after that, my father sealed my memories, so I lived thinking it was always like that."

"Originally a half-human, half-dragon... So, is that why you approached Sir Seoran?"

"I didn't know at the time, but thinking back, it seems so. Maybe because we shared the same half-human, half-dragon identity."

She sighed as she touched her injured hand.

"...Ugh, losing blood makes me cold..."

"Even after reaching the Yuan Ying stage, you didn't acquire the ability to resist cold and heat? If you had obtained the Yin Spirit, it wouldn't matter if your Yao power was sealed."

"Don't talk so casually about being a demon! Do you think it's easy to gain resistance to the power of Yin?"

Bai Lin chuckled and stood up. He knocked on the wall of his cell with his bony hand.

Clang! When the skeletal demon Bai Lin collided with the iron bars, a metallic sound echoed.

Clang, clang! Watching Bai Lin, Liuyou asked, "...What are you doing?"

"I'm trying to get to the next cell."

"Why?"

Clang, clang, clang! Silence fell, and only the metallic sound echoed in the underground. Liuyou asked again, "Why are you coming to me?"

She could sense some emotion directed at her from Bai Lin's eyes, hidden within his skeletal face.

"Don't come. You can't even use your powers. Instead, try to break your handcuffs or leg cuffs."

"...Do you know why I considered that world an illusion?"

"...Why?"

Liuyou asked with a puzzled look. Bai Lin smiled bitterly and said, "In that world, I dreamed of losing the person I loved again. And my only goal there was to defeat the Demon King and marry the Princess."

"Ugh..."

Liuyou's face turned slightly red at his words.

"After talking briefly with other comrades and hearing from the Six Ghost King and the General, I found a commonality among those who were possessed by that world."

"What is it?"

"In that world, the most 'painful' situation unfolds for those who are possessed."

"...?"

"In that world, everyone has to accept their pain, whether they want to or not. I felt that in that world. It seemed like the world itself was trying to teach the possessed a 'lesson.' Doesn't it feel like a fairy tale? A fairy tale that teaches a lesson to the reader."

"..."

"Of course, it's not a hopeful fairy tale. It's a fairy tale that forcibly digs into the reader's wounds and sprinkles salt on them. The pain of the wound being seared by salt makes the heart of those who entered stronger."

Clang! Bai Lin struck the bars. His eyes met Liuyou's.

"...I knew it too. I wasn't following you just because of the Cult Leader's orders. In fact, I don't have much loyalty to the Cult Leader. I joined the cult just to see my friends doing well. But until now, I think I was blinded by love, regret, and despair for my old friends."

"..."

"I fell in love with you, Princess Liuyou."

Clang! The metallic sound echoed once more in the underground.

"...That world must be an illusion. Because only then will you stay in this world."

Liuyou bit her lip.

"...It's not an illusion. That world... is real."

"Why?"

"Because the childhood I spent there and the love I received from my mother there were not lies."

"There is someone who loves you in this world too."

Clang! Liuyou gritted her teeth.

"...Why are you so obsessed with me? I've deceived you before."

"It didn't matter if I was deceived."

"I might deceive you again in the future."

"Isn't it because you think this world is fake that you keep doing such deceitful things?"

"Yes. Because this world is fake anyway."

"My feelings are real, Princess Liuyou. I know you're not originally like this. Even though it's the memory of a Penglai Kingdom priest, I know very well that you are kind-hearted and care for the people."

Liuyou's lips trembled at Bai Lin's words.

"Did you say you were born in that world? I remember you from that world. Would you lie to someone like me?"

Liuyou bit her lip. Blood dripped from her mouth.

"Thinking that world is an illusion! It's just a false appearance, and in this world, I'm just a swindler carp woman?"

She asked Bai Lin mockingly, "If I really have to return to that world, can you follow me? To the world you think is an illusion and a dream?"

At her words, Bai Lin laughed, opening his jaw.

"If you want, I will follow you."

"..."

"I once regretted not holding on in time. I won't make that mistake again."

Though Bai Lin's face was just a skull, Liuyou felt as if she could see his living face for a moment. She averted her gaze from Bai Lin with a hardened expression.

"...Do as you please. But I warn you, if you keep doing that, only your bones will break."

"It's fine."

Clang! Clang!

"...Do as you wish."

Liuyou didn't look at Bai Lin and sat down, burying her face in her knees. She seemed to be asleep. But the sound of Bai Lin striking the bars continued, and something flowed down Liuyou's cheek, falling from her chin. Liuyou ignored Bai Lin. After all, he would give up eventually.

But ten years passed. Liuyou didn't pay much attention to the underground prison, and neither did the guards. In the prison where no one entered, Bai Lin continued to strike the iron bars. 

Crack- Bai Lin's right hand had already turned to powder. But he continued to strike the bars with his right arm bone and left hand.

Clang! Finally, a part of the bars broke. Just enough for a hand to fit through. Liuyou clicked her tongue as she watched him.

"...Stop doing such foolish things."

Bai Lin silently continued to strike the bars. Twenty years passed. One side of Bai Lin's cell bars had collapsed. Since Bai Lin and Liuyou were originally locked in cells one space apart, Bai Lin still had to break through another wall. But by then, both of Bai Lin's arm bones had turned to powder. Yet, he continued to kick the bars with his legs. Sometimes, he would ram the bars with his body. Liuyou just watched him quietly. Bai Lin's body was crumbling, but the bars of her cell were gradually shaking.

In the indifference of Liuyou and the Dragon Palace officials, a ghost and a Yao gradually, little by little, got closer. Thirty years passed. Bai Lin's left half was worn away, and his left leg had turned to powder. But he continued to ram the bars with his remaining leg. Clang! Crack! Finally, one of the bars between Liuyou and Bai Lin broke slightly. But Liuyou shouted at Bai Lin.

"Stop it already! How long are you going to keep doing this?"

Bai Lin just smiled.

"We're almost there, can't you see?"

"I can't see anything! I can see your body breaking into pieces! As your body crumbles, your strength weakens. What do you want me to see? Can't you see anything?"

Bai Lin silently shone his eyes. Then he jumped again and rammed his body into Liuyou's wall.

Clang! Crack! One of Bai Lin's remaining ribs broke.

"...I can see it. Very clearly."

"Then why! Didn't you become a demon because you didn't want to die? What are you doing now?"

Bai Lin laughed heartily at her words and rammed again. Liuyou watched him, trying to say something more, but she closed her mouth. And forty years passed.

Crack- Bai Lin's body was completely shattered. Only his skull remained. No, even his jawbone had turned to powder. And, after forty years, Bai Lin still hadn't reached Liuyou. Liuyou looked at Bai Lin's skull with empty eyes and said, "...How many times did I tell you? You would fail."

"..."

"Your powers are sealed, so you can't even use your spiritual speech. It's a pathetic sight."

"..."

"How foolish. Why didn't you just stay still? Why don't you say something like you usually do? Like, did you sleep well, or today will definitely work. Try saying it again."

"..."

"In the end, I was right. Just staying still is the best policy. A hole was made, but this is the end, isn't it? Your body is just shattered for nothing. It's ridiculous."

"..."

"...Say something."

Buzz- The circuit drawn on Bai Lin's skull buzzed. It seemed like he was trying to say something to her. But the sound was too small to be heard.

"...Well, after ramming your head so much, that circuit must be broken. When you were bragging about it being a gift from the Cult Leader, now it's in tatters. What will you do now that you can't even say what you want to say? Ha! Really..."

Liuyou looked at Bai Lin for a moment and then laughed hollowly.

"...It's finally quiet. Do you know how noisy it was? Ah~ It's peaceful. Without that noisy clang clang and crackling sound, I can finally sleep comfortably."

She lay down and closed her eyes. Bai Lin just watched her quietly. And three days passed.

Clang, clang, clang! Liuyou started striking the bars. She gritted her teeth.

"Why! After coming this far! After making it this far! Why did you stop there!"

Bai Lin silently watched her.

"After making a hole! If you just did a little more! Somehow! What you were trying to do could have been completed! But why did you stop there!"

Thud! Blood burst from her hand. Due to not inheriting much dragon blood, her skin was as delicate as a carp's. But Liuyou continued to strike the bars even as blood burst out. She had been hearing it for decades. Maybe her ears were itching after not hearing it for just three days. For the first time in her life, or more precisely, for the first time since she followed Liuyou out of the Penglai Kingdom, she shouted sincerely, not as a swindler.

"Let me hear your voice! Why! Did you foolishly break your jaw so you can't speak!"

Clang! Sixty years passed. Finally, or perhaps only now, Liuyou, after striking the bars until her hands were worn out, managed to connect her cell with Bai Lin's. Creak... She stepped into Bai Lin's cell. She could no longer use her hands.

"...Are you satisfied now?"

Liuyou asked as she pulled Bai Lin's skull closer. She brought her forehead to Bai Lin's skull and listened. Buzz, buzz- Bai Lin's skull buzzed. Through the fine circuit drawn on his skull, Liuyou finally heard Bai Lin's voice.

Buzz, buzz- After listening to Bai Lin for a while, Liuyou gritted her teeth.

"...Did you do all this just to say that?"

Buzz- Buzz- After looking at Bai Lin for a while, Liuyou laughed. A tear fell from her face.

"You could have just said good morning like before. That would have been enough."

As she spoke, Liuyou cried, holding Bai Lin's skull.

"You could have just broken your handcuffs, broken the bars, and escaped. That would have been better!"

Though she cried and said that, Liuyou knew the truth. Even if the handcuffs were broken, the seal on their Yuan Ying wouldn't be lifted. Even if the bars were broken, as long as they were in the Dragon Palace, Liuyou could see all their actions, so it was meaningless. Bai Lin had achieved what he wanted within the confines of the bars. To be with Liuyou. And Liuyou knew that too, so she could only cry, holding Bai Lin's skull.

* * *

Four years passed. Boom! Boom! Liuyou, who was sleeping with Bai Lin's skull in her arms, woke up to the sound of the heavens and earth tearing apart. Rumble! The entire Dragon Palace shook. In the tremor, the iron bars of the cell where Liuyou was imprisoned twisted wildly. Clang, clang! With one shake, Liuyou had a chance to escape from the cell. Bai Lin's eyes glowed with ghostly fire. Liuyou listened to Bai Lin's whisper and her eyes sparkled.

"...You're late. Your Cult Leader."

Buzz- Buzz- "You want to escape? Got it."

She took Bai Lin and stepped outside. Creak- As she climbed out of the underground prison, she squinted her eyes. The entire Dragon Palace's seal was shaking, and countless officials of the palace were in a panic. It was the perfect time to escape. But instead of escaping outside, Liuyou headed deeper into the Dragon Palace.

Buzz- Buzz- "Where am I going? Isn't it obvious?"

A fierce determination burned in Liuyou's eyes.

"My nature is that of a thief. I'm going to steal what my father cherishes the most."

Boom, boom! Amid the bombardment of the Dragon Palace by the Demon Sea Pirates, Liuyou and Bai Lin walked towards somewhere.
