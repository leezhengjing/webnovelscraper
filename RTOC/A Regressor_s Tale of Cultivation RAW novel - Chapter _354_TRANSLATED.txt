The Demonic Sect (6)

Sizzle! As I opened my eyes, I saw the 'remnant' glaring at me. Sizzle... I transformed my body into a human shape and looked at the remnant. "They called it a believer."

The true cultivators seemed to refer to those who were eroded by them as 'believers.' "Who decided they were believers?" They were merely pitiful victims who happened to look at the sky and accidentally met their gaze. Who would willingly become like this?

Buzz— I grabbed the Chongtian Sword. I hesitated to cut it down earlier, but not anymore. —Cut. "Cut." The Chongtian Sword and my will aligned. I raised the sword and elevated the Chongtian Sword to a higher level. A pure downward slash. From a high level to a low level. From a high position to a low position! Danak Sword Technique. Mountain Heart Abyss Slash!

Whoosh! Slash! I cut down the true cultivator's believer who was glaring at me. The believer, who was about 30 feet tall, was split in half by the Mountain Heart Abyss Slash and began to scatter. The ominous feeling I had earlier was just a foreboding about the true cultivator behind the believer. But now, after seeing the [Reverse Origin Horn], there was no reason to be afraid.

Sizzle— The dozens of heads attached to the true cultivator's believer's body melted away at once. The black body scattered into pieces and flew everywhere. Suddenly, I saw an old woman in black clothes bowing slightly to me from within the scene.

—Thank you. Her will was conveyed to me. I just nodded in response. Sizzle— As she disappeared, all the mycelium that had covered this desert area turned to ash and vanished. And in the distance, I saw Jeon Myeonghun and Oh Hyunseok walking towards me, carrying four disciples of the Golden Thunder Sect in the air.

"We saved the disciples, but... did you get rid of that thing?" I nodded and looked at the disciples they had saved. Mushrooms shaped like skulls were growing all over their bodies, but the mushrooms soon turned to ash and scattered.

"These guys went to the Netherworld Realm?" "Yes. They were influenced by the true cultivator who eroded them and were lying in this state. I burned all the poison inside them with the Heavenly Tribulation, but they won't wake up for a few days due to the lack of vital energy." "We should leave them to Hongbeom."

I gently stroked the heads of the sleeping disciples. 'Finally...' We succeeded in saving all the survivors of the Golden Thunder Sect. It was a long and arduous journey. I closed my eyes. Hong Suryung came to mind. "...For now..."

I opened my eyes again. Rumble! I gathered my demonic energy and transformed into the Demon King again. "Summon all the Four Great Protectors and the Guardian Demon Kings." Boom! Jeon Myeonghun turned into lightning and flew to the distant Light and Sound Realm. After a while, he returned with the Four Great Protectors and the now thirteen Guardian Demon Kings, including Baekrin.

I spoke, radiating demonic energy. I looked around at everyone gathered here. Jeon Myeonghun, Oh Hyunseok, Kim Yeon, Hongbeom. And the thirteen Guardian Demon Kings. They were all my precious connections. My words stirred the emotions of everyone gathered here. I quickly continued speaking to prevent their fear and worry from spreading.

However, no one moved. Wishihon laughed heartily. "Haha, the Cult Leader told the followers to leave the White Sound Realm if they couldn't be trusted, but in the end, we overcame all the hardships and escaped, didn't we? Those who left the Infinite Sect must be regretting it now."

He continued, "The Cult Leader must have something to believe in to say such things, right?" I smiled bitterly at his words. Buzz— I showed my realm through my demonic energy. And I explained about the 'shortcut.' They looked at each other. Wishihon stroked his chin and said, "Indeed, our demonic beings are best trained in the Netherworld Realm."

"But what we fear the most is... the power of the Netherworld." He grinned. "And the 'physical body' that can avoid the power of the Netherworld is very precious to us, something we don't trade even among family. Yet, the Cult Leader provided us with such 'physical bodies' for free. We even became stronger step by step through 'surgery' and 'grace,' so honestly, we can't express our gratitude enough."

"Who would dare to leave the sect before repaying this grace?" "As long as the recipient is happy, isn't that enough? Haha, we also received it as we pleased and intend to stay in the sect as we please...."

Thud, thud, thud, thud! All the Guardian Demon Kings, even Baekrin, who had just joined and received surgery and grace, knelt down. "Please accept us!" I trembled slightly as I looked at them. I smiled faintly. At my words, everyone responded loudly in unison. "Yes!" I put away my smile and shouted with a serious face. "Yes!" "Yes!" "Yes!" "Yes!"

Rumble! The Protectors and Demon Kings began to land the Light and Sound Realm on this land, and I watched the magnificent scene from below with shining eyes. 'All the forces of the Netherworld Realm will come here. I tried to get along with the Black Bone Palace, but if the true cultivators are influencing the Black Bone Palace, it's meaningless. I'm sorry, Yu Hye, but I can't send you for now.'

We have now truly become the public enemy of the Netherworld Realm. Not just the three major forces, but even the Flower Path Western Palace will join. And if they previously sent a few combined-stage commanders to subdue the sect, from now on, they will designate the entire Infinite Sect as a 'public enemy' and attack.

If the true cultivators, who have lived for countless years and taken root in the Netherworld Realm, move their forces, the result is obvious. 'They will come at us with all their might!' Before they swarm in, we must build up our strength as quickly as possible and open the shortcut to return to the Guanghan Realm. 'This time, for sure...!' I won't let my comrades die easily.

Hamjin sat down and took a deep breath, reminiscing about the past. He was just an ordinary beggar born in the remote Yuha Kingdom on the edge of the Pyeongun Continent. Born in the outskirts of the Yuha Kingdom, he had no big dreams and just hoped to grow up enough to work. But that dream was shattered when a band of thieves attacked the village.

However, Hamjin slightly adjusted his goal. His life was worthless anyway, so changing his goal a bit wouldn't kill him. Hamjin thought as he was sold to a slave trader. He hoped to meet a decent master and live while working. And Hamjin was sold to a monk. That monk was a vicious monk who practiced demonic cultivation. Hamjin's goal was shattered again. But he didn't give up and adjusted his goal once more.

He thought as he was experimented on by the self-proclaimed master. He hoped to survive the experiments and return to his hometown, even as a test subject. And Hamjin's goal was shattered again. Because he saw the books and research journals his master had been studying while his master was away. His master planned to modify his disciples and create a body most suitable for demonic cultivation to 'transfer' into. And at this point, there were 40 surviving disciples. Among them, Hamjin was one of the 'top-tier' bodies for his master.

It didn't matter that his cultivation was only at the first or second star of the Refining Stage. He learned for the first time that he had a unique constitution called the Ghost Furnace Body. The Ghost Furnace Body was said to be easy to connect with great beings from the upper realms, easily gain their favor, and be optimized for borrowing their power. His master seemed to want to borrow power from a great being in the upper realms and eventually ascend. That's why he was targeting Hamjin's body.

The moment he learned this, Hamjin's goal changed again. 'I want to live!' This time, it wasn't 'just enough.' He 'really' wanted to live. His life had been worthless, but even so, it was too unfair to die without achieving anything. 'I will live! I will survive!' From that day on, Hamjin secretly read his master's books. And he learned how to communicate with great beings from the upper realms.

'If my constitution is suitable for borrowing power through rituals, then I should use it.' So Hamjin chose a book called the 'Infinite Demon King Ritual Book' from his master's library and performed the ritual while his master was away. And he encountered a 'great being.' That being demanded something unusual from Hamjin, took over his body, ascended to the sky, looked around, and then returned when Hamjin couldn't hold on any longer. And as a reward for taking over his body, the being granted him a unique 'sense.'

Buzz— Hamjin opened his eyes. Countless yin and yang energies were swirling around him. The great being had said to meet again in three months. Hamjin was terrified of that being! A demon king with 19 faces, shedding bloody tears, and cultivating a field of curses! A terrifying being that sometimes appeared in his dreams. Hamjin gritted his teeth. Even so, that being was better than his master, who wanted to take over his life completely.

"Oh, great one...." Hamjin prayed to the being while his master was away. "Please descend upon me." Rumble! He fell into a white space. It was a familiar place. Inside his mental world. And he saw the shadow with 19 heads entering the white space, and he knelt with a trembling heart. "Oh, great one, what do you desire from me?"

Hamjin had felt it since last time, that the being wanted to do something through him. 'Originally, such beings grant wishes in exchange for something precious or lifespan. But if they want something from me....' He might not have to give up his lifespan! Whether the being knew his thoughts or not, the shadow with 19 heads looked at Hamjin and asked. "Yes? Ah, yes! I am using it very well."

It was true. Even though it was a sense given by an evil being, Hamjin was using it very effectively. The reason Hamjin could read the Infinite Demon King Ritual Book from his master's library was simple. While his master was experimenting in the research room next to the library, one of the test subjects exploded, destroying not only the research room but also the barrier around the library. Hamjin took advantage of the broken barrier to secretly take out the ritual book. But after gaining this sense, he didn't have to wait for such coincidences.

He could sense the heavenly and earthly energies so clearly! He could predict how the barrier was set up and which part would trigger an alarm. He read the heavenly and earthly energies to avoid the barrier and entered his master's library almost every day. He didn't have to worry about being watched or his master suddenly entering the library. The heavenly and earthly energies warned him of danger! He just had to keep sensing the heavenly and earthly energies! He even boldly raided his master's elixir storage once or twice. Thanks to that, Hamjin's cultivation rapidly increased, reaching the third star of the Refining Stage.

"It was really, really helpful. I am deeply grateful for the precious help." Shiver! Hamjin felt a chill run down his spine at the terrifying being's voice. He feared that the being might say, 'You're well-cooked!' and devour him at any moment. But Hamjin swallowed his fear and waited for the being's next words. The shadow laughed for a while and then spoke. The shadow with 38 eyes lit up and spoke. Rumble! The shadow clenched its hand. Hamjin's mental world began to shake violently. No, it wasn't just that. Hamjin realized that the 'outside' was shaking as well. The being's mere clenching of its hand caused an earthquake in the entire valley!

"What can I do to help you?" The great being slightly bowed its head towards Hamjin. Rumble! That alone made his mental world seem to darken. "...!" Hamjin was shocked and opened his mouth. 'If it's the Original Spirit Stage....' His master was only at the Middle Severing Stage! His master gritted his teeth, hoping to reach the Great Severing Stage, let alone the Original Spirit Stage. So when Hamjin heard the term Original Spirit Stage, his mind went blank. Fortunately, the Severing Stage was something Hamjin could look up to, even if it was far beyond his reach. But it was still daunting.

"I apologize, great one. To reach the Severing Stage, I would have to cultivate tirelessly for the next 200 years. And my master plans to take my body in a few years...!" His eyes trembled with fear. Suddenly, the worst outcome flashed in his mind. His master, who was at the Severing Stage, would take over Hamjin's body, transplant the forbidden techniques from his original body into Hamjin's body, and immediately seek the Severing Stage. In that case, the being would be satisfied with the power it could draw from Hamjin's body, and his master would be satisfied with borrowing the power of the great being! In the end, the only one who would suffer was Hamjin, who was only at the third star of the Refining Stage!

As he broke into a cold sweat, the great being spoke in a gentle voice. "Then...." The shadow with 38 eyes burning with demonic energy rested one of its heads on its hand and looked at Hamjin for a moment. The shadow laughed. "Yes...!?" Hamjin's eyes widened in disbelief at the absurd suggestion. The Foundation Building Stage was not something one could reach through mere play! But the being spoke as if it were offering him breakfast, so casually.

"Didn't you say you had to lift the valley to obtain it?" The shadow laughed. After hearing the shadow's proposal, Hamjin thought hard. And he realized. No matter how much he thought about it, there was no better proposal. And without borrowing the being's power, he would inevitably lose his body and die. There was no better proposal! And he had no choice but to grab this rotten lifeline. 'I can't be picky.'

Finally, Hamjin made up his mind and spoke with a determined expression. "Yes, I understand. I will follow the great one's words!" Whisper, whisper, whisper.... Hamjin communicated with the great being and received the knowledge it bestowed upon him.

* * *

Thud! "Tsk, this test subject is dead too." In the Yuha Kingdom, there were beings known as the 'Three Great Sages.' They were legendary cultivators at the Severing Stage, and among them, the strongest in demonic cultivation was the Black Ridge Old Monster, Yeomgok! He looked at the dead test subject with a displeased expression and suddenly smashed the altar with his fist. "Damn it! Another failure! Why are my disciples so weak? How can they become my useful body like this?"

His angry roar echoed throughout the entire Severing Valley. His disciples, who were only at the Refining Stage, trembled in fear within the Severing Valley. "Damn it, damn it, damn it! There are only 39 left! Why are there no promising ones among them!?" Yeomgok bit his lips and tore at his hair. Unable to contain his anger, he burned the dead test subject's body and shouted. "Gather in front of me immediately! You useless things!"

At his words, his disciples quickly gathered in front of Yeomgok's research room. Yeomgok looked around at his disciples. Except for two who had reached the sixth star of the Refining Stage, the rest were either at the first or second star, and some hadn't even properly reached the Foundation Building Stage. "You useless things! Why weren't you born with useful talents? Why!? Your worthless lives are only valuable when they extend the life of a sage like me!!!"

Boom, boom! He threw things from the research room at the disciples below the Foundation Building Stage and shouted. Even after that, he didn't calm down and started beating the disciples at the first and second stars of the Refining Stage. After a while, only three disciples remained unscathed in his research room. The sixth star Refining Stage disciples, Wije and Yuin, and the third star Refining Stage disciple, Hamjin.

Looking at Wije and Yuin, Yeomgok spoke with bloodshot eyes. "You should be ready for the Seven Star Ritual by now, right? If you're not ready today, I'll grind you into elixirs!" The two disciples trembled and nodded. "Yes, yes, Master! We have fully reached the sixth star. We just need to perform the Seven Star Ritual!" "Me too!" "Hmph! Stupid fools...." He looked at them with displeased eyes and finally turned to Hamjin.

"Hmm...." He slowly approached Hamjin, touched his body, and checked his teeth. "Good... very healthy. Have you been brushing your teeth well?" "Yes, yes. Thanks to the good salt you provided last time, I brush them clean every day and use fragrant oil to make them smell good." "Good, you must be used to bathing by now, and you're exercising diligently, right?" "Yes. I think I'm starting to build muscle." "Haha, very good. Very good. And let's see... Oh, amazing. You've already reached the mid-third star of the Refining Stage?" "Yes...." "Haha! Excellent. But as I said many times, don't just focus on cultivation. Go outside, get some sunlight, and do your best to build a healthy and sound body." "...Understood."

Yeomgok patted Hamjin's head with a kind expression. It was an attitude that anyone would think was treating a cherished disciple. But no one in this place envied or looked at Hamjin with jealousy. Instead, everyone looked at Hamjin with pity whenever Yeomgok treated him like a precious object. None of Yeomgok's disciples were unaware that Hamjin was half-chosen as the target for Yeomgok's body transfer technique.

"Now. I have to go out to gather materials, so clean the research room thoroughly while I'm gone." Yeomgok patted Hamjin and left the research room without looking at the other disciples. He used the flying technique to leave the valley. '...Hamjin has been acting strange since the earthquake.' Yeomgok frowned. A few months ago, a big earthquake occurred in the Severing Valley. Because of that, several materials Yeomgok had painstakingly obtained were lost, and he had to rage. But the problem was that Hamjin had been acting slightly strange since the earthquake.

Previously, Hamjin had sneaked into Yeomgok's library several times to read books. Of course, Yeomgok knew but let it slide. After all, Hamjin's body would be his in a few years. But after the earthquake, Hamjin never sneaked into the library again. The multiple layers
