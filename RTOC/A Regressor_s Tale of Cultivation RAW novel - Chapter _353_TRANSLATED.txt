### Demonic Sect (5)

I stood above the Guangyin Territory, gazing at the desolate land far in the distance. This was the starting point of the Nankye region, where the disciples of the Jinshentianlei Sect had entered. An endless, lifeless desert stretched out before me. Such barren lands were quite common in the Minggui Realm. While it was difficult for life to take root here, it was an ideal place for certain ghostly creatures with specific attributes to reside. However, I sensed that this desert was fundamentally different from those places.

"Even ghostly creatures... are nowhere to be seen."

It was too desolate. In the Minggui Realm, ghostly creatures were usually everywhere. There were intelligent ghostly creatures, but there were also many mindless wraiths. Especially those wraiths, which took on all sorts of forms and were scattered throughout the Minggui Realm. But here, there were none. Not even the common wraiths were visible. All I could see was the endlessly sprawling desolate land. And...

*Crack, crack, crack...*

In the middle of the desolate land, there lay a solitary 'skull of someone.' As I looked at the skull, I realized that it was the remains of a monk who had been eroded by a True Immortal.

*Whoosh— Boom!*

I quickly flew down and landed in front of the skull.

"This is..."

Upon closer inspection, it was not just a simple skull. The skull, which kept moving its mouth as if it were alive, was quite a creepy sight. However, upon sensing the true nature of the skull, I realized that it was in a far more horrifying state than it appeared.

*Crack!*

I grabbed the skull and pulled it out of the ground. As I pulled it further, a body resembling a spine followed, and as I pulled out more, hundreds of disgusting fiber-like tendrils sprouted from the spine and began to emerge. Although I had roughly confirmed it with my consciousness before landing, it was still disgusting.

The monk who had been eroded by the True Immortal was originally an ordinary ghostly creature. But over time, its body gradually transformed into these mushroom-like mycelia, taking root beneath this land.

*Whoosh—*

I observed the land beneath with my consciousness. An enormous amount of mycelia was writhing beneath the ground. There were so many mycelia that it was impossible to count them in thousands or millions.

"The further north we go, the more clusters of mycelia there are."

Recognizing the mycelia that had eroded the land, I looked into the distance.

"Did the remains of the eroded one extend from that far place to here, blooming into these mycelia?"

I looked at the skull, which was still chattering even after being pulled out of the ground. The skull showed no reaction, even as it witnessed my death.

"Is it because it's already an eroded body and doesn't care?"

I tried stimulating it with ghostly energy, human energy, and spiritual energy. However, the skull mushroom continued to chatter its teeth and wriggle in my hand, unaffected.

It was then.

*Wriggle, wriggle—*

The skull mushroom began to release mycelia onto my hand. The mycelia burrowed into my hand, spreading roots inside.

"Amazing. Even though I was drawing upon the Changryeongseonggwang Five-Color Technique, it just pierced through this solid body."

I marveled for a moment and tried to expel the mycelia eroding my arm. However, none of the techniques I had learned could drive out the mycelia.

"Tsk... Should I just cut it off?"

As I clicked my tongue inwardly, I used my last resort. The mycelia flinched and reacted to the power I used. It was the mist of the Mansanginyondo. Additionally, the mycelia reacted to the power of the Chongcheongeom. Perhaps because the Chongcheongeom was imbued with the energy of the Heavenly Tribulation, the mycelia died upon contact with its power and retreated from inside my hand.

*Whoosh—*

Combining the power of the Chongcheongeom and the Mansanginyondo, I quickly expelled the mycelia from my hand and shattered the skull mushroom I was holding.

*Crack!*

The skull mushroom touched by the Chongcheongeom turned to ash and scattered beneath my hand.

*Crackle!*

Jeon Myeonghun flew to my side and asked, "Did you find out anything about this land?"

I nodded and explained.

"I see. Got it."

Jeon Myeonghun and I returned to the Guangyin Territory.

*Rumble—*

I sent a signal to depart from above the barrier of the Guangyin Territory, and the Guangyin Territory began to move northward. Simultaneously, Jeon Myeonghun transformed into a six-armed giant at the northern end of the Guangyin Territory, took out a six-colored flag, and began to wave it wildly.

*Boom, boom!*

The colorful lightning bolts gathered in the air and merged into a single red bolt. Jeon Myeonghun chanted towards the red lightning sphere in front of him. The lightning sphere exploded, and lightning with an aura similar to the Heavenly Tribulation spread out like a curtain in front of the Guangyin Territory.

*Crackle!*

The Guangyin Territory advanced, erasing the mycelia beneath the ground as it moved forward.

*Whoosh—*

I focused my mind, enveloping the Guangyin Territory with my consciousness, observing for any potential incidents. And when the massive body of the Guangyin Territory entered the desert...

*Rumble!*

The entire land trembled, and the mycelia writhing beneath the ground simultaneously released spores.

"When Jeon Myeonghun and I entered, there was no reaction, but now that a big prey has entered, they are reacting."

But it was useless.

*Whoosh—*

For the Sim Clan, the consciousness domain is both power and authority. Their manifestations are mostly based on the consciousness domain. However, the consciousness domain they first acquire rarely changes. Kim Yeonghun and Jang Ikdo also used the consciousness domain they obtained at the level of the Five Great Masters to perform various feats and defeat monks with consciousness domains that could cover the heavens and the earth.

But I possessed the power of the Sim Clan and the consciousness domain of the Cheonji Clan. My consciousness domain could cover the entire Guangyin Territory and more!

*Rumble!*

My consciousness surrounding the Guangyin Territory became a storm. The invisible storm swirled in all colors, repelling every single spore. The repelled spores turned to ash and fell into the desert, and we traversed the vast and desolate desert.

* * *

About a month had passed. How far had we traveled across the vast desert?

"Is that it?"

We finally reached the source of the mycelia that covered this entire area. We succeeded in approaching the remains of the eroded monk.

*Crackle!*

Jeon Myeonghun roared, releasing red lightning from his six arms. The storm of red lightning swept away all the mycelia in all directions.

*Crackle!*

After clearing the mycelia, Jeon Myeonghun set up a barrier of red lightning around the entire Guangyin Territory and looked at me. I nodded. Jeon Myeonghun, Oh Hyeonseok, and I stepped out of the Guangyin Territory and walked towards the eroded remains.

In the case of Oh Hyeonseok, it had been revealed over the past month that spores were absorbed upon contact with his purple aura, so I thought it would be fine to bring him along.

It was a massive remnant. I clicked my tongue as I looked at the enormous remnant before me. This remnant was clearly still 'alive.' Jeon Myeonghun clicked his tongue and looked back and forth between the remnant and me.

"It looks quite similar. No wonder you, who resemble this thing, are called the leader of the Demonic Sect."

Though I didn't want to admit it, the remains of the monk eroded by the True Immortal looked exactly like me. The thing at the center of the mycelia, supplying them with power, had a pitch-black body, and white skulls sprouted from between the black body parts. Even when observed with the Minggak, it had a bizarre appearance with death overlapping in several places. Truly, it resembled my appearance quite a bit.

"Tsk, no wonder it's called the Demonic Sect."

"Then, Hyeonseok and I will look around and search for the disciples of the sect."

Jeon Myeonghun and Oh Hyeonseok began to search the surroundings, leaving the massive remnant, about 30 meters in size, behind. I clicked my tongue and looked at the thing before me with pity.

"That aside... it seems to be still alive, quite miserably."

Each of the skulls exuded emotions. Those emotions intertwined to form a single consciousness domain. Indeed, this remnant, despite its horrific state, was still alive.

"Is it dreaming?"

Eroded by the gaze of a True Immortal, dreaming a long dream, and eroding this land. Did this being become like this willingly?

*Whoosh—*

I drew the Chongcheongeom and pondered.

"Can I cut it?"

But after a moment of contemplation, I sheathed the Chongcheongeom again.

"I can't cut it."

Attempting to cut it might be possible. However, I felt an ominous premonition from within the remnant, preventing me from extending the Chongcheongeom. I had a feeling that recklessly cutting it would lead to significant trouble.

"I found them! They're here!"

Jeon Myeonghun's voice echoed from afar. I nodded and started walking towards him. It was then.

*Shiver!*

A sinister feeling licked my spine. I quickly turned my head and raised the Chongcheongeom. What I saw was the remnant, with 'eyes' made of white light forming inside the eye sockets. The remnant, with dozens of heads, had eyes forming inside the eye sockets, staring at 'me.'

I tried to retreat quickly, but the surroundings changed in an instant.

*Crack, crackle!*

The surroundings shattered, and I found myself floating in the night sky. When I looked down, blood burst from 38 eye sockets.

*Splatter!*

A woman! I seemed to see a 'woman' with her limbs grotesquely twisted and holes pierced all over her body. I gritted my teeth as my head felt like it was swelling.

"What did I just see?"

Unable to stand, I collapsed to the ground, barely regaining my senses.

"Don't look down..."

It was then.

*Crack!*

Suddenly, an overwhelming force pressed down on me, causing me to bow my head and fall to the ground as if performing a full-body prostration. There was a transparent barrier, so I didn't fall, but the bottom was still visible!

"No, don't...! If I look down...!"

And then, there was nothing below. The woman I had seen earlier was gone. There was only a 'world' so vast that just perceiving it made my head ache. Indeed, what lay below was the entire Minggui Realm.

"What? I thought I saw a woman just now..."

I squinted my eyes and extended my consciousness to identify who had forced my head down. But there was nothing within thousands of miles. The night sky was filled with stars, illuminating the darkness...

*Shiver!*

I finally understood where I had suddenly arrived.

"Crazy... Could this be...!"

Above the Minggui Realm. No, even higher. Outside the dimension of the Minggui Realm!

As soon as I realized this, a majestic voice echoed in my mind.

"...!!!"

I could feel it. Dozens of 'gazes' were piercing into my body!

"Damn it, can True Immortals summon beings from within the Minggui Realm to the outside of the dimension!?"

Various thoughts crossed my mind, but I decided to respond to the voice that had just echoed in my mind.

*Crackle!*

My jaw shattered instantly, preventing me from speaking. No, I couldn't even project my 'will' outward. It was as if 'speech' itself had been sealed. Terrifying gazes pierced through my body. The True Immortals continued to speak to someone they mistakenly thought was behind me.

*Rumble!*

The more they spoke, the more my entire body felt like it was being crushed. And then, I reached out my hand.

*Crack, crackle!*

I stood up. It felt like the cosmic force was trying to crush my body, but I endured. Somehow, I felt like I could 'do it.' I looked around, piercing through the countless voices. Countless stars. And 'gazes' pretending to be stars. About fifty of them. Yes, fifty True Immortals were sending stern gazes at me.

*Crack, crackle!*

I tried to draw upon the Samtaegeuk or the Circuit, but I realized it was impossible.

"I see."

I understood what the True Immortals had done.

"They didn't bring me here. They temporarily pulled my consciousness outside the dimension. My body is still down there."

I shone my eyes. And with all my might, I pushed my mental image, and the 'something' suppressed within it.

*Rumble, rumble!*

Just as I had stood up against the True Immortals' pressure, I pulled out my 'speech' that they had sealed.

*Rumble—*

It was difficult to utter a single word. It felt like my entire body would shatter at any moment. But I could endure. Because only my consciousness had been summoned here. Since only my consciousness was here, I couldn't summon the Samtaegeuk or the Circuit, which required the training of the Cheonji Clan, but on the other hand, as long as I had enough mental strength, I could endure!

However, the True Immortals, after a brief murmur, sent their will towards me.

*Crack, crackle!*

What would happen if I called out the name of the Reverse Origin or the Eosun-class? I wanted to do that immediately, but since 'speech' itself was sealed, I could barely express my opinion. Therefore, it was impossible to utter a powerful 'word,' and similarly, I couldn't call out such names or symbols. They ignored me and continued to speak to someone I didn't know behind me. I gritted my teeth. It reminded me of that time. The despair I felt when I faced fifty monks of the Chukgi level. Now, they were cute enough to scratch their bellies, but back then, I felt like an insect. Hiding in a collapsed building, trembling and hiding behind Kim Yeonghun, being treated like an insect. It felt like I had returned to that time. The situation was similar. Back then, the elders of the Makrise family didn't care about me and were focused on chasing Kim Yeonghun, and the True Immortals were the same now.

*Crack!*

A tremendous pressure pressed down on me. But I didn't bow my head to the ground, even as I faced the cosmic force. Everything was the same as back then. But there was something different.

*Rumble—*

I gathered my will.

*Whoosh!*

I raised my head. Focusing all my will, I brought 'speech' to my throat.

*Rumble—*

Anger. A tremendous anger filled the sky. The True Immortals were furious. The situation was the same as in the past, but what had changed? It was that I had constantly trained my will and desire through several lives! Now, even if my mouth tore apart, I would say what I needed to say! Through the Chongcheongeom, I converted my mental power in the realm of the soul to the realm of energy. The power of the Five Elements and the power of Yin and Yang covered my entire body.

*Whoosh!*

Light swirled in my hands. It wasn't just the Taesan Yeolje Gong. I imprinted the shape of [what I had seen] inside it! As I scattered the Taesan Yeolje towards the sky, I showed them the [Reverse Origin].

――――――――!

――!!!!

――――――!!

――――――――!!!!

Incomprehensible screams shook the universe. No, their shouts seemed to shake the entire Minggui Realm below.

*Rumble!*

A True Immortal with an angry voice shouted wildly.

*Whoosh—*

Feeling the angry voice, I smirked.

*Crack, crackle!*

I shed my ghostly body. My human form was revealed. As a human, Seo Eunhyun, I looked up at the sky and spoke.

"You're talking nonsense. Isn't that what you've been doing all along?"

Great ghost, demonic sect leader, evil cult—I've heard it all before. For the past 200 years, I've been spreading the teachings, doing volunteer work, and bringing benefits everywhere. I even avoided going outside the Mugeukgyojeon to prevent people from fearing my appearance. Yet, all the forces opposed me and called me a public enemy. 200 years is not a short time, and wanting to be seen favorably by someone during that time is not a simple matter. It's natural to open up to each other as much as the time invested. But strangely, everyone was caught in bizarre misunderstandings until they saw the cult with their own eyes. Is all this a coincidence? I've been toyed with by fate several times. Do you think I can't feel the sense of fate now!?

"You've been distorting our information and twisting our perception, spreading it throughout the Minggui Realm. You've been suppressing us for 200 years, preventing us from spreading everywhere by touching the realm of names! And now, when I ask for a proper conversation, you act like you're doing me a favor by growling!"

Shouting towards the True Immortals, who were writhing madly after seeing the Reverse Origin, I smirked. I had already found a way to return to the Minggui Realm. And now, I had found it.

"Farewell, I'm leaving now."

I already knew. These guys couldn't interfere with the Middle Realm due to their promise with Hyeol-eum. I heard it directly from Hyeon-eum, so it must be true. Even if these guys talked to the being behind me for a hundred days, that being didn't exist, so they would eventually think they were being ignored and try to kill me. In that case, it was better to kick their butts and leave.

"Lord of the Underworld, Judge of Reincarnation, Mingguijin-gun Yusuryeon! Please let me back in!"

――――――――!

――――!!!

――!!!!!!!!!

――――――――――!!!

The True Immortals went berserk again. I also felt a shock as if my soul was collapsing. But high-level information is more dangerous to higher beings, so they must have been more shocked. And anyway.

*Rumble!*

"Then, goodbye!"

*Flash!*

The surroundings brightened as if they were glowing white, and I returned to the inside of the Minggui Realm.

* * *

*Rumble!*

The cosmic space
