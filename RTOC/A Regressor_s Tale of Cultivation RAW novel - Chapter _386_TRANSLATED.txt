**Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 386: Salt (2)**

**High Power Realm, Weizheng Sea. Zhenglong Palace.**

Beneath it lies the deep-sea island of Yinglong Island. There, the half-human, half-fish tribe member, Weiyun, took a deep breath.

“Phew… Damn it.”

Having transformed into a member of the Yuan Spirit Fish Tribe, she could now take on a fully human form. She trembled as she looked up at the sea dragon statue before her. Her head was spinning. She had lost count of how many times she had done this.

‘But I have to do it.’

Weiyun bit her lip as she recalled her village burning at the hands of ghosts on Zhenglong Island.

Crack!

She drew her own blood and offered it to the sea dragon statue. The statue absorbed her blood and life force. Its eyes lit up.

“More power…! Give me more power!”

A dark red aura emanated from the statue and was absorbed into Weiyun’s body. She absorbed the dark red demonic energy. Her eyes turned black, and her pupils glowed red. Her cultivation level, which was at the early stage of Yuan Spirit, soared to the mid-stage.

“…This can’t be.”

Weiyun closed her eyes tightly. For a hundred years, she had been practicing demonic arts on Yinglong Island to save her parents. By offering her blood and life force to the sea dragon statue, it granted her immense power and a rise in cultivation level. But the statue demanded more than just that.

“Do not ask for a blood sacrifice. I will carry out your orders. Please give me your command.”

Occasionally, the sea dragon statue would give Weiyun tasks, mostly to eliminate members of the Wujig Sect or ambush its key figures. Completing these tasks was treated as equivalent to offering a blood sacrifice, and the statue would grant her power. These were tasks Weiyun had always desired, so she performed them gladly, achieving rapid cultivation progress over the past century.

‘Just a little more, and I can break through the ghostly creatures guarding Zhenglong Island and rescue my parents from their labor in the central area!’

“Give me a mission!”

At that moment, the sea dragon statue emitted a red light, and a large amount of demonic energy flowed into Weiyun’s body.

“Huh, what?”

While she was bewildered, her cultivation level forcibly skyrocketed.

Rumble!

Her cultivation, which was at the mid-stage of Yuan Spirit, surged to the peak stage. Despite feeling her life force being drained and her Yuan Spirit shaking, she laughed.

‘With this level of cultivation…’

The day to rescue her parents was near! As she rejoiced, a voice came from the sea dragon statue.

“Thank you!”

Weiyun bowed deeply to the statue, then staggered out of Yinglong Island, intoxicated by the demonic energy.

Stumble, stumble…

Cough!

Weiyun coughed, and blood mixed with her saliva.

‘I probably… won’t live long.’

The price of her rapid cultivation rise was a significant reduction in her lifespan.

‘But it’s okay… as long as I can save my parents…’

Her long-awaited goal was now within reach. She staggered through a large cave, heading towards the entrance that led to the sea surface from Yinglong Island. The cave walls she passed were adorned with murals. They depicted a massive dark red entity fighting a dragon. In the subsequent murals, the dark red entity was decapitated by an axe-like weapon wielded by the dragon, but inexplicably, the axe also struck the dragon’s neck, causing it to die on some land. Despite losing part of its body to the axe, the dark red entity did not die and reached out to grab something from the dragon. A small black worm was created by the dark red entity. The black worm created another worm identical to itself and threw it somewhere. The worm, resembling the black worm, settled in a place depicted with countless ocean waves, scattering tiny objects beneath the sea. Under the sea were stars, moons, suns, human fingers, thighs, some beast’s horns, livers, body parts, or someone’s head. The mural ended there.

Weiyun passed through the cave and ascended to the sea surface.

“…Anyway, Father will soon come to his senses,” continued Liuyou. “He values himself greatly. Moreover, since his sane self exists outside, he will quickly regain his identity by synchronizing his mind here with his mind outside.”

I wore a cold expression.

“…Should I just cut off his head?”

Whether he regained his senses or not, as long as he stayed close to the ground, I was confident I could cut off his head.

“I’m not sure if that will work…”

“…Alright. You’re saying he might have another trick up his sleeve?”

“…Yes. I’m sorry, but this is all I know, so I can’t tell you more.”

“It’s fine. I’ll try what I can. But are you okay with this?”

“What do you mean?”

“I’m going to kill your father.”

At my words, Liuyou made a bitter expression, then a resolute one.

“Please kill him.”

“……”

“He betrayed my siblings, my mother, and this world. If we don’t kill him, it would be a disservice to all those who died or were deceived by him.”

“…Understood. Then, from today, I will use more forceful methods to take over Fenglai Kingdom and ascend the throne. We need to be on the throne to resist him. Is that okay?”

“As long as you don’t kill the royal family, it’s fine.”

“Got it.”

I nodded and spoke to Seran.

“Let Liuyou rest.”

“Yes, follow me for a moment.”

Seran led Liuyou to the best house in Taeeul Village, Nolbu’s house. I fell into thought.

‘Yuklin… So, is he also practicing the Dark Soul Technique?’

I didn’t think so. I didn’t feel the same insidious, endless malice I felt when infected by Seohul’s Dark Soul Technique. Besides, Yuklin didn’t seem capable of the mental disintegration torture that Seohul could perform. As I pondered the connection between Yuklin and Seohul, a scream rang out.

“…Kyaaaah!!!”

“…?”

Startled, I ran to Nolbu’s house and saw a shocking scene. A sea of blood! Nolbu’s house was a sea of blood. In the middle of it, Yeonwi sat in the main hall, holding a kitchen knife with a vacant look. Blood dripped from her knife. I asked her.

“…What have you done?”

“…Seoeunhyun.”

She spoke with empty eyes.

“…You’ve regained your memory.”

“Yes.”

I looked around Nolbu’s house. The smell of blood was particularly strong in the master bedroom. In one corner, Yeonjin sat in shock, unable to speak.

“So, what have you done?”

“Ah… I matched the situation to reality to avoid going mad in this illusion.”

She looked at me with gloomy eyes and gave a bitter smile. The playful wife of Nolbu, who used to laugh at his apologies, was gone. In her place was an old monster who had gouged out her fiancé’s eyes and harbored a grudge for 40,000 years.

“It was such a sweet dream. But humans can’t live in dreams. They shouldn’t. If they get lost in dreams, they go mad.”

“…But you didn’t have to go this far. Yeonjin is…”

“What’s the problem? Yeonjin will wake up soon. And you…”

Her next words weighed heavily on my heart.

“Do you want me to wake up from this dream and commit suicide in reality?”

“……”

I couldn’t say anything as I looked into her empty eyes. But Liuyou, who was behind me, shouted with tears in her eyes.

“What, what have you done!? These, these are… my people!”

Yeonwi looked at Liuyou as if she were spouting nonsense, and I told her the truth I had learned from Liuyou in a heavy voice. Yeonwi spat out her words.

“Don’t talk nonsense. You’ve gone mad, you carp girl… This world is just an illusion within a formation. You’ve been brainwashed by your father.”

“No, it’s not… These are my people. It’s not just an illusion! You’re the ones… you’re the illusions!”

“Don’t be ridiculous. Are you saying this is real? And we’re fake? That’s insane! Are you saying my 40,000 years are fake!? Say one more word, and I’ll rip out your tongue.”

Yeonwi stood up with the kitchen knife. Even without any spiritual power, her 40,000 years of combat experience were enough to make her threat real. She had always been playful around us, but that was her true nature. I drew my sword and cut her kitchen knife in half.

Ting—

Her knife was cut and embedded in the wall.

“Stop!”

My killing intent neutralized hers. But at Seran’s words, Yeonwi’s eyes turned upside down.

“Please calm down. Can’t you both consider that both might be real? For example… like different possibilities…”

“…Are you saying…”

Crack…

Blood vessels popped in Yeonwi’s eyes.

“Are you saying this is another possibility for me…?”

She clenched her fists. Her nails dug into her flesh, and blood flowed from her hands.

“To live a normal life with Hyeonwon… to raise children… to wake up early and prepare breakfast for him, manage the servants, help with his work, have lunch together, feed our son, hand him to Hyeonwon, welcome visiting relatives, follow Hyeonwon’s words, sometimes get scolded and feel down, laugh like a courtesan when praised or apologized to, have a full dinner, light a warm fire, put our son to bed, and then share the bed with Hyeonwon again… Is that what you’re saying is another possibility for me…?”

“……”

Crack…

Yeonwi gritted her teeth. Blood flowed from her gums.

“Then, if this world is such a possibility, what is the existence that created this world and brought us here? Why? To show me this possibility? To make me more miserable? Huh? Don’t be ridiculous… If this world is real… then this world is pure evil that mocks me completely! Say it again! Is this world an illusion, or is it an evil that endlessly torments us?”

Liuyou tried to say something, but Yeonwi lunged at her, seemingly intent on gouging out her eyes.

“I said stop!!!”

I shouted and swung my sword. Swish! Yeonwi’s neck was cut in one stroke. I exuded killing intent and spoke.

“As the leader of the Wujig Sect and the successor of the founder of the Golden Thunder Sect, Yang Sujin, I command you, Yeonwi, a military officer of the Wujig Sect and a disciple of the Golden Thunder Sect, to take Yeonjin outside and face the wall!”

My killing intent subdued Yeonwi’s. She wore a blank expression and took the mute Yeonjin outside. I spoke to Liuyou.

“Princess Liuyou of Fenglai Kingdom! As the monster king who holds you hostage, I ask you. Do not provoke Yeonwi. Do not impose your thoughts on her.”

“…Understood.”

I straightened my face, settled the situation, and asked Seran to ensure Yeonwi and Liuyou did not meet. Then, I hurried to Jeon Myeonghun’s house.

‘If Yeonwi has regained consciousness… Jeon Myeonghun might have too.’

I quickened my pace, fearing Jeon Myeonghun might be doing the same thing as Yeonwi. In the distance, I saw Jeon Myeonghun’s house. A sense of foreboding filled me.

“Jeon Myeonghun!”

From inside the house, the smell of blood wafted out.
