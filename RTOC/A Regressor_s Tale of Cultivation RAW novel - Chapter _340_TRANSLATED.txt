### The Dead (1)

I gritted my teeth and sighed. "Suddenly, the Underworld? Damn you, Seo Hyul..."

Since Seo Hyul was the cause of all this, I blamed him and ground my teeth. However, I couldn't stay angry forever. I calmed myself and thought about my next steps.

"Since I'm already in the Underworld, there's no choice. Let's aim to return to the Guanghan Realm as soon as possible, find the disciples of the Golden Thunder Sect, and build the Pillar of Longevity."

Since I couldn't change what had already happened, it was best to do what I could here. Before making any plans, I first looked up at the sky to read the celestial signs. I intended to gather information by reading the celestial signs and then act based on that.

"The sky in the Underworld is navy blue..."

Even though it seemed to be daytime, the sky was a dark navy blue, with dozens of brightly shining stars. At that moment, Yeonwi suddenly slapped my cheek in a panic.

Slap!

"You crazy fool! Why are you reading the celestial signs in the Underworld? Close your eyes! Lower your head!"

"Yes, yes?"

I was flustered but did as I was told, closing my eyes and lowering my head.

"What on earth is going on?"

"Damn it, I forgot you had no information about the Underworld and would act recklessly."

Yeonwi, exuding a sense of fear, slowly explained.

"In the Underworld, you must not look at the sky to read the celestial signs. No, to be precise, you can do that at 'night.'"

"...? Is there a reason why you can't read the celestial signs during the day in the Underworld?"

I opened my eyes and asked, puzzled. Yeonwi, with a pale face, used a sound transmission technique to speak, as if afraid someone might hear.

Chills!

I understood what Yeonwi was saying. The information I had heard from Seo Hyul before. Chills, chills! Seo Hyul had mentioned that the True Immortals of the Underworld were observing this world to find a shortcut to the True Immortal Realm.

"The stars in the sky right now are not stars..."

The dozens of True Immortals were the 'gazes' observing this world from beyond the sky of the Underworld.

"If I had kept looking at the sky to read the celestial signs without knowing anything..."

I might have unknowingly become a puppet of the True Immortals.

"...Thank you, Senior Yeon."

I sincerely thanked Yeonwi for the advice. I nodded and conveyed this information to Hongbeom as well.

"What a terrifying place."

"...By the way, why aren't our comrades waking up?"

I looked at my comrades who were still unconscious. The shock of crossing dimensions was strong, but with their powerful vitality, they should have woken up by now.

"Is there something in that river?"

"Hmm, no. Even if that river were filled with deadly poison, anyone with vitality above the Decisive Stage should be able to detoxify it. The reason your comrades aren't waking up is because of the ghostly energy of the Underworld."

"Hmm..."

Thinking about it, Yeonjin would have died coughing up blood if Yeonwi hadn't expelled the ghostly energy.

"If you don't learn the Ghost Dao Techniques, you'll be consumed by the energy of the Underworld and fall into a comatose state. The longer this state lasts, the higher the chance of death."

"No...! Then shouldn't we wake them up?"

"Yes. But since your comrades haven't learned the Ghost Dao Techniques, you'll have to forcefully teach them basic Ghost Dao Techniques from the outside."

"Hmm... If they don't possess ghostly energy, they'll fall into a comatose state..."

I looked down at Jeon Myunghoon.

"...Then why is this guy just sleeping?"

Following my gaze, Yeonwi looked at Jeon Myunghoon and started slapping his cheeks.

Slap, slap, slap!

"Ugh, argh!"

After a while, Jeon Myunghoon spat out blood and opened his eyes wide.

"Where... where am I...!"

"This guy was just sleeping."

"..."

"To wake the others, you need to infuse them with ghostly energy and implant basic Ghost Dao Techniques in their bodies."

"Yes, I will. But first..."

I explained the general situation to Jeon Myunghoon.

"...The Underworld..."

"Yes. And for now, we need to find the disciples of the Golden Thunder Sect in the Underworld and find a way back to the Guanghan Realm."

"...! What, the disciples of the Golden Thunder Sect...!"

Jeon Myunghoon was surprised to hear that the disciples of the Golden Thunder Sect were alive. He wiped his face.

"...They were alive."

"Yes, they were alive."

"...Thank goodness."

Jeon Myunghoon wiped his face and smiled faintly. After conveying the plan to Jeon Myunghoon, I approached the others to wake them up. Yeonwi used the Ghost Dao Techniques she knew to accumulate ghostly energy in Yeonjin's body, while I sat Oh Hyunseok and Kim Yeon up and infused them with ghostly energy.

Buzzâ€•

I considered infusing them with the basic Ghost Dao Techniques I had learned from Seorip. However, I felt that it wouldn't suit them.

"Hmm, then..."

After a moment of thought, I decided to create Ghost Dao Techniques on the spot. For Oh Hyunseok, I created a technique to train the body with ghostly energy, and for Kim Yeon, a technique to train the mind. I infused them with ghostly energy.

The ghostly energy flowed through their bodies as I intended. Soon, the ghostly energy became a perfect basic Ghost Dao Technique for both of them. It matched well with Oh Hyunseok's Changryeongseonggwangochadae Technique and Kim Yeon's Gimyoseongshimjeon Technique.

After a while, both of them opened their eyes as ghostly energy formed within them.

"Where is this..."

"Hmm, where are we, Eunhyun?"

I explained the current situation to them and the precautions in the Underworld, such as not reading the celestial signs.

Me, Yeonjin, Hongbeom, Kim Yeon, Jeon Myunghoon, and Oh Hyunseok. The six of us discussed our future plans and set our goals. Our primary goal in the Underworld was to return to the Guanghan Realm. Next, Jeon Myunghoon and I would search for the disciples of the Golden Thunder Sect.

"And since we're already in the Underworld, it would be good to build the Five Blessings Pillar."

Yeonwi crossed her arms and explained the true orthodox Pillar, the Five Blessings Pillar, to us.

"...As such, the Five Blessings Pillar is much stronger than the Five Elements Pillar. So, how about building the Pillar of Longevity, one of the Five Blessings Pillars, in the Underworld?"

At this point, I was at the Four Pillars Stage. Jeon Myunghoon was halfway to the Four Pillars Stage. Kim Yeon and Oh Hyunseok were at the Original Spirit Stage and Decisive Stage, respectively. Hongbeom would soon reach the Four Pillars Stage, so there was no need to worry about her. According to Yeonwi, only those at least at the Celestial Human Stage could perform the Pillar Ritual, so it would be difficult for Oh Hyunseok and Kim Yeon to build the Pillar in the Underworld.

"Hmm, do we really need to build the Five Blessings Pillar?"

Jeon Myunghoon asked Yeonwi, seemingly uninterested. Yeonwi responded as if it was obvious.

"Of course. The Five Blessings Pillar is overwhelmingly stronger than the Five Elements Pillar and is the true orthodox Pillar passed down from ancient times. Moreover, building the Five Blessings Pillar makes it easier to advance to the Unity Stage, and the stability of the domain formed at the Unity Stage is on a different level."

After hearing her words, Jeon Myunghoon seemed to ponder for a moment before his eyes lit up.

"But, Senior, didn't you say that building the Five Blessings Pillar is much slower than the Five Elements Pillar? And without understanding the Five Blessings, it's much harder to build, and the Pillar Ritual almost forces you to follow the principle of 'first understanding, then practice'?"

"Hmm, that's true."

"On the other hand, if you build the Five Elements Pillar using external methods, it can be done in less than a week, right?"

"Well... if you have the skills, it's not impossible. But are you planning to perform the Pillar Ritual with the Five Elements Pillar?"

Jeon Myunghoon nodded.

"If I can obtain the Five Blessings Pillar, I will. But if not, I plan to build the Five Elements Pillar and quickly advance."

"Hmm, why?"

Jeon Myunghoon took out a wooden box from his pocket and caressed it, his eyes shining.

"Because I need to become stronger quickly."

Crackle, crackle...

A faint red lightning flickered around him, pushing away the ghostly energy.

"I need to become stronger as soon as possible, to advance as quickly as possible... to quell this anger."

Crackle...!

"I heard it's easier to reach the Unity Stage? Even if I roughly build the Five Elements Pillar, I'm confident I can reach the Unity Stage. Stability of the domain? I can fill any instability with the power of the Celestial Tribulation..."

Jeon Myunghoon resolved himself, red lightning flickering in his eyes. Yeonwi, understanding but slightly troubled, spoke.

"Hmm, I understand your intention. But the fastest way to return to the Guanghan Realm is to open a 'shortcut' like the Black Ghost Bone Valley did. And... the easiest way to open a 'shortcut' is to build at least three of the Five Blessings Pillars and reach the late Four Pillars Stage."

I questioned her, puzzled.

"Can't we just ask the Black Ghost Bone Valley to return to the Guanghan Realm?"

"If you had come to the Underworld through the Black Ghost Bone Valley's shortcut, that would be possible. But you said you fell here by accident, not through the Black Ghost Bone Valley's shortcut, right? If you had come through the Black Ghost Bone Valley, you would have had the 'Dream Body' provided by the Subordinate Spirit..."

She clicked her tongue and continued.

"There are four major forces in the Underworld. They are called the Three Palaces and One Island. The first is the Black Ghost Bone Palace, the main sect of the Black Ghost Bone Valley. It's a secretive and closed group. The branch in the Guanghan Realm was a bit lenient to expand its influence, but the main sect is different. I've heard they have many hidden secrets and are extremely closed off. The second is the Nether Ghost Palace, the most extensive force. It's the most famous and powerful in the Underworld. They actively research Ghost Dao Techniques and Demonic Techniques, and their techniques influence the entire Underworld. Over 80% of the techniques circulated in the Underworld come from the Nether Ghost Palace. The third is the Flower Diagram Western Heaven Palace, a group of lunatics who practice orthodox techniques of righteousness in the ghostly Underworld. They gather the power of life and righteousness, which is highly effective against the creatures of the Underworld, making them a powerful group. I've heard rumors that they are related to the 'higher-ups,' so it's best to avoid them. And lastly, Penglai Island."

"Hmm?"

I was puzzled by the familiar name.

"Penglai Palace... the name is similar?"

"...I've heard that Penglai Island is also said to be taught by the same mountain god as Penglai Palace. Penglai Island in the Underworld knows about Penglai Palace in the Guanghan Realm, but they have no interest in each other. They share the same name and founder but don't care about each other. However, I've heard that Penglai Island here is famous for its Demonic Techniques rather than the Taesan Yeolje Technique. This Penglai Island is known for its Demonic Techniques..."

"Hmm..."

Hearing the name Penglai, I recalled the 'name' I had seen in the image of Hyeonwon. Cheonra (Heavenly Net). A being with the name of the net of heaven. I felt that the name 'Penglai,' which existed everywhere in the Middle Realm, was like a net.

"If Penglai is a net..."

What was this net created to catch? I pondered for a moment. At that moment...

"...?"

I tried to look up at the sky but remembered Yeonwi's advice and stopped.

"What's this? It feels like it's getting darker..."

It wasn't just me who felt the strangeness; Jeon Myunghoon, Kim Yeon, Oh Hyunseok, and Hongbeom also tilted their heads. Hongbeom asked me.

"Master, doesn't it feel like it's getting darker around us?"

"...Yes. I felt it too."

I extended my consciousness to see if there were any clouds, but there was nothing above us. Kim Yeon and Jeon Myunghoon also felt the oddness and tilted their heads.

"It feels like the whole world is getting darker..."

"Yeah. Is it just our imagination...?"

Yeonwi also tilted her head.

"Hmm... What phenomenon is this? Even the Water Realm seems a bit darker..."

* * *

Guanghan Realm. The summit of Cheonryeon Mountain. Above the white jade pavilion, Baek Unseongsa groaned with a trembling voice.

Rumbleâ€•

The entire Cheonryeon Mountain shook. At the same time, the spiritual energy of the entire mountain began to flow erratically. No, it wasn't just Cheonryeon Mountain. All the 'mountains' in the Guanghan Realm that Baek Unseongsa was aware of had their energy disrupted.

Baek Unseongsa looked up at the sky with trembling eyes and spoke.

"Has that tyrant finally been imprisoned? But the sky has darkened a bit. This means that even that person has suffered a fatal wound... How could this be... That tyrant was hiding such power? This is a sign similar to when that person was cornered by Guanghan 500,000 years ago..."

Baek Unseongsa bit his lip with a worried expression and adjusted the gravitational force of the entire Guanghan Realm, his eyes shining.

"If that person has suffered a fatal wound and gone into seclusion, the protective barrier of the Guanghan Realm, blessed by that person, will also weaken. I must be even more vigilant."

After finishing his words, Baek Unseongsa re-entered the white jade pavilion. The light emanating from the pavilion swept across the entire Guanghan Realm.

* * *

"...Just a celestial phenomenon."

Despite being on high alert, nothing happened, so I relaxed. Yeonwi also relaxed her expression.

"Well, if it's a celestial phenomenon on a cosmic scale, there's nothing we can do about it. Let's continue our conversation. Anyway, the Underworld is full of such forces. Each force is extremely wary of the others, and they always suspect outsiders of being spies from rival forces."

"In other words... in the Guanghan Realm, they think of each other as spies from the Demonic Clan?"

"Exactly!"

"..."

"So, forget about entering a rival force to use their shortcut. It's best if one of us builds the Five Blessings Pillar and opens the shortcut ourselves."

At those words, Jeon Myunghoon looked at me and spoke.

"Then it's best if you build the Pillar of Longevity or whatever."

"What...?"

"You have the most outstanding talent among us."

Yeonwi also nodded in agreement.

"That's right. Among us, you're the only one with the power of the Unity Stage. It took Hyeonwon thousands of years to reach the Unity Stage, but you did it in less than a hundred years. Moreover, I can sense the gravitational force from you... I don't know when you built it, but you also have the Pillar of Wealth. You should be able to build the Pillar quickly and open the shortcut."

With a hopeful expression, Yeonwi patted my shoulder.

"We have high hopes for you! You are our only hope, Seo Eunhyun!"

On the first day in the Underworld, I became the hope of everyone to return to the Guanghan Realm, receiving the expectant gazes of Yeonwi, Jeon Myunghoon, Oh Hyunseok, Kim Yeon, and Hongbeom.
