**Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 377: At Sea (5)**

Boom! Crackle!

Jin Liu's momentum was fierce. She chewed through the puppets charging at her and endured the beams and traps aimed at her with her bare body as she advanced.

Clank! Clank! Clank!

However, the more puppets she smashed, the more they reassembled on the spot, starting to bind her body. Gradually, Jin Liu's body was encased in puppet armor, but her steps did not falter.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The floor of the ship dented with each step. As Jin Liu approached, tension began to show on Kim Yeon's face. She looked at Jin Liu's blood-red, hammer-like grip and broke into a cold sweat.

'That hurts.'

It was Jin Liu who had captured Kim Yeon, knocking her out with a single blow from her pot-lid-sized hand. Kim Yeon shouted urgently to Buk Hyanghwa.

"We're almost there! When will it be done!?"

"Almost done! Stop rushing me!"

"Damn it! Don't you know how to hurry!? Move faster!"

Boom!

Finally, Jin Liu smashed Kim Yeon's last puppet and glared at her with a blood-red face. Something still felt lacking. Although Kim Yeon could face her alone, she had heard about the mating methods of the Two Ghost Clan and didn't dare to confront her recklessly.

"Hurry! Quickly!"

Kim Yeon, her face pale, reached behind her and grabbed Buk Hyanghwa's hair in a panic.

"Ahh! Let go! It's done!"

Buk Hyanghwa, irritated by the pain that felt like her scalp was being torn off, activated the device she had been modifying.

Flash!

"Krurrr?"

Jin Liu, who had been acting coquettishly, sensed something strange. Her senses felt off. Clank! Clank! Clank! Clank!

The corridor she was standing in suddenly flipped, and she saw Buk Hyanghwa and Kim Yeon moving to another location. No, the entire labyrinth-like corridor they had modified was splitting into segments and moving around.

'What is this...?'

The situation was so absurd that she snapped out of her aroused state and opened her eyes wide. Buk Hyanghwa, looking at the glowing device connected to her pattern, shouted.

"It's done! We're transmitting the modified parts to each section of the ship to quickly modify it in a simplified manner. From now on, you help, Sister!"

"Got it!"

Kim Yeon grabbed Buk Hyanghwa's hand and began to infuse her consciousness.

Whirrr!

Kim Yeon's consciousness spread throughout the entire ship. She quickly exchanged consciousness with Buk Hyanghwa through the peculiar heart device implanted in her head.

"I'll tell you the locations and methods for modification through consciousness, so follow along!"

"Okay, quickly!"

Buk Hyanghwa gave instructions to Kim Yeon, who then modified the entire ship in real-time through the transmitted modification spaces.

"Good, the ship itself is now partially puppetized!"

"Great, then send me the blueprint!"

"Here!"

Buk Hyanghwa, after briefly looking at the blueprint, grabbed Kim Yeon's hand with shining eyes.

"Can you connect that peculiar heart device more strongly to my mind?"

"Yes, I can, but..."

"Then do it quickly!"

Kim Yeon hesitated for a moment but then connected her consciousness more closely with Buk Hyanghwa's. Instantly, the space they were in became the command room.

Clank! Clank! Clank!

The command room and other modified parts of the ship were connected by the circuits of the puppet army through Kim Yeon's peculiar heart device. The ship was quickly transformed into a small-scale peculiar fortress.

Rumble!

Kim Yeon and Buk Hyanghwa extended their consciousness and looked up at the ceiling.

"We're heading out of the deep sea!"

"Let's go!"

Whoosh—

The ship raised its bow diagonally upward and began to move. Cutting through the deep sea of the high-power system, it advanced with its bow raised diagonally upward. Then, a resounding voice echoed throughout the ship.

Jin Mayeol's furious voice reverberated through the entire ship.

Rumble!

Jin Mayeol's domain moved, pressing down on Buk Hyanghwa and Kim Yeon. However, when Kim Yeon manipulated something, Jin Mayeol's pressure was instantly dispersed by the command room's device. Kim Yeon frowned as she read Jin Mayeol's anger, which had turned blood-red.

"He'll be here soon."

"Baek Lin Gong needs to wake up quickly..."

Buk Hyanghwa looked at Baek Lin, who was still unconscious. Although Baek Lin's energy had somewhat recovered, she had not yet regained her senses. Kim Yeon, also looking worriedly at Baek Lin, suddenly flinched and looked around.

"Jin Mayeol has withdrawn his domain! If he destroys everything and comes here... what do we do?"

But Buk Hyanghwa shook her head with a meaningful smile at Kim Yeon's concern.

"No, that won't happen."

"What?"

"As a fellow ship owner, I can tell. He won't recklessly destroy his own ship. He'll try to get through the labyrinths we've created to reach us."

"What? You blew up your own ship."

"It felt like sacrificing my own child. It was possible because there were other ships, but that Two Ghost Clan member only has this ship, so his affection for it is on a different level."

Buk Hyanghwa confidently steered the ship towards the surface.

"In other words, we still have time before Jin Mayeol finds us!"

Boom!

Then, the wall of the command room shattered, and Jin Mayeol, who had flown straight through the ship from the captain's cabin, met their eyes with a furious expression.

"...What, Hyanghwa. You were wrong."

"...Transmission."

Click!

Without a word, Buk Hyanghwa pressed a button, and she, Kim Yeon, Baek Lin, and Yuk Yo were all transmitted to another part of the ship.

Clank! Clank! Clank!

Buk Hyanghwa, avoiding Kim Yeon's gaze, silently modified the newly transmitted area into a command room again.

"...From now on, your name is Yingying. Got it?"

"..."

Buk Hyanghwa only puffed her cheeks at Kim Yeon's scolding.

* * *

Rumble!

How long had it been since they drilled through the dimensional sea into the domain of Taesan Yeolje Gong and Jeon Myeonghun? I finally arrived at the place where the signal of the peculiar heart device was connected. However, there was nothing there.

'Damn, what is this?'

The signal of the peculiar heart device was definitely connected around here.

"What is it, Seo Eunhyun? Didn't you say Kim Yeon was around here? Where is she?"

Jeon Myeonghun, expanding his domain to prevent the deep sea of the high-power system from invading, asked beside me. I closed my eyes and operated the peculiar heart device more finely. Due to the countless overlapping dimensional waves, the consciousness was not connecting well. Then, something caught my consciousness.

Buzz—

"...! There! Kim Yeon and the pirates are moving somewhere!"

"What? Where are they moving to?"

I looked diagonally upward.

"...It seems they're trying to go to the surface. Did they sense us?"

"Maybe. Alright, let's chase them."

"...No, instead of chasing, we'll go back to the surface and wait where they might come up. Once they reach a certain point, we'll use Taesan Yeolje Gong to evaporate the deep sea."

At my decision, the executives of the Mugeuk Cult nodded and prepared to ascend. Then, I suddenly saw a strange shadow inside the deep sea.

'Huh...?'

It was the shadow of a sea dragon. And on the sea dragon's nape, there were words written in the 'language of the underworld' that I had learned in the Black Bone Valley.

Blood Yin. Zeng Long. High Power. Below All Realms. Seed Dispersion. Xuan Yin's Plan. High Power Division Complete.

Reading the words, my eyes gleamed.

"...!"

I stared at the object for a moment, then reached out my hand.

Rumble!

It was fixed in one place in the deep sea, like the deep-sea map Yeonwi had mentioned. Upon closer inspection, it was a huge statue made of ancient stone. A statue carved in the shape of a sea dragon!

Rumble!

I compressed the space with my power and forcibly tore the statue fixed in the deep sea, then ascended with it in my arms.

'It needs to be investigated.'

Seo Hyul, who always took the form of a sea dragon. And Seo Hyul, who seemed to have some connection with the Blood Yin Realm. Seo Hyul, who always communicated with the Black Dragon King Xuan Yin as a member of the Sea Dragon Clan. There might be a clue to their connection.

* * *

"No, Yingying! You said he'd cherish his ship!"

"I didn't expect that despicable pirate to destroy his own ship to come after us!"

"What are we going to do! He'll be back soon!"

"You're the older sister! Do something!"

"Stop saying stupid things!"

Kim Yeon and Buk Hyanghwa argued while their hands moved busily. Meanwhile, Baek Lin, who was beside them, opened her eyes.

"Ugh... Conqueror King, Peculiar Ghost King. I'm sorry. Where is this...?"

Kim Yeon quickly conveyed the current situation to Baek Lin through the peculiar heart device. Baek Lin let out a low growl.

"So, Jin Mayeol is coming back here even though we still have a long way to go to the surface?"

"Yes! If we get caught, the ship will be restored, and we'll stay in the deep sea."

"Hmm..."

As they sighed with grim faces, Yuk Yo coughed and stood up. She wiped the blood from her mouth and took a deep breath.

"I'll be the bait."

Buk Hyanghwa and Kim Yeon were startled by her words. Baek Lin's eyes flared with blue ghost fire.

"What do you mean!? Do you want to die!?"

But Yuk Yo only gave a bitter smile, undeterred by Baek Lin's pressure.

"Jin Mayeol wants me. It was to save me that everyone else got captured, so I should take responsibility. I'll wander around the ship to distract him, so at least the others can escape to the surface."

"My Dragon Transformation Technique makes my skin and attack power weaker and especially slows me down when I transform into a dragon. That's why I was initially captured by the Mugeuk Cult. But following the Peculiar Ghost King's advice, I can now reverse this technique. It allows me to 'maintain my form while becoming faster and stronger.'"

Yuk Yo's eyes were resolute.

"I've lived my life running and deceiving. It's better for me to get caught than for you three. I can even deceive my way out, so don't worry."

Before anyone could stop her, Yuk Yo left the command room. Baek Lin, looking anxious, spoke to Buk Hyanghwa and Kim Yeon.

"I'm sorry, Your Highnesses. The leader ordered me to take care of Yuk Yo, so by the leader's command, I..."

Kim Yeon, after examining Baek Lin's thoughts, smiled and nodded.

"Go ahead, Baek Lin Gong. As you said, it's just a minor spirit. If you, a demon spirit, join, you can buy us time."

"Thank you, Peculiar Ghost King!"

Baek Lin quickly bowed to Kim Yeon and then shot out a beam of light, chasing after Yuk Yo. Kim Yeon watched her go, then resumed sensing the entire ship with her consciousness.

"...Indeed, Jin Mayeol is changing direction towards Yuk Yo and Baek Lin. We must reach the surface while they buy us time. Can you do it?"

"Yes... Ugh!"

Buk Hyanghwa, who had been infusing power into the device, frowned.

"What's wrong?"

"My power... is running out."

"Sigh, Yingying. That's why I told you to reach the Celestial Realm quickly."

"Do you think it's that easy!?"

"What's so hard about it?"

Kim Yeon chuckled and began to infuse her power into Buk Hyanghwa's back.

Whirrr!

Connected through the peculiar heart device, Buk Hyanghwa blushed as Kim Yeon's power flowed into her.

'Wait, this person...'

For a moment, Buk Hyanghwa saw a pinkish glow. Receiving both Kim Yeon's consciousness and power, she also felt some of Kim Yeon's emotions. Affection, admiration, curiosity, joy, desire... It was an indescribable feeling. But if she had to name it, it was a warm emotion. Buk Hyanghwa felt as if she was in the embrace of her mother, Yeon, beyond the pinkish glow.

Whirrr!

The pattern on Buk Hyanghwa's face glowed brightly.

"...Step aside, Sister."

"Huh?"

Buk Hyanghwa took a deep breath and extended her hands. Simultaneously, the spider-leg puppet on her back began to move.

Clank, clank...

Clank! Clank! Clank! Clank!

"What, what is this?"

Kim Yeon looked at Buk Hyanghwa with a slightly surprised face. Her hands were moving faster than before. Feeling as if she was possessed, Kim Yeon looked at Buk Hyanghwa with a curious gaze.

"From now on, we'll overdrive the device we created. We didn't make it for permanent use anyway. We'll reach the surface quickly. Once we reach the surface, contact the leader with your consciousness. If the leader sends Kim Younghoon Gong, the situation will be resolved quickly."

"Yingying, you..."

"And!"

Buk Hyanghwa shouted at Kim Yeon.

"My name is Buk Hyanghwa. Not Buk Yingying!"

Kim Yeon smiled softly and patted Buk Hyanghwa's head.

"...Alright, Hyanghwa."

"Don't get too close! Your face is already big enough to be intimidating!"

Buk Hyanghwa blushed as Kim Yeon's face approached, and Kim Yeon gave her a playful flick on the forehead before they both started controlling the ship. However, they no longer argued as they had before.
