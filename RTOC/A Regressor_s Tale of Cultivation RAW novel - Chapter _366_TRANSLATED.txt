Holding Hands (2)

At Yukrin's words, several members of the Wujigyo Sect trembled. Among them, Baekrin was especially furious, shaking so much that his jaw quivered. It seemed as if he would immediately shout, "How dare you speak such nonsense!" If the opponent hadn't been a Haptigi, he probably would have done so. I chuckled briefly, pondering how to politely decline this proposal.

"...I'm sorry, but this sect leader has no intention of taking concubines at the moment."

"Oh, is that so? What a pity."

Fortunately, Yukrin didn't press further, perhaps feeling a pang of conscience. Instead, he smiled kindly and explained his reason.

"The truth is, the reason I invited you and your sect here was to propose an alliance. Among alliances, there are few as strong as a blood alliance, so I thought of a marriage alliance, but that's a bit disappointing."

"An alliance, you say. Why do you wish to ally with us?"

"Isn't it obvious? Although you are the ruler of a sea region, the fame of your conquest fleet has been heard for nearly 200 years. And the organization that the conquest fleet joined as mercenaries is your sect. It's a natural instinct for many beings to want to join the strong."

"Haha, that's flattering. But I fear that our sect might only bring trouble to the Zhenglong Palace."

When I tactfully declined, Yukrin laughed heartily again.

"It seems the sect leader finds it burdensome to join forces with me. To be honest, there's no real benefit for your sect in forming a relationship with my palace. How about this then?"

Ting!

As he snapped his fingers, a force enveloped the area, isolating the entire Zhenglong Island from the outside. While it could be seen as a measure to avoid surveillance, it could also be a prelude to an attack, causing everyone to tense up and sharpen their gazes. However, Yukrin did not attack us. He merely cast a few more spells, creating a barrier that covered the entire Zhenglong Palace and another that blocked our current location. After using several layers of magic to cut off external views, he spoke in a secretive voice.

"I originally intended to propose this after forming an alliance, but I'll offer it to you first."

"A proposal?"

"Yes, you've been in the Goryeok Realm for a few days now, so you must have some understanding of this place."

"Indeed. A world covered like a sea of ruins... it's quite fascinating."

"Haha, it must seem that way to those from other realms. But the important thing is this: if you enter the deep sea, the chances of obtaining relics from the ruined world are high."

Indeed. The Goryeok Realm was a world of endless possibilities, except for the risk of getting lost in the deep sea or encountering deep-sea monsters. The Goryeok Realm was literally a collection of ruined worlds, and as he said, there was a high possibility of obtaining countless treasures from the remnants of those ruined worlds.

"Of course, it's just a possibility. Among the many dimensional traces, finding a proper relic is only possible in the very deep sea dimensions, and even then, it's not easy to re-enter a dimension once you've been there. This is because, like the sea of another world filled with water, the deep sea of the Goryeok Realm also flows endlessly like water. So even if you accidentally enter a dimension with many treasures, whether you can enter that dimension again is purely a matter of luck."

"I've heard as much."

"That's why, even if you accidentally enter a dimension with many treasures, it's common to come back with only trivial relics. But... the Deep Sea Island is different."

At his words, Bukhyanghwa and Kim Younghoon, along with other members of the Bukhyang Fleet, showed great surprise. Bukhyanghwa asked in astonishment.

"Are you saying that the Zhenglong Palace Lord knows the location of the Deep Sea Island?"

"Yes. It seems the Conquest King, despite ruling several sea regions, has never heard of the location of the Deep Sea Island."

Curious, I asked.

"What is this Deep Sea Island?"

Yeonwi explained to me.

"Sect Leader, as the name suggests, the Deep Sea Island is an island located in the deep sea. Generally, the islands in the Goryeok Realm are fixed in place, floating on the surface of the deep sea, but the Deep Sea Island is fixed 'inside the deep sea.'"

"Ho, that's remarkable. So, what the Palace Lord is saying is...."

"Yes. I know the location of the Deep Sea Island. In fact, among the countless palace lords in the Goryeok Realm, only a few know the location of the Deep Sea Island. Once discovered, the Deep Sea Island can be explored calmly, continuously challenging to obtain endless treasures, or it can be completely occupied and turned into a private territory, making it the safest treasure vault."

Yukrin spoke with a subtle expression.

"To be honest, as the ruler of the Weizheng Sea Region, I can roughly know what happens throughout the Weizheng Sea Region. I watched your battle from afar."

"Oh?"

"The power you used is crucial for attacking the Deep Sea Island I discovered. The barrier surrounding the Deep Sea Island can only be easily passed through with your power."

In other words, he needed my help to pass through the barrier of the Deep Sea Island.

'This is similar to Seran's proposal.'

Seran had also sought my help to pass through the barrier of the Seomyeongham.

'And Seran had planned to betray me but changed her mind.'

I glanced at Seran, who looked puzzled when our eyes met. I then turned my gaze back to Yukrin.

"Even if there are many treasures on the Deep Sea Island, there's no guarantee that they will be useful to our sect."

"Last time on the Deep Sea Island, I saw numerous bookshelves filled with elixirs written in the language of the ghostly creatures."

Wooong!

When Yukrin took out a small crystal from his sleeve and tapped it, a holographic image emerged from the crystal. My eyes widened in surprise.

In a dark library, one of the bookshelves was filled with books titled 'Budeokje Saseo,' 'Sumyeongje Saseo,' and 'Yuhodeokje Saseo' in the language of the underworld. Each shelf was filled with numerous copies of one type of book, and one shelf was empty.

"That empty shelf is presumed to have contained the 'Gangnyeongje Saseo.' Since you seem to have already accumulated the Five Blessings, I'll tell you that if you don't use the corresponding axis in the Middle Realm, it will be reabsorbed by the corresponding realm. It probably melted into the Goryeok Realm."

"..."

"The Zhenglong Palace has no need for such axes. I, for one, am a Haptigi who no longer needs axes, and to rule the Weizheng Sea Region, the more people who have accumulated such axes, the more my position is threatened. But for your sect, where the relationship between the sect leader and the subordinates doesn't seem so vertical, it's an opportunity to arm your forces with the Five Blessings at once."

He spoke with a subtle expression.

"Moreover, as the sect leader who has accumulated the Five Blessings, you know that the axis of Yuhodeok is the hardest to obtain, right? Haha... If you help me, I am willing to give you the entire library. Of course, I don't know what other treasures are inside, but I will acknowledge that any treasure you obtain is yours. I only need two items from the inside."

"..."

I looked at the hologram of the library in front of me.

'It's real.'

Yukrin was not lying about the Deep Sea Island, the need for my help to enter it, or the numerous books containing the Five Blessings inside the library. It was all true.

Therefore, it was right to accept it immediately. With Yeonwi's explanation, not only I and the Wujigyo Sect's executives but also the Bukhyang Fleet's executives knew about the Five Blessings and the treasures containing such axes, so everyone was holding their breath.

However, I exchanged glances with Kim Younghoon.

Suspicious.

But Yukrin, aware of my concern about betrayal, immediately presented something black in front of us. It was a contract.

I read the contract he handed over. The paper contained the terms of the alliance between the Wujigyo Sect and the Zhenglong Palace, written in the language of the Yozu.

'This contract is not ordinary.'

I examined the material of the contract, made of some unknown leather, and my eyes sparkled. Bukhyanghwa, who seemed to know something, was startled when she saw the contract.

"Does the Conquest King know about this?"

I turned to her and asked, and Yukrin laughed heartily.

"Haha, let me explain. This is a contract made of Hyongoji, a rare material occasionally found in the deep sea of the Goryeok Realm. To be precise, it's not a genuine Hyongoji but an imitation. However, even an imitation has the same function as the real one. A contract written on Hyongoji can be mediated by a higher being, and as long as that being is alive, the contract remains in effect."

"A higher mediator, you say...?"

"The being registered on this Hyongoji is the Holy Priest Haerin of the Goryeok Realm. The Holy Priest guarantees our alliance."

"Ho..."

I carefully examined the alliance contract. Unlike the swindler Yukyo, the Hyongoji presented by Yukrin had no particularly disadvantageous clauses for us. The contract itself was quite lenient. It mainly prohibited unilateral betrayal and required mutual protection in times of crisis. There were no additional clauses in small print, nor were there any other papers attached to the contract.

There was really nothing suspicious about it. If there was anything suspicious, it was just one thing.

'This guy...'

The Zhenglong Palace Lord Yukrin. It was him alone.

'His head is filled with nothing but thoughts of betraying me.'

I hadn't realized it during the video call with the magic tool, but seeing him in person, I could tell. He was determined to deceive me.

I glanced at the jade-colored prayer beads on Yukrin's arm.

'A magic tool that blocks the eyes of the Simjok.'

I had seen something similar from Seohyeol before. It seemed he had prepared it to block the eyes of the pirate captain of the Tugui Tribe, but it was insufficient to block my and Kim Younghoon's eyes, so I could read everything.

Kim Younghoon, who had read Yukrin's intentions, asked me in sign language.

―Should we blow his head off?

Twitch.

Yukrin didn't notice our sign language, but he seemed a bit tense, as if the celestial energy was warning him of something suspicious. I laughed heartily and showed the contract to all my comrades.

"Our sect makes major decisions by consulting with the protectors and executives, so please understand."

"Of course."

While I controlled my outward expression and celestial energy to appear relaxed, I remained wary of Yukrin, who was filled with thoughts of betraying me. I asked Bukhyanghwa, who seemed knowledgeable about Hyongoji.

"Do you know the difference between genuine Hyongoji and imitation Hyongoji?"

"The main difference is that the imitation can only use beings up to the level of a True Person as mediators, while the genuine can use even True Immortals as mediators. The genuine is extremely valuable, and I heard that only the Holy Priest possesses one in the Goryeok Realm."

"Ho..."

She examined the Hyongoji and explained. 'It seems there's no trick in the contract itself.'

I showed the contract to Kim Younghoon, Jeon Myunghoon, Hongbeom, and Yeonwi, and they all nodded, acknowledging that there was nothing wrong with the contract itself. The contract mainly contained clauses prohibiting betrayal and mutual protection, so there was no way to be deceived by the contract alone.

But I had to think carefully. Even if the contract was fine, if the person making the contract was a swindler, it would still be a fraudulent contract.

"...Is there any record of the entire Deep Sea Island?"

"Here it is. This is all the records and exploration logs I made while exploring the Deep Sea Island."

Yukrin readily handed me a crystal orb. When he tapped the crystal orb, numerous holograms containing information about the Deep Sea Island floated in the air. The air was filled with countless scenes, seemingly memories of Yukrin's exploration of the Deep Sea Island.

And then, I, Bukhyanghwa, Seran, Songjin, and Kim Younghoon all focused on one particular hologram.

Flinch!

I widened my eyes and stared at the hologram.

"...Does this Deep Sea Island have a name?"

He smiled and said.

"If you read my exploration log, you'll know, but the Deep Sea Island I discovered was called 'Bongraedo' in ancient times."

In front of me was the Deep Sea Island named 'Bongraedo.' Bongraedo was covered by a translucent white spherical barrier, and at its center was a massive mountain occupying half of Bongraedo's area. That mountain was a white salt mountain.

Yukrin smiled and seemed about to explain something when a communication talisman flew urgently in front of him. He received the message, and his face twisted in anger. He stood up, barely suppressing his rage.

"...It's embarrassing to say, but it seems my daughter, whom your sect escorted, has run away again."

"..."

"She probably hasn't gone far, so I need to catch her quickly. Haha, I'm really sorry, but please wait for a moment."

Gritting his teeth, Yukrin left the room, and I spoke to Baekrin.

"13th Guardian King, Princess Seongran Yukyo was originally your responsibility to escort. As a guest, it's not right for the host to handle it personally. Escort the Zhenglong Palace Lord and bring back Princess Seongran."

"Yes, Sect Leader!"

"Haha... There's no need to help, but..."

"Please accept it as a gesture of goodwill from our sect."

"...Thank you very much."

Yukrin gritted his teeth in shame and left, followed by Baekrin.

'At least with Baekrin following, he won't kill his daughter.'

I had felt it from the beginning, but Yukrin didn't seem to have any familial affection for Yukyo. Given the anger emanating from him, he might really kill her. Although she was a swindler and a troublemaker, she had provided me with basic knowledge about the Goryeok Realm, so I couldn't let her be killed by her father.

After Yukrin's presence disappeared from Zhenglong Island, I snapped my fingers and took control of the formation Yukrin had set up.

Tststst!

The circuit of the Mysterious Heart Transmission Technique spread over the barrier, temporarily creating a space that even Yukrin couldn't monitor.

"Now, everyone, please share your opinions."

Given the situation, it was a good time to hold a quick meeting. Bukhyanghwa spoke first.

"There is nothing suspicious about the contract itself."

However, Kim Younghoon frowned and shook his head.

"You saw it too. The Zhenglong Palace Lord's head is filled with nothing but thoughts of betraying us. Although the reward he offered is real..."

At his words, the Guardian Kings present showed expressions of anger.

"How dare he...! To deceive the Sect Leader...!"

"Like father, like son!"

"Sect Leader! We should destroy Zhenglong Island and turn the Zhenglong Palace Lord into fish soup!"

For a while, the Guardian Kings vented their anger, and Hongbeom quietly spoke.

"Silence."

At Hongbeom's words, the Guardian Kings fell silent, and he calmly looked at Seran.

"Do you have anything to say, Lady Seran?"

Seran nodded and spoke.

"First of all, Senior. As you saw, that was a salt mountain. And the energy wave seen in the Zhenglong Palace Lord's memory. That wave was the same as that of the Great Sage Cheongmunryeong."

Since Yukrin was a member of the Simjok, his memory-based hologram included the flow of celestial energy. Indeed, that salt mountain was the same as Cheongmunryeong's. In other words...

'It's a relic left by the owner of the salt mountain.'

At Seran's words, Kim Younghoon nodded.

"...It did seem related to Cheongmunryeong. It would certainly help in rescuing him."

Hongbeom nodded and spoke.

"Looking at those numerous axes, I also thought that bringing them to our sect would provide tremendous power."

"Indeed..."

Moreover, there was the Yuhodeokje Saseo. The axis of Yuhodeok was harder to obtain than other axes. Even Yeonwi hadn't obtained the axis of Yuhodeok. Yeonwi then spoke.

"The situation is like this. Yukrin is highly likely to betray us. But the reward is too tempting to ignore, right?"

"That's right."

"Then there's a very simple solution."

"What is it?"

I looked at Yeonwi with a puzzled expression, and she smiled and explained.

"It's a very fundamental strategy passed down from the time of the ancestors. The ancestors said that with this method, you could always hear the true intentions of anyone."

I showed a slightly ominous look at the mention of 'from the time of the ancestors,' but she continued without concern.

"Right now, capture that suspicious fish, and use torture techniques like the Agonizing Thunder Curse Banner to torture him. Ah, since you're skilled in curses, you can use more diverse tortures. After capturing him, keep inflicting pain until he reveals all his hidden cards and becomes very cooperative."

"..."

"What are you waiting for! Guardian Kings, prepare to conquer the Zhenglong Palace! Since he invited us, let's destroy the barrier from the inside, capture his castle, and set a trap. When he returns, we'll capture and torture him!"
