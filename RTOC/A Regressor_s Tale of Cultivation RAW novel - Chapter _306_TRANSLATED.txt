The black claws tore through the air. I quickly rolled backward, dodging Kang Minhee's attack. In an instant, her attack sliced through the air where I had been, cutting through the terrain of Hanumtaek. A chilling blue aura rose visibly from the spot her attack had grazed.

"Damn it." If I got hit, I would die. I could feel it clearly. Even if I used the Circuit of the Formless Sword and the Monster Army with this body, it would only be at the level of a Celestial. There was no way I could stop her, a Four Fiend.

"Did she realize I'm Seo Eunhyun?" It didn't seem like it. I glanced at her, examining her intent. "The dark red intent of hatred... is deeply settled."

If she knew I was here in person, her anger would have flared up rather than this cold hatred. So, there was only one possibility. "Did she mistake me for someone else?" That was the only explanation. I quickly retreated and shouted at Kang Minhee.

"Elder, why are you doing this? Could it be a misunderstanding?"

Kang Minhee scoffed. "There's no way it's a misunderstanding. That darkness... this sense of déjà vu... and those familiar actions... You are that guy."

"What do you mean by 'that guy'?"

"Well, did you ever have a name? I don't know. I've always called you Shadow. Sometimes you mimicked a mother, sometimes a father, sometimes a friend, and sometimes a complete stranger. That's your identity, isn't it? This time, you're mimicking someone I don't know."

"Damn it." There was no doubt. She mistook me for someone else, not Seo Eunhyun. That someone seemed to be a being shrouded in darkness, like the deathly aura I exuded.

"Even though she seems smart, Kang Minhee sometimes trusts her intelligence too much and jumps to strange conclusions." About a year and a half before coming to Deungsunhyang, we had fought because of a project she pushed, which caused significant losses to the company.

"Well, thanks to that, I memorized the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, so it wasn't a total loss..." Anyway, she sometimes made mistakes by trusting her genius too much. This seemed to be one of those times.

"Judging by her state, she won't listen even if I explain." 

Boom! Her attack flew past me, exploding in a blue light beyond the horizon of Hanumtaek, dyeing the sky. The chilling aura froze my entire body. My movements began to slow down. Kang Minhee approached for close combat, swinging her attack, and in an instant, extended it to pierce my right arm. At the same time, she shortened the attack and grabbed my collar with her right arm, pulling me towards her.

"This is... a leg sweep!" She seemed to grasp the flow of power, and I began to fall, overpowered by Kang Minhee. She was good at everything. Work, exercise, foreign languages. She was a jack-of-all-trades, except for interpersonal relationships and morality.

One famous story about Kang Minhee was when she visited Oh Hyeso's apartment, where Jeon Myunghoon was having a small party with female employees. Jeon Myunghoon tried to harass Kang Minhee, and she immediately threw him down. Jeon Myunghoon ended up with a broken ankle and six weeks of recovery. He couldn't even look at Kang Minhee for a while, walking around with crutches.

"Didn't Oh Hyeso tell me about this?" According to Oh Hyeso, after breaking Jeon Myunghoon's ankle, Kang Minhee calmly smoked a cigarette and sent him to the hospital in a taxi. Jeon Myunghoon claimed he was on crutches due to a car accident, but everyone in the department knew the truth thanks to Oh Hyeso. Kim Younghoon and Oh Hyunseok considered reporting it, but since neither side said much, the incident was quietly resolved.

"Indeed, she's strong." Kang Minhee was strong. Even before coming to Deungsunhyang, she had the skills of a top martial artist, even though she couldn't use internal energy. I twisted my body in mid-air, planting my feet on the ground, and pushed off, clashing my palms against Kang Minhee. As the Blood Demon Sea activated, a vast sea of blood appeared between us, and I used it to distance myself from her. And then, I realized something.

"Kang Minhee..." 

A line of intent aimed at my neck. I quickly dodged the following attack, breaking into a cold sweat. She had reached the peak realm on her own, using the judo and combat experience she learned on Earth, along with her attack. Unlike Kim Yeon, who reached the Moon Crossing Heaven with my help, or Oh Hyunseok, who was born with a unique body and trained under Changhoja, or Kim Younghoon, who had a talent for martial arts, she reached the peak realm purely through her own effort and talent.

"Indeed, a genius."

* * *

"Damn it." I clicked my tongue inwardly, focusing my consciousness on Seorip. Something significant was happening there, and shocking truths were being revealed in front of me.

"Were you engaged to Hyeonwon?"

"Yes. We got engaged for benefits rather than affection. Of course, Hyeonwon has mellowed now, but he was quite handsome when he was young, so I didn't mind. He seemed to like me too."

Yeonwi continued her story. "At first, it was more friendship than love. No, we felt camaraderie while capturing the Black Dragon King. We worked well together... If our relationship had continued, it might have developed into love. Until Hyeonwon fell in love with another woman."

A bitter expression crossed her face. "Hyeonwon fell in love with another woman from the Golden Thunder Sect and apologized to me. I was a bit disappointed but accepted it. After all, it would benefit the Golden Thunder Sect. I was willing to break the engagement if it was a love marriage rather than a political one. And... I wanted to see the bold disciple who stole his heart."

In front of me, the shocking past of Hyeonwon and Yeonwi was unfolding. On the other side, Kang Minhee and Seorip were engaged in a relentless chase. I quickly turned my mind, trying to figure out who Kang Minhee mistook Seorip for. My mind was unusually sharp, and I felt like I could see the relationships between people unfolding before me. How to twist those relationships to my advantage. Countless thoughts and plans poured out.

"What a strange feeling." I wondered if I always had this talent. I examined the relationships, tracing back the 'Shadow' that Kang Minhee mentioned while attacking Seorip. And then, I felt something strange.

"The person she calls Shadow is something that has been with Kang Minhee since Earth." That meant it was one of the Fated Ones. But the characteristics she mentioned matched 'Seo Eunhyun.' However, Seo Eunhyun was different from 'Shadow.'

"What is this? Who is Shadow?" I instructed Seorip to ask Kang Minhee a few questions. Following my orders, Seorip threw the lines I had written at Kang Minhee.

* * *

"Hehe, Kang Sa-woo. Why are you doing this? Was it because you didn't like the prank I played after joining the company?"

Kang Minhee, now in the form of an Eight-foot Ghost, attacked me even more ferociously.

* * *

"Judging by Kang Minhee's reaction, it's someone who influenced her before joining the company. She lost her father, so her mother? No. Her mother, whom I met once, wouldn't say such things. Then..." I quickly turned my mind and reached a conclusion.

"Kang Minhee has a mental illness I didn't know about. She has been seeing hallucinations due to this illness, and she is trying to explain her misfortune through these hallucinations. She is now mistaking Seorip's characteristics for her hallucination."

I had always thought I needed treatment. In hindsight, it seemed like an overreaction, but there must have been a reason for my judgment. But now, it seemed that the one who needed treatment was Kang Minhee, not me. And then, Yeonwi's next words startled me.

"The name of the disciple Hyeonwon loved was Cheonra. There is no female disciple named Cheonra in our Golden Thunder Sect. Even after searching for male disciples who learned the gender transformation technique, there was none. I even contacted the main sect in the underworld, but there was no one named Cheonra. Hyeonwon... at some point, he developed a mental illness, creating and loving a non-existent woman."

"...!?" The revealed truth left me speechless. "He loved the Golden Thunder Sect because of a mental illness, and he tried to kill me and Jeon Myunghoon, claiming we couldn't protect the Golden Thunder Sect?"

I felt a surge of irritation towards Hyeonwon, but then I sensed something strange. The investigation of the combined technique was not just about strength. Expanding the realm of consciousness meant perceiving and understanding more, and growing mentally. At the level of the combined technique, going mad was not easy. The mind itself became too strong.

So, what caused Hyeonwon to develop a mental illness? "Why did he develop a mental illness?"

Yeonwi looked up at the sky for a while. Her intent carried a hint of bitterness, regret, and fear. "I investigated why. The process of finding out was arduous, but... to cut to the chase, I found out in the underworld why Hyeonwon developed a mental illness."

"A non-existent woman he created and loved." I felt that Kang Minhee, who was fighting Seorip, overlapped with Hyeonwon. She, too, was creating and hating something non-existent.

"Maybe there's a clue to solving Kang Minhee's problem?" I focused on Yeonwi's words. "Why did he develop it?"

"...A god."

"A god...?"

"Hyeonwon developed a severe mental fracture by directly witnessing a great high-ranking being, called a god. Such a vast difference in existence can cause mental problems even if it appears in a dream."

A great being. A True Immortal. Perhaps Kang Minhee's mental illness was also related to a True Immortal. "And... whether it was due to the influence of that high-ranking being, the Guanghan Realm tried to erase traces of the Golden Thunder Sect and some others at some point. Under Baekun's orders, I erased the Golden Thunder Sect with my own hands. I used the sacred artifact of the Yin Soul Ghost Sect and the secret arts I learned in the underworld to forcibly seal Hyeonwon's mind and treat him."

Yeonwi revealed the truth from 40,000 years ago. "After treating Hyeonwon's mind, he firmly believed I killed his lover. His memory was distorted during the treatment. The rest is known. I sacrificed the sacred artifact of the Yin Soul Ghost Sect to weaken Hyeonwon's realm and inflicted a fatal wound, making him recuperate in Geongon Castle."

This was the truth from 40,000 years ago. Yeonwi, under the orders of Baekun, the Holy Sage of the Guanghan Realm, destroyed the Golden Thunder Sect with her own hands and tried to treat Hyeonwon in the process. The treatment succeeded, but at the cost of distorting Hyeonwon's memory, making him believe Yeonwi killed his lover. I thought about the bitter intent flowing from Yeonwi inside Yeonjin.

"What a tragic fate." And then, I felt something strange. "Is Hyeonwon's fate tragic, or is Yeonwi's fate tragic?" For some reason, I felt that Hyeonwon, whose mind was toyed with by a great being, had a more tragic fate.

* * *

"Damn it, main body. Kang Minhee is going even crazier!" After I mentioned Kang Sa-woo, Kang Minhee completely lost it and charged at me.

"Is Hyeonwon's fate tragic? I feel that Yeonwi, who was betrayed by her lover, has a more tragic fate..." It was a strange difference of opinion between my main body and me.

Whoosh! Slash! Kang Minhee's attack tore a chunk out of my stomach. "This won't do."

At this rate, I would die. Dying wasn't the problem, but losing the identity I had established in the Black Ghost Valley would be painful. "I promised to go to the Jeomuldo with Seorip's identity, along with Jeongryongjin. I can't waste this opportunity...!"

Absolutely not. I quickly thought. Won-yu's blood body had learned the Celestial Clan's techniques. It could use the Formless Sword and other techniques, and even the Monster Army's circuit. But it hadn't learned the Earth Clan's techniques.

"The Celestial and Earth Demons don't harmonize, so I can't overcome the two-realm difference." In that case, how could I win against Kang Minhee, who wouldn't listen to any explanation? How...

As I pondered, I suddenly observed the demonized Won-young within me. "Wait, is that possible?" It seemed like a crazy idea, but I felt it might be possible with Seorip's body. If I couldn't overcome the two-realm difference, I could reduce it to a one-realm difference. In other words...

"While escaping from Kang Minhee, I'll immediately elevate this body to the Celestial Realm!" 

Whoosh! Absorbing the surrounding yin energy and the demonic energy from Kang Minhee, I quickly began to focus my mind on the Celestial Realm incantation. "Ascend to the Celestial Realm!" Right now, immediately!
