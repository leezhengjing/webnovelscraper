### Friends from Afar (4)

Based on the structure of the Seomyeong-class ships, the mass-produced Seomyeong-class, commonly known as 'Bukhyang-class,' is divided into four grades.

First is the command ship, Ilhyang-class, which the captain boards. To date, three Ilhyang-class ships have been built, each with a length of 400 zhang and a width of 70 zhang. These ships are directly connected to the power source of the Bukhyang fleet and supply power to the Ihyang-class ships under their command. The combat power of an Ilhyang-class ship ranges from a maximum of the peak of the Celestial Human stage to a minimum of the early Celestial Human stage.

Second is the Ihyang-class, used for full-scale fleet battles. To date, 31 Ihyang-class ships have been built, each with a length of 100 zhang and a width of 10 zhang. These ships receive power from the Ilhyang-class and supply it to the Samhyang-class ships under their command. The combat power of an Ihyang-class ship ranges from a maximum of the early Celestial Human stage to a minimum of the mid-Origin stage.

Third is the Samhyang-class, designed to assist the Ihyang-class in fleet battles and command the Sahyang-class. To date, 322 Samhyang-class ships have been built, each with a length of 60 zhang and a width of 7 zhang. These ships process the power received from the Ilhyang and Ihyang-class ships and deliver it to the Sahyang-class. The combat power of a Samhyang-class ship ranges from a maximum of the peak of the Origin stage to a minimum of the early Origin stage.

Lastly, the flower of the Bukhyang fleet, the Sahyang-class, which earned the fleet the nickname 'Invincible Fleet' in the high-power realm. To date, 6,027 Sahyang-class ships have been built, each with a length of 10 zhang and a width of 15 chi. The Sahyang-class has no combat power standard because they are not designed for battle. However, the Bukhyang fleet is considered the strongest fleet thanks to the Sahyang-class. The Ihyang and Samhyang-class ships exist solely to protect and control the Sahyang-class. The Bukhyang fleet is not focused on combat power, and even when all 6,383 ships are combined, their power is only equivalent to the late Sacrifice stage. Currently, with only about one-third of the fleet present, their power is equivalent to the early to mid-Sacrifice stage.

Despite this, the fleet commander standing at the bow of the Ilhyang-class ship, a woman in white, looked relaxed.

"First Fleet, divide into five squadrons of 200 ships each and secure the east, west, south, north, and airspace of the target point. Prepare to create a sea circle. Second Fleet, escort the Ilhyang-class ship and slowly move to the target point. One shichen before reaching the target point, detach the 7th, 8th, and 9th squadrons of the Second Fleet to prepare for the sea chaos. Only the 6th and 10th squadrons will remain to prepare for direct combat."

She quickly input commands into a translucent scroll floating in the air, manipulating the Bukhyang fleet. Following her orders, the 2,000 ships moved in perfect unison. After inputting commands for a while and issuing orders to the few crew members of the Bukhyang fleet, she suddenly looked at the target point of the fleet, where the demonic creatures of the otherworld had appeared.

'Why do I feel this way?'

She frowned. Although she had barely reached the Origin stage by consuming numerous elixirs in the high-power realm, she had lost her ability to read celestial energy and foresee or sense things due to her celestial cultivation. However, her intuition told her that something significant would happen if they encountered the demonic creatures.

Thump, thump...

Was it tension or fear? She felt an unfamiliar sensation as she stared at the sea area where demonic energy was beginning to fill.

* * *

I was contemplating how to deal with Yukyo.

'This has become quite troublesome.'

If I had known it would turn out like this, I would have interrogated Yukyo first. If I had known her identity and background, I would have thrown her to the Dragon Palace's aquatic tribe without any treatment. But who could have predicted this turn of events?

As I glared at Yukyo with a displeased expression, she, despite being a carp, broke into a cold sweat and tried to change the atmosphere.

"Haha, by the way, senior. I apologize, but could you let me go if I offer you the Dragon Transformation Technique?"

"......"

"If my father catches me this time, he will definitely marry me off to that brutal pirate captain! I can't let that happen! He will surely make me into carp stew!"

"......"

She went on a long rant about the cruelty and brutality of the pirate captain Jin Mayeol, but I just clicked my tongue.

'It's obvious she's exaggerating.'

Her extreme exaggeration made it clear she was lying. She cautiously asked me.

"Senior, aren't you curious about the Dragon Transformation Technique? It's a famous divine technique derived from celestial arts..."

"Celestial arts, huh..."

I became slightly interested.

"Show me the incantation."

At my words, Yukyo quickly took out a jade slip and seemed to copy the incantation before handing it to me. As I read the jade slip, I frowned.

"What is this? It's only the latter half of the incantation."

"Hehe, if you help me escape, I'll give you the first half too. I really don't want to be caught by my father again..."

'She just doesn't want to marry the pirate captain.'

I observed Yukyo and realized something. She was afraid of something about her father, Yukrin.

'Is there something she's not telling me?'

However, I was too lazy to ask more about what this troublesome carp had done.

"The first half of the Dragon Transformation Technique involves obtaining the dragon's energy and cultivating it to mimic the dragon's form. The latter half explains how to maintain the mimicked form and the drawbacks of the technique."

"Hmm..."

I read the latter half in detail. The drawbacks of the Dragon Transformation Technique were as follows: Once transformed into a dragon, one's combat power, speed, stamina, and durability decrease. It also takes some time to revert back to the original form. If one stays transformed for too long, they might be mentally affected by the dragon's personality.

As I read the latter half of the incantation, I felt something strange.

"...Did you know what kind of technique this is when you used it?"

"Yes? Isn't it a divine technique that allows one to change their race?"

"That's true, but do you understand how the process works?"

"Ah... I haven't fully understood the process yet..."

I stroked one of my 19 chins and lit up my eyes.

"This is a type of curse."

"Excuse me?"

"It's a curse that overlays a different form onto the target. Like my Yin Soul Ghost Curse, it seems to require a lot of experience in transforming into different forms to master it."

"Oh... So it's not a technique to become a dragon?"

"No, it is. Some curses are permanent. Essentially, the core of the Dragon Transformation Technique is to refine oneself into a dragon through a curse."

"Oh...!"

She seemed to have a realization and thanked me profusely.

"Thank you, senior!"

With the clue I provided, she immediately sat in a lotus position and focused her consciousness. A purple light seemed to emanate from her body, and her cultivation level slightly increased.

After glancing at Yukyo, I turned my attention back to the latter half of the Dragon Transformation Technique.

'If this is a curse, can't it be reversed like the Yin Soul Ghost Curse or the Black Blood Flower?'

I had a feeling I knew what would happen if I reversed this curse.

Wooong-

The technique that overlays another's form onto oneself, weakening in the process. If reversed, it would become a technique that strengthens oneself while maintaining one's original form!

I excitedly reversed the latter half of the Dragon Transformation Technique. The first half, which involved refining and cultivating the dragon's energy, was akin to setting the target for the curse. Since the target was 'me,' the latter half alone was sufficient for reversal!

Paaaat!

A hazy energy seemed to emanate from the Dragon Transformation Technique and enveloped my body. I looked around my body. Nothing had changed. My current form, with the 19-headed demon king I obtained from the Great Sea of Stars, remained the same.

'This reversed technique might be useful when I reach the Fusion stage.'

Creating a domain in the Fusion stage requires a clear sense of self.

'The enhancement effect of the Dragon Transformation Technique... doesn't mean much to me.'

It might be helpful for those in the Celestial Human or ordinary Sacrifice stages, but it wasn't significant for someone like me who had obtained the Three-Talented Diagram.

At that moment.

"Hmm?"

Boom!

A massive light bomb collided with the barrier of the Guangyin Domain. It was an attack at the peak of the Celestial Human stage.

"Who are these guests?"

I chuckled and stood up from my seat. Yukyo, startled, hid inside the Wujigyo Hall. I floated into the sky above the Guangyin Domain, crossed my arms, and looked around. Countless Sacrifice and Celestial Human cultivators surrounded the area.

I glanced at the nearby Xingrandao. Somehow, a powerful figure had stealthily infiltrated Xingrandao.

'Fusion stage early phase. This is troublesome.'

The person had excellent stealth skills. Although not as good as my improved Moonlight Palace Stealth Technique, it was still challenging to detect without vigilance.

'It seems to be a limited stealth technique that can only be used once and requires a long cooldown.'

I quickly sent a transmission to the entire Wujigyo Sect, issuing a state of alert, and shouted loudly. Most of the Sacrifice stage aquatic tribe cultivators flinched at my appearance. I moved my 19 heads, making a cracking sound, and ignited ghostly flames in my 38 eyes. Although I didn't like this form, it was perfect for intimidating the enemy.

At my threat, one of the Sacrifice stage aquatic tribe cultivators stepped forward and shouted.

Rumble-

I grinned and revealed my ghostly energy. Ghostly energy surged from my 19 heads, filling the surrounding sea area with ghostly energy in an instant.

Screeeech-

Countless cursed dolls crawled out from all over the Guangyin Domain, emitting ghostly wails.

Rumble!

The celestial energy twisted violently due to my power, shaking the entire nearby space as if it would tear apart. The gravitational force of the Sacrifice stage cultivators was nullified by my power, causing some who were flying with gravitational force to almost fall from the sky. Their faces darkened. They seemed to have roughly gauged my level.

I spoke with ghostly flames burning in my 38 eyes.

At my words, about 48 Sacrifice stage cultivators hesitated and retreated, while the hundreds of Celestial Human cultivators looked distressed and considered fleeing.

'Good, we can resolve this peacefully.'

I smiled inwardly. If I gave them a fierce impression, they might back off. Although I didn't know about the hidden Fusion stage cultivator, dealing with one of them wouldn't be a problem.

I thought so.

Flash!

Suddenly, a golden figure appeared above the Wujigyo Hall, carried by a gust of wind. Wearing a black hat and black martial robes, with an old sword at his waist, and an all-too-familiar presence.

I stared at the man with a blank expression.

'Ah...'

I had momentarily forgotten. He existed in this world.

Ignoring the pests eyeing the Guangyin Domain, I jumped down in front of Kim Younghoon, who had landed on the roof of the Wujigyo Hall.

Boom!

In my excitement, I didn't control my strength, causing part of the roof to collapse and dust to rise. I smiled brightly at him and spoke.

And.

"......"

He looked at me with a puzzled expression.

"...Do I know you?"

After reaching the Celestial Human stage, it became difficult to read each other's presence due to the ability to compress one's presence. I laughed heartily and spoke.

"......"

Kim Younghoon glared at me suspiciously.

"...Are you really Seo Eunhyun? Sorry, but I've met a lot of imitators who mimic others' memories and appearances after coming to the high-power realm."

"......"

Despite my words, Kim Younghoon didn't erase his suspicion and asked.

"The last time I met Seo Eunhyun, he wasn't a lunatic who displayed someone else's skull on his shoulder."

I laughed heartily and tried to release my ghostly transformation. Or so I thought.

'Huh.'

The ghostly transformation didn't release. I was flustered but quickly found the reason.

'The Dragon Transformation Technique!!!'

The reversed curse of the Dragon Transformation Technique was fixing my current form. It would take some time to release the technique.

Kim Younghoon looked at me with a slightly suspicious face and asked.

"To me, you look like a monster that devoured my subordinate and is mimicking him."

And he grinned.

"To confirm whether you're really Seo Eunhyun or a monster mimicking him..."

Wooong-

A golden light emanated from his sword.

"There's only one way."

He lit up his eyes.

"Come at me. If you're Seo Eunhyun, we'll have to spar anyway. If you're a monster that devoured him, I'll have to cut you down."

Yes, meeting him like this is always the best. I drew the Colorless Glass Sword from my mouth.

'It's been about 700 years since the fight with Hong Suryeong.'

At the time of the fight with her, each Colorless Glass Sword was at the level of a mid-grade artifact. Over the centuries, the Colorless Glass Sword had been slowly refined in the single flame. Over 100 years, it became a high-grade artifact. Over another 100 years, it became a top-grade artifact. Over another 100 years, it finally became an artifact at the level of a decisive stage artifact! Over the next 200 years, it became an artifact at the level of a decisive stage peak artifact. That was the Colorless Glass Sword at the end of the last cycle, and after 230 years of refining in this cycle, each Colorless Glass Sword had finally become an artifact at the level of the Origin stage.

Wooong-

The Colorless Glass Sword vibrated.

Shing!

3,000 Colorless Glass Swords combined into 10 swords each. 3,000 swords became 300 swords. The artifacts at the Origin stage level became artifacts at the peak of the Origin stage. 300 swords became 30 swords. The artifacts at the peak of the Origin stage became artifacts at the Celestial Human stage. 30 swords became 3 swords. The artifacts at the Celestial Human stage became artifacts at the peak of the Celestial Human stage. Finally, 3 swords combined into 1, revealing the final form of the Colorless Glass Sword, the Total Heaven Form.

Paaaat!

The artifact at the peak of the Celestial Human stage had now risen to the level of an artifact used by Sacrifice stage cultivators. My Colorless Glass Sword, refined in the single flame for thousands of years, was now at the level of an artifact used by Sacrifice stage cultivators, even without its artifact functions, purely based on its strength and inherent sharpness. Even if martial skills were equal, the quality of the weapon could make a difference. However, Kim Younghoon didn't seem tense as he placed his hand on his old sword.

Wooong!

I looked at him with shining eyes.

"In the high-power realm, there are so many treasures lying around in the sea. I've developed a hobby."

A spatial wave emanated from his old sword, and the sword began to emit light. Simultaneously, dozens and hundreds of swords and sabers were embedded in the roof of the Wujigyo Hall around us. What he had was a sword-shaped artifact.

"These are famous demonic swords and enchanted sabers from the high-power realm. They're my cherished collection. Let me ask you in return."

Tssst!

Golden light flared from his eyes. I chuckled at the demonic and enchanted energy I felt around me. The sword energy of these sinister swords was all connected to Kim Younghoon. He had succeeded in dominating all these evil swords.

"Can you handle these infamous swords with that seemingly ordinary sword of yours?"

I just grinned.

Boom!

I took a step forward. Now, words were unnecessary. Kim Younghoon and I clashed, and taking advantage of the chaos, the Sacrifice stage cultivators rushed towards the Guangyin Domain.

* * *

The demon cultivator Heukgin, a demon cultivator of the Weizheng Sea, bared his sharp teeth and charged towards the Guangyin Domain. The cursed dolls tried to block him, but it was futile.

"Hahaha! You evil beings! Give me treasures and glory!"

As he broke through the barrier of the Guangyin Domain and entered, he was pushed back by a massive figure.

"Who are you!"

He saw a giant figure emitting starlight. The giant figure, drawing purple energy from its entire body, roared.

The guardian law of the Wujigyo Sect, the Annihilation Ghost King Oh Hyunseok, led 13 guardian ghost kings to defend the Guangyin Domain. The guardian law and the guardian ghost kings clashed with the Celestial Human and Sacrifice stage cultivators targeting the Guangyin Domain.

* * *

The early Fusion stage cultivator Taesu, who had been hiding in Xingrandao, revealed himself and entered the Guangyin Domain. He smiled wickedly and searched for Yukyo.

'While these bugs are buying time, I'll find Yukyo and the hostages and leave.'

He flew towards the place where he sensed Yukyo's energy.

"Is it here?"

Boom!

He crushed a building, distorting space. Inside the building, Yukyo was trembling, and a man with a haggard appearance was carefully stroking a well-fried hand.

"Here you are, princess. Let's go together."

Ignoring the haggard man, he approached Yukyo. But then.

Chill!

Taesu flinched and stepped back.

'What was that just now?'

He had seen a vision of his entire body being fried. He assumed the vision came from the haggard man and made eye contact with him.

"So, you're the one protecting the hostages?"

The man's face twisted into a demonic grin.

"Did you... interrupt my time with [Sohai]?"

"What?"

"You bastard... I'll fry you to death, leaving only your hands...!"

Thus, Taesu clashed with the Wujigyo Sect's great guardian law, the Six Ghost King Jeon Myunghun.

* * *

The guardian law Hongbeom and the left guardian law Kim Yeon were monitoring the barrier and observing the entire Guangyin Domain from the underground of the Wujigyo Hall. At that moment, Hongbeom looked up at the sky.

"What! What is this!"

"Stay here for a moment, Hongbeom."

Kim Yeon, with
