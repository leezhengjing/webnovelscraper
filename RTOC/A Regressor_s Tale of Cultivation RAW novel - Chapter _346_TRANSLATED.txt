The Deceased (7)

A dark basement.

“Phew, it's all done now.”

“Good, now it will be complete once we engrave that.”

A monster with 38 eyes and a woman standing next to it smiled as they looked at a small doll in front of them. The doll was in the shape of a little girl. Inside it, the sect leader of the Wei Yin Sect, Yinwa, was sealed and trembling with rage.

“You vile demonic cultists, what do you plan to do after turning me into this?!”

“Hoho, don't worry. We won't do anything too drastic. Just stay calm.”

“Don't worry, as long as you behave, we won't harm you.”

Kim Yeon picked up Yinwa. Yinwa struggled wildly in Kim Yeon's hand, but the sealing spells embedded in the puppet sealed all her power, rendering her helpless.

“You should be grateful. If you had continued to face the cult leader in your original form, you might have gone completely mad.”

Yan Wei, who had come down to the basement at some point, leaned against the wall and spoke to Yinwa.

“The spirit inside the puppet is prevented from fully perceiving the cult leader's true death. The fact that you can still think clearly instead of screaming mindlessly is thanks to the cult leader's grace.”

“Grr, you demonic cultists! What are you babbling about after turning me into this?! Release me at once!”

“Hm. Hand her over for a moment, Yeon.”

Yan Wei took Yinwa from Kim Yeon and then threw her somewhere.

“Ah! Where are you throwing me, you demonic cultists?!”

Someone with thick hands caught the thrown Yinwa.

“From now on, the influence of the Wei Yin Sect leader will be entrusted to you, First Guardian King Wei Shihon.”

“Thank you, strategist.”

It was Wei Shihon, the sect leader of the Shi Hu Sect, who had decided to dedicate himself to the Wuji Sect.

“Wei Shihon! You traitor! How could you betray me?!”

Yinwa wriggled and shouted in Wei Shihon's hand, and Wei Shihon looked at her with pity.

“I joined the Wuji Sect for your sake. If you change your mind about the Wuji Sect, you will receive a proper puppet body and be engraved with the cult leader's grace, gaining even greater power than before.”

“I don't want to hear anything from a traitor who betrayed us for power! Release me at once!”

“Releasing you is a matter for later. For now, let's learn about the Wuji Sect together.”

Wei Shihon took Yinwa and left. As he exited the Wuji Sect's main hall, he carefully held the struggling Yinwa and moved somewhere. At that moment, the sky turned red, and Jeon Myunghun landed next to Wei Shihon. In Jeon Myunghun's hand was a pure white skull. Yinwa saw this and cried out in despair.

“Baek Liin!!! Even you!!!”

However, unlike the sealed Yinwa, Wei Shihon seemed to notice something and asked Jeon Myunghun.

“Wait, Great Guardian. That skull is….”

“Yes, I lost him.”

Jeon Myunghun nodded indifferently and raised the skull. Yinwa sighed in relief in Wei Shihon's hand, and Wei Shihon frowned.

“I explained about Baek Lin before. In an emergency, he can abandon his body and escape with his soul using the life-saving technique 'White Bone Escape.'”

Jeon Myunghun looked at Wei Shihon and spoke.

“I did explain that he could abandon his body and escape with his soul.”

“Yes! But how did you lose him?!”

“But I didn't mention that his soul could split into thousands of pieces and each piece could use teleportation to escape.”

“Um…! That, that’s… a divine technique that can only be used at the peak of the White Bone Escape…?”

Jeon Myunghun clicked his tongue.

“It seems he mastered the life-saving technique without you knowing. Anyway, I was a bit surprised since it was my first time seeing that technique, so I lost him. I won't lose him next time.”

Despite Jeon Myunghun's words, Wei Shihon only sighed deeply.

“This has become complicated….”

“What’s complicated?”

“Baek Lin once received a favor from an elder of the Black Bone Palace during his celestial period. With time, that elder would have become a black elder of the Black Bone Palace. He might challenge our sect with the support of the Black Bone Palace.”

“Hmm….”

Jeon Myunghun seemed to ponder for a moment before smiling.

“Well, it doesn't matter. We have the cult leader, don't we?”

Wei Shihon sighed as he looked at Jeon Myunghun, who had absolute trust in the cult leader, but then he thought of Seo Eunhyun. A being with 19 heads and 38 eyes.

‘Well… if it's the cult leader, it might be okay.’

Wei Shihon looked back at Jeon Myunghun entering the Wuji Sect's main hall, then turned and took Yinwa to another part of the Wuji Sect.

* * *

“Hmm, the Black Bone Palace….”

In the basement of the Wuji Sect's main hall, the Wuji Ghost King Seo Eunhyun tapped the armrest of his throne.

“What do you think, Yan Wei?”

Yan Wei shook his head at Jeon Myunghun's report.

“There's nothing to worry about. This Baek Yin Territory is a non-aggression zone between the Penglai Island and the Ghost Palace. If the Black Bone Palace or the Fire Sword Heaven Palace tries to intervene here, the Ghost Palace and Penglai Island will block them. They won't let another major force take what they couldn't have. We might even get support from the Ghost Palace or Penglai Island if the Black Bone Palace comes.”

“Hmm, I see.”

Seo Eunhyun nodded at the report.

“Then, for now, it’s best to focus on slowly building our power without making any rash moves?”

“Yes, that would be best. Slowly, but quickly, take advantage of the Wuji Sect's puppet supply to swallow the Baek Yin Territory. Even if Baek Lin brings the Black Bone Palace, if you control the Baek Yin Territory, they will have no choice but to acknowledge your control and retreat. Hahaha….”

“Understood. For the next 200 years, we will focus on building our power and consolidating our position without making any rash moves.”

After stopping the intruders, the short meeting at the Wuji Sect's main hall ended.

* * *

Buzz, buzz, buzz!

After the meeting, Kim Yeon went to her assigned training ground and began her exercises.

‘How can I understand this feeling?’

She thought it might be as simple as distinguishing the colors of emotions seen through the Five Senses of the Mind. But strangely, the color of the emotions Kim Yeon felt was 'colorless.'

She couldn't understand what her emotions were.

‘Joy is gold, anger is red, sadness is dark blue, pleasure is silver, love is light pink, hatred is dark red, and desire is black.’

These were the colors she had seen through the Five Senses of the Mind and the Five Senses of the Heart. When she reached the Five Senses of the Mind, she confirmed that the colors merged into colorlessness, forming the realm of consciousness.

So, the colorless emotion she saw should have been 'all emotions.' But Kim Yeon knew.

‘It's different, it's not all emotions.’

Although it was the same colorless emotion she saw when she reached the Five Senses of the Mind, Kim Yeon could tell that the colorless emotion she felt was quite unique and special.

‘What is this emotion?’

She instinctively felt that the day she discovered the 'name' of this emotion, she would see its true color.

“Phew….”

She repeated the Biikmu. At the same time, she repeatedly practiced the internal energy method of the Yeonrijisim, becoming more familiar with it.

Wooong—

The pure energy of the Yeonrijisim swirled through her meridians at a terrifying speed.

Wooong—

Kim Yeon reached out into the air. As she infused her consciousness into the pure energy, it moved according to her will.

The initial stage of mastering the energy. It was said that practicing infusing energy into the air and controlling it freely would lead to the realm of the Peak of the Phoenix.

‘If I reach the Peak of the Phoenix, I will become overwhelmingly strong.’

Seo Eunhyun had said so. Kim Yeon would become incredibly strong if she started using the acceleration of the Peak of the Phoenix with her level of consciousness.

Seo Eunhyun's words were not wrong. If she, with her level of consciousness, started using the acceleration of the Peak of the Phoenix, her direct combat power would be amplified to an unbelievable extent.

But as she practiced the Yeonrijisim, she thought.

‘If I become overwhelmingly strong, will I be able to find the name of this emotion?’

Her quest to find the name of the emotion was not just for self-satisfaction. According to the Five Senses of the Heart, once she mastered it, there should be no consciousness she couldn't read. But there was one consciousness she couldn't read.

Therefore, she hadn't yet mastered the Five Senses of the Heart.

‘I must master the Five Senses of the Heart.’

The Ghost King had left her an artifact containing enlightenment. Kim Yeon knew that to obtain the enlightenment to stop the Ghost King, she had to master the Five Senses of the Heart.

But sometimes, she was confused. Was she trying to find the name of the emotion for the Five Senses of the Heart, or was she trying to master the Five Senses of the Heart to find the name of the emotion?

‘…I don't know.’

She repeated the Biikmu. Repeating, repeating, and repeating again.

‘If I don't know, I'll just do as Eunhyun oppa said.’

Even if she didn't know, he would surely be right. He always had been.

Step by step, she recalled her old memories.

* * *

“Hello, I'm Oh Hyesuh, the new manager joining us today. Please call me Manager Oh.”

Shortly after she became an employee, someone from a neighboring department transferred to her department. It was Oh Hyesuh, who had been bullied in her previous department. The main instigator, a team leader, had been disciplined and fired, and Oh Hyesuh had requested a transfer due to the trauma.

“Oh, that must have been tough.”

“Not really. Everyone except Team Leader Lim was nice to me.”

From the first day of her transfer, Oh Hyesuh spoke to Kim Yeon, and they quickly became friends.

“I don't know much about the sales development department, so please teach me well, Kim Yeon.”

“Oh, no. I'm just an employee, and you're a manager….”

“Still, those who were here first are better, right? Isn't that right, Minhee?”

Kang Minhee, sipping her coffee, glanced at her and answered with a blank expression.

“Yes, well.”

“…It makes me sad when you give such short answers.”

Seeing Kang Minhee's indifferent response, Oh Hyesuh pretended to cry and joke, which seemed to endear her to the male employees in the department.

During lunch, Kim Yeon talked about Oh Hyesuh while eating a hamburger with Kang Minhee.

“Minhee unni, isn't Manager Oh amazing? Despite being bullied, she always stays so cheerful….”

“Hmm….”

Kang Minhee chewed on her fries indifferently.

“She… feels really off.”

“Huh? Why?”

“Well, I saw Team Leader Lim apologizing to her before he left. He was crying, saying he didn't know why he bullied her and that he was sorry for not taking care of her. He seemed genuinely remorseful.”

“Oh, why would someone like that bully….”

“That's what's strange. I know Team Leader Lim a bit, and he's a really kind person. He's soft-hearted, loves animals, and volunteers at an orphanage. He was even scheduled for a promotion. So why would someone like that bully Manager Oh?”

Kim Yeon stole some of Kang Minhee's fries and thought.

“Maybe he just didn't like her at first sight?”

“No way. Even if he didn't like her at first, working together in this company would make them close. I don't think there was any real bullying.”

“Then what was it?”

“That's… by the way, where did my fries go?”

Despite hearing some unsettling words from Kang Minhee during lunch, Kim Yeon still felt a strong liking for Oh Hyesuh. In fact, Oh Hyesuh was liked by everyone. Soon, Kim Yeon forgot Kang Minhee's words and became close to Oh Hyesuh. Oh Hyesuh was also very capable, becoming the top elite in the department within three days of her transfer, surpassing even Kang Minhee.

Before long, Oh Hyesuh and Kim Yeon were calling each other sister. Although Seo Eunhyun's tasks were always difficult, Oh Hyesuh always took on the hard tasks herself, leaving the easy ones for Kim Yeon, so naturally, Kim Yeon talked more with Oh Hyesuh than with Seo Eunhyun.

“Ah, Hyesuh unni. I finished this.”

“Hmm, thanks. Oh, Yeon, you made a mistake here.”

“Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.”

“It's okay, we're close.”

Oh Hyesuh always overlooked her mistakes. But Seo Eunhyun was different.

“Kim, this document name is wrong.”

“I'm sorry.”

“The format is also a bit off. Did you use the B12 format I gave you?”

“Actually… I used a different one. I'm sorry.”

“I told you to use that format. Why did you use a different one?”

“I'm sorry.”

‘Hyesuh unni always asked for this format….’

“Do it again.”

Receiving the document from the stern Seo Eunhyun and starting over, Kim Yeon pouted slightly.

At first, it was like that. But over time, something started to feel off.

“Oh, Yeon, you made a mistake again.”

“Oh, did I?”

Oh Hyesuh always found mistakes in her work. But at some point, Seo Eunhyun stopped saying anything.

“Ah, thank you. You can go now.”

“Um… Manager?”

“Yes?”

“Didn't I make any mistakes?”

“No, there are no mistakes.”

“But someone else said this was wrong…?”

“Who said that?”

“Manager Oh….”

“Oh… Hyesuh? Hmm? I don't see any mistakes. Maybe she pointed out something else?”

After flipping through the document for a moment, Seo Eunhyun shook his head.

“Yeon, there's nothing wrong with this. Maybe Hyesuh pointed out something else?”

“Oh… I must have remembered wrong. I'm sorry.”

“No worries, you've been very helpful lately.”

As her skills improved, Seo Eunhyun no longer scolded her. But Oh Hyesuh continued to point out non-existent mistakes and laugh them off.

‘Why?’

Feeling something was off, Kim Yeon let it slide. But an incident involving Oh Hyesuh occurred after a company dinner. Everyone was a bit tipsy, and Kim Yeon was particularly woozy. Before everyone parted ways, she saw Oh Hyesuh following Seo Eunhyun.

‘Huh? What’s Hyesuh unni….’

She followed Oh Hyesuh, initially just to say goodbye. But at some point, Oh Hyesuh disappeared.

‘…?’

It was as if she had hidden in the darkness, and Kim Yeon couldn't see her. But the scent of Oh Hyesuh's perfume lingered. She was definitely nearby. The scent led her to Seo Eunhyun. In a trance, she followed Seo Eunhyun, trying to find Oh Hyesuh. But Seo Eunhyun noticed her first.

“…Uh….”

“…Yeon?”

Caught in the act, Kim Yeon stood there with a dumbfounded expression.

‘I was following Hyesuh unni….’

The situation felt strange. Seo Eunhyun, looking a bit puzzled, asked her.

“Why are you here?”

For a moment, Kim Yeon was speechless. She had always found Seo Eunhyun a bit intimidating, and now it seemed like she was caught stalking him.

“Uh… well….”

‘I was following Hyesuh unni because she was stalking you….’

She wanted to say that, but what came out was different.

“Hye… Hye… suh… stalking….”

And Seo Eunhyun, after interpreting her words, said something shocking.

“You were stalking me?”

“Ah, no….”

Fortunately, Seo Eunhyun laughed.

“Haha, just kidding. You must be too drunk to speak properly. Come here, I'll help you. So… you need help because someone is stalking you, right?”

“Uh….”

She wanted to explain, but she was too nervous or too drunk to speak. Unable to explain, she just nodded.

Thud!

“Uh….”

“Yeon, you can't walk?”

“…Ugh….”

“Sigh… I'll call a taxi for you. Can you walk to the bus stop?”

Feeling sick, she shook her head. She felt wronged. She had just followed Oh Hyesuh, but now she was in this situation with her least favorite superior. Seo Eunhyun sighed and carried her on his back.

“I'll carry you to the bus stop. I'll call a taxi there….”

“…Manager… thank….”

As she was carried to the bus stop, a mix of drunkenness and sadness welled up inside her, and she poured it all out on Seo Eunhyun's back.

“Tha… thank… bleegh….”

“Ahhh! Yeon! What are you doing?!”

After that, she didn't remember much. Seo Eunhyun screamed in shock, then checked her condition and asked if she was okay. He asked for her address several times, and when she couldn't answer, he took her to a nearby motel and gently laid her down.

“Sigh… I hope this washes out.”

Half-asleep, she mumbled.

“Sorry….”

“It's okay. You were drunk. Just get some rest. I set an alarm on your phone, so make sure you get to work on time tomorrow. If you can't, at least call in. The room key is next to you.”

After finishing his words, Seo Eunhyun left the room. Although she had been nervous about going to a motel, nothing happened.

‘Ah, Manager Seo. Really….’

She thought about Seo Eunhyun as she lay in bed.

‘Thank… you….’

Soon after, she fell asleep. That night, she had a nightmare. In the nightmare, she woke up to find someone stroking her hair and measuring her nails with a ruler. The figure hummed a cheerful tune, but its eyes were chillingly emotionless. The figure smelled strongly of roses, the same scent as Oh Hyesuh's perfume. She wanted to scream, but her mouth was sealed in the dream. The black figure opened her mouth, counted her teeth, and then disappeared.

It was a nightmare she never wanted to have again, but morning came, and she remembered the events of the previous night, feeling like she was going crazy.

“…Should I just die?”

‘What did I do to Manager Seo?’

She went
