How have you been? (1)

Whiiiii—

A desolate desert. Not filled with golden sand, but with dry, unpleasant ash-gray sand. This place was one of the regions of the Chaotic Realm, known as the Dead Soil Region. A group of figures appeared there. They were all dressed in black robes embroidered with golden threads depicting ascending dragons. The leader, who appeared to be a young boy, was a cultivator from the Black Scale Spirit Sect. The cultivator, who was a Xuan Gui, smiled as he looked around.

"Let's see... Investigator Seo said to meet here..."

At that moment, his gaze landed on a spot.

"Ah, there you are. Haha, how have you been, Investigator Seo? You’ve changed a lot since I last saw you."

Rustle—

The Xuan Gui's gaze was fixed on the ash-gray desert. From beneath it, a demon king with eighteen heads emerged. It was Seo Rip.

* * *

I took a deep breath and reverted my demon king-transformed body back to human form. The Xuan Gui looked at me with a glint in his eyes.

"Amazing. Did you hide your skills the last time we met? Well, that curse wasn't something a mere Yuan Ying cultivator could handle, but I never expected you to be a mid-stage Sha Chu cultivator."

He seemed to have judged me as a 'senior' and respectfully clasped his hands together.

"No need for such formalities. I'm just a mid-stage Sha Chu cultivator. And..."

I looked at the three men in black robes standing behind the Xuan Gui and smiled.

"The people behind you seem quite formidable as well. You must be quite impressive to lead such individuals."

Behind the Xuan Gui stood three cultivators who appeared to be from the Tian Ren Qi. However, I did not underestimate them just because they were from the Tian Ren Qi.

'The Black Scale Spirit Sect's Four Elements Yuan Ying...'

I was well aware of the prowess of the Black Scale Spirit Sect's cultivators from the War of Humans and Demons. They could use the power of their bloodline through the Four Elements Yuan Ying techniques, making them masters of absorbing external power.

'The Black Scale Spirit Sect's cultivators always borrow external power through their Four Elements Yuan Ying techniques, surpassing their limits.'

The ones behind him were not just Tian Ren Qi members but were essentially early-stage Sha Chu cultivators. Moreover, the seven Yuan Ying cultivators who followed the Xuan Gui showed no signs of tension or fear when looking at me. They seemed to show respect, but their mental waves did not convey any sense of reverence or fear.

'The Black Scale Spirit Sect, including the Xuan Gui, are all hiding something.'

I remained vigilant, exchanging greetings with the Xuan Gui while preparing to escape their range at any moment.

"By the way, what were you doing in the sand, Senior Seo?"

"Ah, this Dead Soil Region is a suitable place for my cultivation."

The Dead Soil Region, made of ash-gray sand, was a perfect match for the Great Desert Sea Star technique. The Great Desert Sea Star technique not only turned the surroundings into a desert but also trained the energy of death. The Dead Soil Region, filled with the energy of death, was the ideal place to train the Great Desert Sea Star technique.

"Ho, I see. As expected of a Sha Chu senior. To seek the path of cultivation even in such a place. It's reassuring."

"Haha, no need to flatter me."

We laughed heartily and flew to the western part of the Dead Soil Region.

"Hmm, as expected of the Chaotic Realm, the heavenly energy is chaotic."

I stopped using the flight technique and began to manipulate the gravitational force.

"I plan to use the Shrinking Earth technique from now on. What about the Black Scale Spirit Sect members? Will you accompany me?"

At my question, they looked at each other and nodded. The Xuan Gui smiled and conveyed their decision.

"We would be very grateful if you could do that. Please take care of us."

I grabbed the Xuan Gui and the Black Scale Spirit Sect members with gravitational force and stimulated the axis of wealth I had accumulated.

Wooooong!

A powerful gravitational force emerged from the axis, folding space. I took a step forward.

Paaat!

With each step, the distance shortened by 500 li. I moved step by step using the Shrinking Earth technique. Our destination was the western edge of the Dead Soil Region. As we moved further away from the Safe Realm, the heavenly energy became more chaotic.

'In the Chaotic Realm, those below the Tian Ren Qi will have their combat power greatly restricted.'

The Guang Han Realm was divided into the Chaotic Realm and the Safe Realm. The Safe Realm was a land where the heavenly energy was stable, and living beings could live normally. In contrast, the Chaotic Realm was a place where the heavenly energy was so chaotic and the laws so twisted that it was close to a demonic realm. Generally, when people referred to the Guang Han Realm, they meant the Safe Realm, which was vast. However, even that was just a speck compared to the Chaotic Realm.

'The entire Safe Realm is about the size of the solar system... or maybe larger. If that's the case, the Chaotic Realm must be about the size of a galaxy.'

The Human Territory, the True Dragon Alliance Territory, and other areas were in the Safe Realm, while all other regions were in the Chaotic Realm. I compared the size of the Guang Han Realm in my mind.

'The Heart Tribe Territory is said to be very far in the Chaotic Realm. I wonder how they live in such a place.'

The further one moved away from the Safe Realm, the more distorted the laws became, making it nearly impossible for living beings to survive. As I pondered the structure of the Guang Han Realm, I suddenly had a question and asked the Xuan Gui.

"By the way, have you ever thought about this, Investigator Xuan?"

"What thought?"

"They say there's only one Safe Realm in the vast Chaotic Realm, and most people don't even think about investigating the Chaotic Realm. But don't you think there might be other Safe Realms in the Chaotic Realm? Why doesn't anyone think about investigating the Chaotic Realm?"

At my words, the Xuan Gui put on a serious expression.

"Hmm, now that you mention it, that's true."

'Hmm?'

I realized that the Xuan Gui was outwardly serious but inwardly mocking me.

'Is this common knowledge?'

"Come to think of it, in other middle realms, there's only one Safe Realm as well. And the information that 'there's only one Safe Realm' comes from the Zun Zhe of the Sealing Stage and the Sheng Shi of the Saint Stage. Perhaps the great ones are hiding something."

"Hmm..."

'This guy...'

He was talking as if he had revealed a great secret, but his mental waves showed that he was looking down on me even more. I glanced at the other Black Scale Spirit Sect cultivators.

'They're not like that...'

Maybe the Xuan Gui knew something that the others didn't. I remained conscious of the Xuan Gui as we moved towards our destination.

About an hour later, we arrived at the edge of the Dead Soil Region using the Shrinking Earth technique.

"This place is..."

"Yes, it's the entrance to the Sunset Island of the Zhen Long Zhen Ren. Ah, there are other cultivators here as well."

The entrance to the Sunset Island was a large basin.

'This place...'

I looked around the basin, trying to gauge its nature.

'Judging by the remaining water energy, it seems there used to be a spring or oasis here.'

However, there were no spatial rifts or otherworldly spaces visible. I asked the Xuan Gui through a sound transmission.

I nodded and descended to the ground. Looking around, I saw several cultivators who appeared to be from the Tian Ren Qi had already arrived and taken their places. About fifty cultivators had arrived first, most of them from the Yao Tribe, with only about ten from the Tian Tribe. Among them were the Lizardmen from the Yeopta Tribe, who had adjacent territories to the Human Tribe, the Spirit Scale Tribe with green scales on their skin and strong in spiritual vision and stealth techniques, and the Han Ling Tribe, who had recently been destroyed by the Gui Jun.

'The Yeopta Tribe, Han Ling Tribe, Spirit Scale Tribe...'

The Yeopta Tribe lived under the watchful eye of the Human Tribe, the Han Ling Tribe had been friendly with the Human Tribe, but the Spirit Scale Tribe had a history of conflict with the Human Tribe. As I glanced at them, they all flinched and slowly backed away.

"Damn, those greedy humans. They brought a Sha Chu demon."

"As expected of the wicked humans, their aura is terrifying."

"Those ruthless human demons, how many lives did they consume to reach that level?"

"..."

They whispered among themselves, clearly afraid of me, and moved further away. 

'...This is the typical impression of humans, so there's no need to explain.'

I sighed softly and sat down, crossing my legs to begin cultivating the Great Desert Sea Star technique.

Crunch, crackle!

I transformed back into the demon king with eighteen heads and refined my demonic energy with the death energy of the Dead Soil Region. The other tribes trembled in fear at the sight of my transformation.

"That crazy human Sha Chu demon... He must have ripped off the heads of seventeen others and attached them to his shoulders."

"Such a vicious being. Let's not approach that demon."

"Humans are known to consume other tribes, but do they also have a custom of keeping the heads of other cultivators?"

"Shh, be quiet. Don't make eye contact...!"

The Tian Tribe fell silent in fear, and the Yao Tribe expressed their terror in their own language, thinking I couldn't understand. I considered explaining but decided it wouldn't help and remained silent.

How long did we wait at the entrance to the Sunset Island? Several more cultivators arrived, including three Sha Chu cultivators. I identified them through the information provided by the Xuan Gui.

A Sha Chu early-stage cultivator from the Blood Horn Tribe, Jiao Yan. A Sha Chu late-stage cultivator from the Bi Yi Tribe, Bai Wei Yi. A Sha Chu mid-stage cultivator from the Zhang Mu Tribe, Lu Zhu.

I received a sound transmission from the Xuan Gui and observed them closely. The Zhang Mu Tribe (丈木族) was the tribe to which the Green Armor Woodman, who had been repeatedly kidnapped by the Gui Jun, belonged. Although they seemed weak due to their history with the Gui Jun, they were actually a powerful tribe.

Among the thirteen major tribes of the Zhi Tribe, the Tian Tribe had six major tribes, which were as follows: Zhang Mu Tribe (丈木族), Bi Yi Tribe (比翼族), Human Tribe (人間族), Tu Gui Tribe (鬪鬼族), Fu Hu Tribe (腐鵂族), and Jun Hai Tribe (菌骸族).

These tribes were divided into three categories: the Two Heads (二頭), the Two Difficulties (二難), and the Two Evils (二惡).

The Two Heads (二頭) were the Zhang Mu Tribe and the Bi Yi Tribe, who led the Tian Tribe with their excellent judgment and symbolism. The Two Difficulties (二難) were the Fu Hu Tribe and the Jun Hai Tribe, known for their unique lifestyles and difficulty in dealing with. The Two Evils (二惡) were the Tu Gui Tribe and the Human Tribe, known for their ferocity and terrifying nature. The Tu Gui Tribe and the Human Tribe were so notorious for their ferocity and cruelty that they were collectively called the Asura Tribe (修羅族).

Among them, the Zhang Mu Tribe was highly respected throughout the Guang Han Realm for producing the Sheng Shi Bai Yun, and they became the center of the Tian Tribe due to their pride and symbolism. Although it was rumored that Bai Yun had no interest in his tribe and would even bring disaster upon them if they invaded his mountain, the Tian Lian Mountain, the Zhang Mu Tribe remained the center of the Tian Tribe.

'If the Zhang Mu Tribe and the Bi Yi Tribe join forces, it will be troublesome.'

I remained vigilant of the Bi Yi Tribe and the Zhang Mu Tribe cultivators. At the same time, I continued to cultivate the Great Desert Sea Star technique, emitting demonic energy from my eighteen heads and preparing for any situation.

Finally, the time came. I looked up at the sky, spitting out demonic energy from my eyes. It was the day of the Dark Night, when the stars of the Guang Han Realm lost their light for a short time, coinciding with the new moon. As the sun set, the sky gradually darkened. At the same time, water began to fill the basin. I watched the rising water level with demonic energy in my eyes.

I looked around to keep an eye on the other Sha Chu cultivators from different tribes. Strangely, they were all far away from me, sweating nervously.

'Hmm, what's going on?'

I tilted my eighteen heads, emitting demonic energy from my eyes.

* * *

In front of the entrance to the Sunset Island of the Zhen Long Zhen Ren, Seo Rip stood out the most, emitting blue demonic energy from his entire body as he absorbed the yin energy of the new moon. The terrifying appearance of Seo Rip, who was rumored to have ripped off the heads of seventeen other cultivators and attached them to his shoulders, his powerful demonic energy, and his unique aura built on true orthodox foundations made him the primary target of vigilance for all the tribes present.

The Sha Chu cultivator from the Zhang Mu Tribe, Lu Zhu, was already exchanging sound transmissions with the Sha Chu cultivator from the Bi Yi Tribe, Bai Wei Yi. The two Sha Chu cultivators from the Tian Tribe had joined forces, and the Sha Chu cultivator from the Blood Horn Tribe, Jiao Yan, was sending sound transmissions to all the Yao Tribe members present. The Yao Tribe members gathered around Jiao Yan.

Before long, four factions had formed around the basin. The human Black Scale Spirit Sect faction centered around the demon Seo Rip. The faction of the Zhang Mu Tribe and the Bi Yi Tribe, with mid-stage and late-stage Sha Chu cultivators. The Yao Tribe faction centered around the early-stage Sha Chu cultivator Jiao Yan. And a few other Tian Tribe members who did not belong to any faction. They all watched the rising water level and Seo Rip with tense eyes, waiting for the right moment.

Finally, the water filled the basin. The surface of the water reflected the dark night sky.

"It's coming. When we enter the Sunset Island, we will be scattered by a spatial storm, so I will take measures to bind us together."

The Xuan Gui from the Black Scale Spirit Sect took out a talisman and chanted a spell. A white rope emerged from the talisman, binding the Black Scale Spirit Sect members and Seo Rip together. The white rope glowed and then disappeared. The other factions also began to prepare for entering the Sunset Island.

After a while, a 'moon' began to rise on the surface of the water, reflecting the dark sky. Seo Rip looked up at the sky in wonder and then back at the water. The mysterious moon was only visible on the water's surface. On the surface of the moon, a faintly glowing ancient palace was depicted. After a while, the door of the ancient palace on the moon opened.

Creeeeak—

"Now! Let's go!"

Led by the Xuan Gui, the cultivators gathered there jumped into the water simultaneously, as if they had made a promise. Thus began the exploration of the Sunset Island of the Zhen Long Zhen Ren.

* * *

Paaat!

I protected myself from the spatial storm with gravitational force. The white rope used by the Xuan Gui emitted a faint gravitational force, keeping me and the Black Scale Spirit Sect members together.

'Amazing. To create an entrance to another realm in the reflection on the water's surface.'

I couldn't understand how it was done. After navigating through the spatial storm for a while, we eventually crossed numerous beams of light and landed in a desert. As I looked around in confusion, the Xuan Gui dusted himself off and spoke.

"It looks similar but isn't. This is the land reflected on the moon's surface. No, it's not even the moon. This land is an illusion created by the Zhen Long Zhen Ren, so it doesn't actually exist."

I picked up some sand from the ground and felt its texture. It was incredibly vivid. Even when I observed it with all my senses, it felt like 'real' sand. The Xuan Gui smiled.

"It's the technique of a quasi-immortal. Especially since the Zhen Long Zhen Ren was originally a great immortal who fell to the level of a quasi-immortal, he was said to be much stronger than other quasi-immortals. Now, let's move out of this area. We need to find the ancient palace we saw earlier to enter the true interior of the Sunset Island."

The Xuan Gui pointed to the sky.

"There are many ways to escape this type of illusion formation, but the most orthodox methods are two. One is to put yourself in a state of suspended animation to find the flaw in the illusion and exploit it. The other is to read the constellations. Any illusion technique that includes a 'sky' will always have constellations, so interpreting the constellations is the best way."

I looked up at the sky. However, the sky was just as dark as it had been in the Dead Soil Region, with no stars visible. Sensing my confusion, he spoke.

"Senior, try reading the heavenly energy."

I focused my eyes. Indeed, while there were no visible stars, I could read the heavenly energy. By tracing the heavenly energy, I could read the gravitational force and determine the constellations even without seeing the stars. The Zhi Tribe could probably read the gravitational force through the flow of heavenly energy.

'The method is simple, but the idea is not.'

It was a method that only a very experienced cultivator could think of. I felt an inexplicable sense of experience from the Xuan Gui and heightened my vigilance towards him. Following his guidance, I read the constellations and flew through the desert. Before long, we arrived at what seemed to be the center of the desert, guided by the constellations.

"The end of the Two Water Stars points to this place. Let's go a little further in this direction."

The Xuan Gui skillfully read the constellations and led us, and I followed him, feeling a sense of crossing a 'veil' at some point.

Paaat!

Suddenly, we were standing in front of a massive ancient palace in the middle of the desert. 

"It seems we are the first to arrive. Let's go in."

The Xuan Gui smiled and walked towards the entrance of the ancient palace. I looked up at the plaque hanging above the entrance. It read, "Kang Ning Feng Yang Shi Zhe Zhen Long Zhi Tu" (康寧奉養使者嶒龍之圖).

'Kang Ning Feng Yang Shi Zhe?'

It was an interesting title. However, I thought of the true orthodox foundation of Kang Ning and my eyes gleamed.

'Could it be related to the foundation?'

Considering the treasures the Xuan Gui had obtained here, it was highly likely. 

Step, step...

As we entered the ancient palace, the space twisted, and
