### Not a Monarch (3)

Seolip and Seo Eunhyun charged towards Seohul.

*Whoosh—*

The first attack came from Seo Eunhyun's sword. However, Seohul couldn't recognize it as a 'sword.'

"What is he swinging?"

To his eyes, it seemed like Seo Eunhyun was swinging at empty air. Even though Seo Eunhyun's original invisible sword was transparent, its outline could still be guessed. But now, Seohul couldn't discern what Seo Eunhyun was wielding.

*Shukang!*

Before Seohul could react, Seo Eunhyun had already torn through the moment and appeared in front of him, delivering thousands of slashes in an instant.

"...!"

Seohul, still smiling, began to use his magic calmly.

Magic. Dragon Sea's Advancing Moon.

*Shwaa—*

Water in the shape of a dragon was summoned around him and shot towards Seo Eunhyun and Seolip.

*Whoosh—*

However, behind Seo Eunhyun, Seolip transformed the blue-scaled armor covering his body into a giant arm. Seolip rushed forward and struck the dragon-shaped water.

*Boom!*

A loud explosion echoed as the dragon-shaped water shattered into pieces, creating a spray of water. A thick sea fog began to form around them.

* * *

*Wooooong—*

I tried to dispel the thick sea fog by exhaling a gust of wind, but the fog remained fixed in place, unmoving.

*Whisper, whisper, whisper...*

From somewhere far away, I heard the sound of something whispering.

"What is this?"

I tried to focus on the sound. At that moment,

*Whoosh—*

A white slash swept past in front of me. Following the path that split the fog, Seo Eunhyun walked towards me.

"Don't be deceived, Seolip. It's one of his brainwashing techniques."

"...The real body..."

"It's 'Seo Eunhyun,' Seolip."

"...Alright, Seo Eunhyun."

I asked, still confused, "Why do you insist on calling him that? It doesn't mean anything to us."

Seo Eunhyun gave a gentle smile. "You still don't know."

"...?"

"You'll understand naturally later."

He seemed calmer and more composed than before, as if he had experienced something inside Seohul.

"By the way, what is Seohul's ability? How did he parasitize so easily?"

I asked about Seohul, who had parasitized me and controlled my mind at will.

Seo Eunhyun's smile faded as he spoke. "His ability isn't parasitism."

"What?"

"His ability is 'infection' or 'replication'... or rather, 'assimilation' would be more accurate."

Seo Eunhyun explained, "He can disassemble his own mind. I don't know how it's possible, but he disassembles and decomposes his mind and spirit to create a specific arrangement. When that arrangement is assembled, it becomes the entity known as 'Seohul.' Anyone who encounters Seohul unconsciously imprints his 'arrangement' in their mind. Over time, that arrangement spreads throughout their mind, and at some point, it assembles into the entity known as 'Seohul.' It's a form of brainwashing."

I was astounded by the ability. "What... that plague-like ability. No, more importantly, can he use such an absurd technique without any restrictions?"

"From what I've found, there are restrictions. First, to brainwash someone stronger than himself through the 'arrangement,' it requires a significant amount of time and effort. That's why he killed beings like Gyo Yeom and Jang Mok-jok, who were powerful entities."

"I see..."

"Secondly, the weaker the person's mental strength, the easier it is to brainwash them. Conversely, the stronger the person's mental strength, the more resources are needed for the brainwashing."

"..."

I let out a hollow laugh at his words. Was my mental strength really that weak?

*Swish—*

Seo Eunhyun placed a hand on my shoulder. Since we were from the same country, it didn't feel unpleasant.

*Wooooong—*

In an instant, our minds connected, and I learned a startling fact.

"What?"

So, simply killing Seohul wouldn't end the brainwashing?

As I listened to the conditions for Seohul's brainwashing, I felt chills run down my spine. Seo Eunhyun's eyes seemed to burn with a fierce blue flame. He was wary of Seohul.

"Ah..."

So that's how it was. Seohul had been brainwashing me since the first cycle of regression. And from then until now, over approximately three thousand years, he had been brainwashing me. The result was the current 'me.'

It was simple for Seohul to read my thoughts. By that point, I was already being eroded by Seohul. The arrangements of Seohul within my consciousness were transmitting information to him. It was truly a terrifying ability.

"The Seohul you see there is both Seohul and the brainwashed 'me.'"

After transmitting his thoughts to me, Seo Eunhyun spoke aloud.

"The way to reclaim 'me' is simple. Either make him draw the Colorless Glass Sword, or cut open his belly and take out the Colorless Glass Sword, then use the Ten Thousand Connections Blade..."

Simultaneously, Seo Eunhyun's 'true' plan flowed into me through our connection.

*Whoosh!*

Seo Eunhyun swung his multicolored sword. The sea fog that had been enveloping us was completely torn apart and scattered.

*Rumble—*

Outside the fog, Seohul was seen diligently forming hand seals, preparing his next spell.

Magic. Water Compression of Three Hundred Million Tons.

*Shwaa—*

*Crack!*

Suddenly, the blue-scaled armor protecting my body became incredibly heavy.

Magic. Sea's Resentful Tears.

The tears of the raging sea poured down from the sky.

"Heh, even the Ten Thousand Connections Blade won't work on me. You two won't be able to approach me."

*Whoosh—*

I moved the now heavy blue-scaled armor, using it like an invisible sword to deflect all the falling water droplets. Seo Eunhyun raised his multicolored sword and spoke.

"In other words, 'I'm afraid of the Ten Thousand Connections Blade, so I'll make sure you can't approach me.'"

We exchanged glances. One word was enough.

"Let's go."

*Tap!*

I donned the blue-scaled armor, wielding the cursed sword, and surrounded myself with dark energy and yin energy. Using the power of the Great Desert Sea Star, I created a ghostly armor. Seo Eunhyun, without any protection, charged forward with the sword of light.

"Heh, my full power is currently at the fusion stage..."

In the next moment,

*Whoosh—*

*Thud!*

Seo Eunhyun's sword was thrust into Seohul's mouth. I grew accustomed to the heavy blue-scaled armor and began to wield it like an invisible sword.

*Shwaa!*

Despite the increased weight, the blue-scaled armor's strike, now heavier, surged towards Seohul.

*Flash!*

Seohul used the circuit of the monstrous army to enhance his physical abilities, drawing out the blood of the vanguard to further strengthen himself. He used the Five Elements True Core to create a barrier, increasing his power.

*Shwaa!*

The core barrier covered the Fengyang layer.

"This is..."

Perhaps because it was the Five Elements Core, Seohul's barrier was as solid and strong as the barrier of the fusion stage investigator, Weilingxian, rather than the barriers of the other monstrous army investigators.

The dark world I had seen before. It was a nauseating place, akin to Seohul's mental landscape. I was a bit flustered, but Seo Eunhyun, unfazed, skillfully navigated the darkness, delivering slashes.

"Heh, Seo Dou, you seem impatient. You're already slashing randomly. Are you afraid of my power within the core barrier?"

From the opposite side of where Seo Eunhyun had slashed, Seohul's mocking voice was heard. However, Seo Eunhyun wasn't deceived. He looked at the place where he had slashed and his eyes gleamed.

"In other words, 'How did you do that? I couldn't even perceive the slash. How can you exert such power within my core barrier?'"

"..."

I marveled at Seo Eunhyun's adept translation of Seohul's words.

"990 points in Seohul language..."

"...?"

"Oh, nothing... I just remembered how I used to boast about my TOEIC score of 900 in front of Kang Minhee, only to be overshadowed by her 990 score."

It was amazing to see myself so proficient in interpreting Seohul's language and the language of the monstrous army.

Seeing me, Seo Eunhyun smiled and focused his power on the sword of light, preparing for another slash.

"Seolip, you think about Kang Minhee a lot."

"Oh, no... I just remembered that incident. You... no, I was surprised at how proficient I've become in interpreting alien languages..."

"Do you love Kang Minhee?"

"No, why are you asking that all of a sudden? Kang Minhee is just..."

But seeing Seo Eunhyun's eyes, which seemed to say 'I know everything,' I couldn't hide it any longer.

"...Yes. I like Kang Minhee."

*Shwaa!*

Black chains emerged from the darkness, attacking us. I moved the blue-scaled armor to deflect the chains, and Seo Eunhyun accurately pinpointed Seohul's location in the darkness, striking him again. Seohul continued to mock us, saying, "Heh, where are you slashing? You can't even graze me." But neither of us paid any attention to his words.

Seo Eunhyun smiled gently. "Was it from then? When we started to diverge."

"Hmm?"

"Isn't it interesting? Love... I also liked Kang Minhee. As an old friend. But... I ended that love a long time ago. I still have lingering feelings, sometimes I miss her, and sometimes I remember watching the sunset together on Namsan... But now, I already have someone I love. But you, you still love Kang Minhee, don't you?"

"..."

"You are no longer me. Starting from your love for Kang Minhee, you have become 'Seolip,' independent from me."

*Roar—*

Numerous dark dragons charged at us, roaring. I unleashed a curse spell, while the main body delivered slashes, shredding them. We stood back to back.

I let out a bitter laugh. "Seolip... What a name. Not even Wonlip, it's really driving me crazy. Why did you name me Seolip?"

"For that, I truly apologize. You can apply for a name change later."

"It's fine. Seolip... isn't so bad."

I infused the entire blue-scaled armor with curse spells. The blue-scaled armor, now murky like black water, transformed into an invisible form and was fired in all directions. Seo Eunhyun also began to dance with his multicolored sword.

"It's not bad."

"That's a relief."

The black and white sword dance tore through the dark space. The combined power of the white sword and the black sword reached the level of a fusion stage grandmaster. And Seohul's barrier was torn apart.

* * *

I retrieved my sword. The surroundings had returned to the environment of the Fengyang layer. Seolip began to desertify the Fengyang layer using the power of the Great Desert Sea Star, and I approached Seohul with the invisible sword.

"You retrieved the cores before the barrier was damaged."

"..."

"Give up now. You can't defeat us."

Seohul smiled and took a step back. "Are you going to attack me?"

"Yes."

"Heh... Not bad. But I have something to tell you."

"Don't. Goodbye."

I prepared my sword stance. Seohul raised a finger and spoke.

"I told you before that I found the [Pillar] of the Ten Thousand Connections Blade."

I stopped in my tracks.

"I couldn't touch it until now because I needed the power of the monstrous army to obtain the [Pillar]... But heh... after fighting with Seo Dou, I finally..."

With a bright smile, he said, "I was able to reach the [Pillar]."

"..."

Seolip, behind me, looked flustered.

"Hey, Seo Eunhyun. What is he talking about?"

Seohul spread his arms wide and smiled broadly. "Now, shall we reveal Seo Dou's secret?"

*Shwaa—*

At the same time, he stimulated the Colorless Glass Sword, releasing the mist of the Ten Thousand Connections Blade. I was confused, just like Seolip.

'What is he talking about?'

There is no [Pillar] in the Ten Thousand Connections Blade. Or rather, to be precise, [everything] is the pillar. I had cherished and recorded every connection in my life as the pillar that made up my existence. So, what exactly was Seohul referring to as the [Pillar]?

* * *

Seohul navigated through the mist of the Ten Thousand Connections Blade using his power. Far away, he sensed it. Within the Ten Thousand Connections Blade, there was an entity that was particularly different and protected by the blade itself.

"Finally, I can glimpse Seo Dou's secret. This is truly delightful."

*Grab—*

Seohul grabbed the shoulder of [a certain entity] within the mist of the Ten Thousand Connections Blade.

"You are the memory Seo Dou cherishes the most. Reveal yourself to me."

Seohul, who had been eagerly anticipating peering into the secrets of the Ten Thousand Connections Blade, suddenly felt something strange.

"Hmm?"

*Swish—*

The entity, which Seohul thought was the [Pillar], was revealed from within the mist. It was a woman dressed in white, holding a jade ornament in one hand. Seohul, realizing something, took a step back with a smile.

"...Who are you?"

In response to his question, 'she' answered, "Just a wanderer. A traveler who came here while researching a treasure."

"...You are not the [Pillar]."

"I don't know what you're talking about. I just came here while exploring the connection with this ornament."

Seohul's gaze fell on the jade ornament she was holding.

"Ah, I see. Heh, it's not you, but 'that' which is the [Pillar]. Can you give it to me?"

"Well, it seems to play an important role in this space. But I can't give it to you."

"Why not?"

"Because... this space is whispering to me. Although I am a traveler, it says you are an uninvited guest."

"Hmm?"

"Though I can't act as the host, I can at least drive out an uninvited guest."

The woman in white smiled gently and raised the jade ornament.

"Heh, I don't know who you're calling an uninvited guest. We both entered the Ten Thousand Connections Blade without permission. Hand over the ornament."

Ignoring the woman in white, Seohul reached out to grab the ornament.

*Grab!*

Seohul's hand touched the jade ornament, gripping it tightly.

"Hmm?"

And then, Seohul saw it. The [Reversed Horn] inside the ornament.
