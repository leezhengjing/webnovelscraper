The hum of energy filled the air, and I felt my mind snap into sharp focus. How should I describe it? Although I was being pursued by Kang Minhee, I simultaneously saw another 'path.' And I felt as if the knowledge of how to walk this path was flowing directly into my mind. I could understand it. At this very moment, I knew how to traverse this path. I knew what I needed to do to walk it. This was a path forged by death and blood, a river of life and death.

'Ziyang Guangmagong, Bihon Jinmagong, Yeomma Bijeon, Shisik Birebon, Anhon Jinkyeol...'

I connected the peculiar Seongshimjeon to the consciousness of Biryul, seeking knowledge about demonic arts. While it was impossible to receive complete memories, I could grasp rough impressions. The demonic arts Biryul had seen, such as Bihon Jinmagong, Yeomma Bijeon, Shisik Birebon, and Anhon Jinkyeol, were all there. These were scenes from Biryul's memories, who had only 'seen' these demonic arts. I integrated these 'scenes' with the foundation of Gwiseon Gyumagyeol to unify the demonic arts.

The integration was swift. All the demonic arts, except for Eunram Magong and Yeomma Bijeon, merged into my mind. Absorption techniques like Bihon Jinmagong and Shisik Birebon, emission techniques like Ziyang Guangmagong, and ritual techniques like Anhon Jinkyeol—all these techniques were realized and unified within me based on Biryul's memories and Gwiseon Gyumagyeol.

I could devour all the demonic energy Kang Minhee emitted and instantly convert it into power. If I wished, I could weaken my opponent's strength to elevate my own realm. However...

'Is this path the right one?'

Before stepping onto the path, I suddenly questioned whether it was right for me to take this path. I didn't know why.

'No, it's not...'

Upon reflection, it was obvious.

'I still...'

I didn't want to sacrifice others. I didn't want to recklessly take from Kang Minhee or devour the demonic energy of those who had already died. The Dao is something that can only be obtained by becoming stronger and elevating oneself. It is something that can only be achieved by cutting oneself down, striving with the resolve to die by evening if one gains enlightenment in the morning. How could something obtained by sacrificing others become my strength? What belongs to others remains theirs. Taking it doesn't make it mine.

'Yes.'

I used the peculiar Seongshimjeon to extend my consciousness. I sent a signal to the living beings within a thousand li radius of Haneumtaek.

Thud, thud, thud!

The living beings of Haneumtaek, who received my signal, began to flee in terror. In fact, most of them had already fled when Kang Minhee started using her power. The remaining ones were at least at the level of decision-making spirits, capable of withstanding the aftermath of Kang Minhee's power. They used various techniques to quickly escape beyond a thousand li, and I used the technique I had just created.

'Then, let's not covet what belongs to others.'

I wouldn't take from others. Instead, I would borrow. And the target of my borrowing would be the natural world, not others. It would be the ownerless world.

Rumble!

The land of Haneumtaek, within a thousand li radius, began to wither. Even in the cold, the plants that had been growing steadfastly started to dry up. The life force of Haneumtaek began to wither due to the demonic art I created.

Demonic Art. Great Desert Dead Sea Formation.

Rustle—

In an instant, the land of Haneumtaek, within a thousand li radius, dried up and turned into a desert. Simultaneously, the life force and energy that flowed through Haneumtaek surged within me. A demonic art that didn't sacrifice anyone became my strength.

While I gained power by looking at the 'path,' I realized that I hadn't actually stepped onto the 'path.'

'Main body.'

I cooled my head and conveyed my will to the main body.

'Receive the secret art of the Myungui from Yeonwi. From now on, I will heal Kang Minhee.'

The secret art that Yeonwi used to heal Heonwon. After a while, the main body received the secret art from Yeonwi and transmitted it to me. The technique of sealing the spirit, Bongryeonghwi. It was a technique that forcibly drove a wedge into the torn spirit of the opponent to seal it.

'Main body, complete the Bongryeonghwi technique and pass it to me. I will challenge the Celestial Realm and then receive the technique to heal Kang Minhee.'

After conveying my opinion to the main body, I converted the energy gathered by the Great Desert Dead Sea Formation into magical power and prepared to reach the Celestial Realm.

Ping—

Kang Minhee's mental line targeted me. I quickly used the Mountain Moonlight Step to evade her attack.

'As expected, her skills have surpassed the first-rate level.'

She had always been like that. Suddenly, I felt a surge of emotion towards Kang Minhee.

* * *

'First-rate...'

Receiving Seorip's sentiment, I scoffed.

'Is it the influence of becoming a demonic king? Seorip has become too sentimental.'

It was an overreaction. Kang Minhee, first-rate? Absolutely not.

Clang, clang!

As I prepared the Bongryeonghwi technique received from Yeonwi, I recalled past memories. A translucent silver chain formed between my fingers. Like the Five Elements Blood Chain, the Bongryeonghwi technique was a half-spiritual technique. Therefore, I could complete it here and transmit it to Seorip through consciousness. However, I didn't convey my cynicism about Seorip to him.

'Seorip, who has become sentimental, is overestimating Kang Minhee.'

Useless emotions were distorting his memories. A cold evaluation of Kang Minhee was that she barely made it to the second-rate level during her time on Earth. Seorip was merely elevating his evaluation due to uncontrolled emotions.

'I will pass Bongryeonghwi to you, Seorip. Stay calm. Don't you think there's a problem with you right now?'

* * *

'A problem? With me?'

Indeed, my evaluation of Kang Minhee's skills might have been influenced by my memories. However, I thought the main body had become excessively cold. It was as if an ice block had settled in its head.

'...Understood. I will be cautious.'

Recognizing the suspicion, I received Bongryeonghwi from the main body. Simultaneously, I half-closed my eyes while evading Kang Minhee's mental attacks.

Tss, tss, tss—

However, I covered the surroundings with my consciousness. There is a difference between the consciousness realm of a martial artist and that of a cultivator. The realm of a cultivator is transparent. It is clear, but it can only sense and do nothing else. However, the realm of a martial artist is full of colors. It can see all colors. Among them, the red and blue lines are the most developed realms in combat.

The red realm is the area where all the paths the opponent might attack from overlap. The blue realm is the area where all the paths I can attack from overlap. Red and blue. These red and blue realms were most similar to the two colors of consciousness I knew. The anger and sorrow of the Seven Emotions. Anger is easy to understand. The hostility the opponent sends towards me is most similar to anger. Then, what does the dark blue color of sorrow and the blue color of my optimal path mean?

'Protection.'

The essence of sorrow is self-protection. Therefore, the consciousness extending from oneself is expressed as the blue consciousness optimized for protecting and guarding oneself. For some reason, I suddenly recalled a conversation I had with Taeyeoljeon. While discussing the Seven Fire Kings with her, she explained the Glass Guardian King like this:

—The Glass Guardian King, who wears armor made of lapis lazuli, is a king who protects and guards humans from pain and suffering. Because of him, humans, even if they are wounded and fall, will eventually rise again under his protection. Therefore, he symbolizes the Dharma protector.

For some reason, Kang Minhee, clad in blue demonic energy, seemed fragile, as if she had sharpened her defenses to protect herself. Like glass. Her entire consciousness realm was red. But from her perspective, all that red was blue, meant to protect herself. I had to pierce through that blue armor and drive Bongryeonghwi into her soul. Could I pierce it? No, should I pierce it?

Under that dilemma, I began to approach Kang Minhee step by step through the storm of demonic energy. Simultaneously, my realm began to rise.

Kiiing—

The blood shadow embedded in Wonryu's body began to harmonize with me, achieving internal and external unity. Celestial Unity! Spring, the will of the immortal stands. The mnemonic of the Celestial Realm quickly flashed through my mind. Simultaneously, my original spirit gradually transformed into a giant demonic king. Along with it, Wonryu's blood body. I felt Seorip's body gradually transforming into a demonic entity, surpassing its realm. My skin became translucent, and blue demonic energy swirled around me. The immense power of the natural world gathered by the Great Desert Dead Sea Formation transformed through my enlightenment.

Early Celestial Realm. Summer, unwavering in the face of destiny. Mid Celestial Realm. Autumn and Winter, following the heart of heaven. Late Celestial Realm!

I absorbed the immense energy of the natural world without losing a single thread. The more I did, the more I transformed into a complete demonic entity, and I could approach Kang Minhee. My size gradually increased, and skulls made of demonic energy rose to form heads, like General Seo. I became a demonic king with eighteen heads and stood before Kang Minhee.

Boom!

Her demonic energy tore through the air, targeting me. I half-closed my eyes, holding Bongryeonghwi, with demonic energy burning in my eyes.

Great Completion of the Celestial Realm. Heaven is round, examining the end of destiny.

With each step I took, her consciousness and mine leaked out. As I observed myself, I could more clearly understand why Kang Minhee had been so troublesome. How long had it been since I faced her so openly? Perhaps we had genuinely dated back then. Maybe it was because we were sincere that it had been awkward all this time. Because we were sincere, we might have treated each other as a joke.

'I can't fully understand why you are suffering.'

But before our awkward relationship, as a bad friend, couldn't I at least offer this much comfort?

With sincerity, I drove Bongryeonghwi into her. I anticipated that her demonic energy would pierce through my body. However, surprisingly, Bongryeonghwi penetrated her blue realm and went inside. Whether it was because her martial arts realm was lacking or because she allowed me, I didn't know. But certainly, it reached.

Crack!

If there was a significant difference in realm, one side had to lower their realm to achieve mental sealing, like Yeonwi and Heonwon. But it wasn't that difficult between the Great Completion of the Celestial Realm and the early stage of the Demonic Realm. At that moment,

Wiiing—

I discovered a faint pink consciousness among the blue ones. And now, with a clear mind, I could hear the whisper of the pink consciousness.

'Ah...'

I had received a gift from those children before. The children I had blessed for their marriage flashed before my eyes, and simultaneously, a majestic voice of a being implanted a mnemonic in my mind.

Ziiing—

It was the mnemonic of the Great Completion of the Celestial Realm. Not just the end of destiny, but a completely different mnemonic.

'Is this what I received in return for blessing them...?'

Then why hadn't I received it until now? Why did I receive it only now, using Seorip's body? I was curious.

Chiiing—

Before I knew it, Bongryeonghwi had entered Kang Minhee and sealed part of her spirit. Before I knew it, we had returned to our human forms from the demonic forms. In the center of the desertified Haneumtaek, we faced each other as the morning dawned.

"...You weren't a shadow."

Kang Minhee looked at me for a moment and then gave a bitter smile.

"Then, you are Seoeunhyun."
