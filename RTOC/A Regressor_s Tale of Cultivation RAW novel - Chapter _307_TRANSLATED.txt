The hum of energy filled the air, jolting my senses awake. How should I describe it? Although I was being pursued by Kang Minhee, I simultaneously saw another 'path.' And I felt as if the knowledge of how to walk this path was flowing directly into my mind. I could understand it. At this very moment, I knew how to traverse this path. What I needed to do to walk it. I could understand it all. This was a path forged by death and death, and a river of blood and life.

'Ziyang Guangmagong, Bihon Jinmagong, Yeomma Bijeon, Shisik Birebon, Anhon Jinkyeol...'

Connecting the peculiar Seongshimjeon to the consciousness of Biryul, I demanded knowledge of demonic arts. While it was impossible to receive complete memories, I could receive rough impressions. The demonic arts Biryul had seen: Bihon Jinmagong, Yeomma Bijeon, Shisik Birebon, Anhon Jinkyeol, and others. The scenes from Biryul's memories where he had merely 'seen' these demonic arts. Integrating these 'scenes' with the foundation of Gwiseon Gyumagyeol, I began to unify the demonic arts.

The integration was swift. All the demonic arts, except for Eunram Magong and Yeomma Bijeon, merged into a unified formula that floated in my mind. Absorption techniques like Bihon Jinmagong and Shisik Birebon. Emission techniques like Ziyang Guangmagong. Ritual techniques like Anhon Jinkyeol. All these techniques, based on Gwiseon Gyumagyeol and influenced by Biryul's memories, were implemented and unified within me.

I could immediately convert all the demonic energy Kang Minhee emitted into power. If I wished, I could diminish my opponent's strength to elevate my own realm. However...

'Is this path the right one?'

Before stepping onto the path, I suddenly questioned whether it was right for me to take this path. I didn't know why.

'No, it's not...'

Upon reflection, it was obvious.

'I still...'

I didn't want to sacrifice others. I didn't want to recklessly take from Kang Minhee. I didn't want to consume the demonic energy of those who had already died. The Dao is something that can only be obtained by becoming stronger and elevating oneself. It is something that can only be achieved by cutting oneself down, striving with the resolve to die by evening after gaining it in the morning. How could something obtained by sacrificing others become my strength? What belongs to others remains theirs. Taking it doesn't make it mine.

'Yes.'

I used the peculiar Seongshimjeon to extend my consciousness. I sent a signal to the living beings within a thousand li radius of Haneumtaek. 

Thud, thud, thud!

The living beings of Haneumtaek, who received my signal, began to flee in panic. In fact, most of the living beings had already fled when Kang Minhee started using her power. The remaining ones were at least at the decision stage, capable of withstanding the aftermath of Kang Minhee's power. They used various techniques to quickly escape beyond a thousand li, and I used the technique I had just created.

'Then, let's not covet what belongs to others.'

I wouldn't take from others. Instead, I would borrow. And the target of my borrowing would be the natural world, not others. The ownerless world.

Rumble!

The land of Haneumtaek within a thousand li radius. The land, where plants grew resiliently even in the cold, began to wither. Due to the demonic art I created, the life force of Haneumtaek started to dry up.

Demonic Art. Great Desert Dead Sea Formation.

Rustle—

In an instant, the land of Haneumtaek within a thousand li radius dried up and turned into a desert. Simultaneously, the life force and energy flowing through Haneumtaek surged within me. A demonic art that didn't sacrifice anyone became my strength.

While I gained power by looking at the 'path,' I realized I hadn't actually entered the 'path.'

'Main body.'

Cooling my head, I conveyed my will to the main body.

'Receive the secret art of the Ghost Realm from Yeonwi. From now on, I will heal Kang Minhee.'

The secret art Yeonwi used to heal Heonwon. Shortly after, the main body received the formula of the secret art from Yeonwi and transmitted it to me.

The technique of Sealing Spirit.

A method of forcibly driving a wedge into the torn spirit of the opponent to seal it.

'Main body, complete the technique of Sealing Spirit and pass it to me. I will challenge the Celestial Human Realm and then receive the technique to heal Kang Minhee.'

After conveying my intention to the main body, I began to convert the energy gathered by the Great Desert Dead Sea Formation into magical power, preparing to reach the Celestial Human Realm.

Ping—

Kang Minhee's line of thought targeted me. I quickly used the Mountain Army Moonlight Step to evade her attack.

'Indeed, her skills have surpassed the first-rate level.'

She had always been like that. Suddenly, I felt a surge of emotion towards Kang Minhee.

* * *

'First-rate...'

Receiving Seorip's sentiment, I scoffed.

'Is it the influence of becoming a Ghost King? Seorip has become too sentimental.'

An overreaction. Kang Minhee was first-rate? Absolutely not.

Clank, clank!

Preparing the technique of Sealing Spirit received from Yeonwi, I recalled past memories. A translucent silver chain formed between my fingers. Like the Five Elements Blood Chain, the technique of Sealing Spirit was a half-spiritual technique. Therefore, I could complete it here and transmit it to Seorip through consciousness. However, I didn't convey my cynicism towards Seorip.

'Seorip, lost in sentiment, is overestimating Kang Minhee.'

Useless emotions were distorting memories. A cold evaluation of Kang Minhee was that she barely reached the second-rate level during her time on Earth. Seorip was merely elevating her evaluation due to uncontrolled emotions.

'I will pass the Sealing Spirit to you, Seorip. Stay calm. Don't you think there's a problem with you right now?'

* * *

'A problem? With me?'

Indeed, my evaluation of Kang Minhee's skills might have been influenced by my memories. But I thought the main body had become excessively cold. It felt as if an ice shard had lodged in my head.

'...Understood. I will be cautious.'

Recognizing the suspicion, I received the Sealing Spirit from the main body. Simultaneously, I evaded Kang Minhee's line of thought and half-closed my eyes.

Tss, tss, tss—

However, I covered the surroundings with my consciousness. There is a difference between the consciousness realm of a martial artist and that of a cultivator. The realm of a cultivator is transparent. It is clear, but it can only sense, not do anything else. However, the realm of a martial artist is full of colors. All colors can be seen. Among them, the red and blue lines are the most developed realms in combat.

The red realm is the area where all the paths the opponent might attack from overlap. The blue realm is the area where all the paths I can attack from overlap. Red and blue. These red and blue realms closely resembled the two colors of thought I knew. The anger and sorrow of the Seven Emotions. Anger is easy to understand. The hostility the opponent sends towards me is most similar to anger. Then, what does the dark blue color of the blue realm, optimized for me, resemble?

'Protection.'

The essence of sorrow is self-protection. Therefore, the thought extending from oneself is expressed as the blue thought optimized for protecting and guarding oneself. For some reason, I suddenly recalled a conversation I had with Taeyeoljeon. While discussing the Seven Fire Kings with her, she explained about the Glass Protection King.

—The Glass Protection King, who wears armor made of lapis lazuli, is the king who protects and guards humans from pain and suffering. Because of him, humans, though they may be wounded and fall, will eventually rise again under his protection. Therefore, he symbolizes protection.

For some reason, Kang Minhee, clad in blue demonic energy, looked fragile, as if she had sharpened her defenses to protect herself. Like glass. Her entire consciousness realm was red. But from her perspective, all that red was blue, meant to protect herself. I had to pierce through that blue armor and drive the Sealing Spirit into her soul. Could I pierce it? No, should I pierce it?

Under that dilemma, I began to approach Kang Minhee step by step through the storm of demonic energy. Simultaneously, my realm began to rise.

Kiiing—

The blood shadow embedded in Wonwoo's body began to harmonize with my influence, achieving internal and external unity. Celestial Human Unity! Spring, the aspiration to become an immortal. The formula of the Celestial Human Realm quickly flashed through my mind. Simultaneously, my original spirit gradually transformed into a giant Ghost King. Along with it, Wonwoo's blood body. I felt Seorip's body transcending its level, gradually becoming a demonic entity. My skin became translucent, and blue demonic energy swirled around me. The immense power of the natural world gathered by the Great Desert Dead Sea Formation transformed through my enlightenment.

Initial stage of the Celestial Human Realm. Summer, unwavering in the face of destiny. Middle stage of the Celestial Human Realm. Autumn and winter, following the heart's will. Late stage of the Celestial Human Realm!

I digested the immense celestial energy within me without losing a single thread. The more I did, the more I transformed into a complete demonic entity, and I could approach Kang Minhee. My size gradually increased, and skulls made of demonic energy rose from various places, forming heads. I became a Ghost King with eighteen heads, standing before Kang Minhee.

Whoosh!

Her demonic energy tore through the air, targeting me. I half-closed my eyes, holding the Sealing Spirit, with demonic energy burning in my eyes. Celestial Human Great Perfection. Heaven's circle, fulfilling destiny. With each step I took, her thoughts and my own thoughts leaked out. Observing myself, I could more clearly understand why Kang Minhee had been so troublesome. How long had it been since I faced her so earnestly? Perhaps we had genuinely dated back then, more than I had thought. Perhaps it was because we were sincere that it had been so awkward all this time. Because we were sincere, we might have treated each other as a joke.

'I can't fully understand why you are suffering.'

But before our awkward relationship, as a bad friend, couldn't I at least offer this much comfort?

With sincerity, I drove the Sealing Spirit into her. Anticipating that her demonic energy would pierce through my body, I struck. But surprisingly, the Sealing Spirit penetrated straight through her blue realm. Whether it was because her martial arts level was insufficient or because she allowed me, I didn't know. But certainly, it reached.

Crack!

If the difference in level was significant, one side would have to lower their level to achieve mental sealing, like Yeonwi and Heonwon. But it wasn't that difficult between the Great Perfection of the Celestial Human Realm and the initial stage of the Demonic Beast Realm. At that moment, I noticed a faint pink thought among the blue thoughts. And, with a clear mind, I could hear the whisper of the pink thought.

'Ah...'

I had received a gift from those children before. The children I had blessed for their marriage flashed before my eyes, and simultaneously, a majestic voice of a being implanted a formula into my mind.

Ziiing—

It was the formula of the Great Perfection of the Celestial Human Realm. Not just fulfilling destiny, but a completely different formula.

'Is this what I received in return for blessing them...?'

Then why hadn't I received it until now? Why did I receive it only now, using Seorip's body? I was deeply curious.

Sss—

Before I knew it, the Sealing Spirit had entered Kang Minhee, sealing part of her spirit. Before I knew it, we had returned to our human forms from the demonic forms. In the center of the desertified Haneumtaek, we faced each other as morning broke.

"...You weren't a shadow."

Kang Minhee looked at me for a moment, then gave a bitter smile.

"Then, you are Seo Eunhyun."
