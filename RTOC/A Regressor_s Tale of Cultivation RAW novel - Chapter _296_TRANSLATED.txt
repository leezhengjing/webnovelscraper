Avenger (4)

‘Strange. It’s definitely strange.’

No matter how many times I looked, the main body was not normal. To describe the disciples of the Jinshen Tianlei Sect as ‘merely’? Why? It felt completely different from the me who used to cry out for the lives of my disciples. However, it wasn’t as if my heart itself had twisted; my feelings towards Kang Minhee and Kim Yeon remained unchanged. I wondered if I had been influenced by Yang Sujin’s theory of inhumanity, but even when I focused my consciousness on the main body and thought of Bukhyanghwa, those feelings were still the same.

‘…Is it really just an overreaction?’

But I couldn’t ignore this sense of incongruity.

‘Well, it can’t be helped. In that case, I have no choice but to quickly raise my cultivation level and rank so that I can observe my consciousness with a higher-level consciousness technique.’

After making that decision, I closed my eyes and continued to train in the Guiseon Gyumagyeol. The main body was with Jeon Myunghun, discussing the combined technique Taesuhui, and was looking for the teleportation array to go to Gwaegun. Meanwhile, I closed my eyes and focused my consciousness on the Guiseon Gyumagyeol, which had turned my original spirit into a ghost king.

Rumble!

Biyul, who was next to my ghost king-transformed original spirit, trembled as he helped me condense the aura of death. The death aura, sticky like mud at the bottom of a river, began to cling to the inside of my original spirit. After a while, a blue ghost fire, similar to pine resin, burned in the eyes of my original spirit. And at some point.

Buzz!

I felt a strange ‘sensation’ as if something was penetrating my upper dantian.

‘This is….’

When I opened my eyes while maintaining the ‘sensation,’ the world around me looked different. The lodging had suddenly turned gray. The more I focused my mind, the more I saw black ‘lines’ among the gray hues.

‘Hmm….’

When I focused my gaze on a porcelain vase in the lodging, the ‘lines’ on the vase gradually increased, forming a shape like ‘cracks.’ As I continued to focus, the ‘cracks’ soon spread out, completely blackening the vase. At that moment, I was startled and turned off the ‘sensation.’

‘What was that just now…?’

It felt as if I had seen something terrifying beyond those black cracks.

“Biyul, explain what senses one gains when becoming a ghost king.”

“The outskirts of the underworld?”

“Ho… I see.”

I remembered the lines spreading in the form of cracks on the vase. Surely, the vase would break in the form of those cracks when it shattered. That was the fate of the vase and the shape of its death.

“The more the shape of death covers an object, the closer it gets to death, and when it’s completely covered, it dies?”

I didn’t need to ask more to understand.

‘When viewed with the ghost sense, when the shape of death completely covers an object, it turns completely black. And beyond that blackness is surely….’

That terrifying feeling.

“I see….”

After pondering for a moment, I closed my eyes and activated the ghost sense. Then, with the enhanced consciousness, I observed my own body. And I couldn’t help but be startled.

Even without focusing my vision with the ghost sense, my body was already completely black!

‘…I see. I am already a dead man.’

At least the original spirit, which had become a ghost king, had a faint gray hue. I completely understood the principle of the Guiseon Gyumagyeol. It was to absorb the ‘shape of death’ present in all beings and turn the original spirit into a ghost king residing in the ‘outskirts of the underworld.’ If the dead practiced it, they would remain in the outskirts of the underworld and not be dragged into the underworld immediately. If the living practiced it, they could enter the outskirts of the underworld.

‘No wonder ghost kings are considered great ghosts and cause panic….’

A being completely covered by the shape of death becomes an entrance to the underworld itself and heads towards the underworld. And the shape of death I felt from myself was enormous and deep. I was like a ‘moving entrance to the underworld.’ I suddenly thought that if ghosts touched me, they might be dragged into the underworld.

‘And this is just a part of my soul attached to the strange body. If it were the main body’s death….’

It would be unimaginably enormous.

‘This is more like… instead of a living person dying and becoming a dead man, it’s as if a dead man crawled up from the underworld.’

No wonder the great ghosts ran away, saying they would be devoured by me.

And I realized one more thing.

‘I see. Biyul is already….’

I had thought Biyul was calmly coming out of my body and conversing with me. But that wasn’t the case. Biyul had already gone mad. The essence of the Suho Seonpa was that the vast majority sought ‘longevity.’ Even if eternal life was impossible, many Suho Seonpa pursued extending their lifespan by reaching a high level. The Black Ghost Bone Valley was no exception. They also wanted longevity, so they wanted to remain in the outskirts of the underworld even as ghost kings. Those who didn’t want to die even as ghost kings were these people.

But looking at me, even I could see that I was surrounded by a terrifying death that made me wonder if I was the reaper of the underworld. Even though it was nothing compared to the main body.

Biyul was already in a state of madness, only responding when I stimulated him.

‘Most ghosts were noisy, but Biyul was so quiet inside me because….’

I felt a bit sorry for him.

‘But according to the rules of the Black Ghost Bone Valley, you have to stay inside a new disciple’s body for a certain period, so please bear with it a little longer.’

After that period, he would come out of my body, lose all his memories, and be peacefully enshrined in the Seomyeongham Shrine again.

I consoled Biyul in my heart and continued to train in the Guiseon Gyumagyeol. The power began to accumulate quickly inside the ghost king-transformed original spirit. As I extracted the shape of death and turned it into power, I soon realized something was changing.

‘This, this is?’

Buzz!

I focused my mind and took out the Five Elements Blood Bead. Although it was a type of consciousness technique, as the name suggested, the Five Elements Blood Bead also had the attributes of the five elements.

Crackle!

The Five Elements Blood Bead quickly fused and melted into my original spirit.

Like the moon’s reflection. Like the sun’s victory. Like the water of the five peaks.

‘Late Original Spirit Stage!’

I went outside the lodging, received guidance, and went out of the Black Ghost Bone Valley to find a secluded place. Soon, heavenly tribulation began to strike, and I endured it, recovering to the late Original Spirit Stage level. Feeling a bit bewildered, I returned to the lodging and observed my body.

‘What is this speed?’

The reason I quickly reached the Original Spirit Stage in the Jinshen Tianlei Sect was thanks to the previous cycle’s cultivation stored in the Colorless Glass Sword. Without the previous cycle’s cultivation, it would have taken me decades to reach the Original Spirit Stage, including the time to gather qi. But now, the Colorless Glass Sword was with the main body, and I had no previous cycle’s cultivation stored. Yet, I could accumulate enough power to reach the late Original Spirit Stage so quickly.

I felt incredulous at this insane cultivation speed and continued to train in the Guiseon Gyumagyeol in the lodging.

The next day arrived.

Geupun and Wihon, the two elders of the Celestial Human Stage, looked at me with interest.

“You must have been hiding your cultivation yesterday. To think you’re already at the peak of the Original Spirit Stage.”

“A quite high-level disciple has entered the Black Ghost Bone Valley. Haha! Judging by your aura, you might soon become an elder.”

“Let me greet you in advance. I look forward to working with you, Elder Seo. Haha!”

“Haha… No, seniors.”

I laughed awkwardly.

‘…Even if I said I reached the peak of the Original Spirit Stage overnight… they wouldn’t believe it?’

I could even advance to the Celestial Human Stage if I gathered a bit more qi. I laughed awkwardly and, from that day, followed the tasks of the Black Ghost Bone Valley, enhancing, supplementing, and amplifying the curses they created.

‘I understand why the Black Ghost Bone Valley also researched curses.’

When I viewed the curse script with the ghost sense, it was infinitely transparent, the exact opposite of the shape of death.

‘Gray represents the outskirts of the underworld, black represents the underworld itself, and the transparent light that belongs nowhere represents the present world?’

I recalled Biyul’s words and looked at the curse script. A curse was pain. Pain belonged to the realm of ‘life,’ so it couldn’t be recognized in the outskirts of the underworld. Similarly, blessings also appeared transparent. Although blessings and curses seemed opposite, from the perspective of death, they were the same.

‘For ghost kings who are about to be dragged into the underworld, curse techniques are quite necessary.’

Since curse techniques belonged to the realm of life, they were like wedges that could hold them back from being dragged into the underworld. Of course, ghost kings were already dead, so they were destined to be dragged into the underworld eventually. When the pull of the underworld grew stronger after death, no matter how many curse techniques or life-related consciousness techniques they learned, they would inevitably be sucked into the underworld.

‘By the way, this curse….’

Hiss—

I clicked my tongue as I looked at the curse script we created together with nine other curse practitioners. It was a rather vicious curse script. As I traced the essence of the curse script, I realized that the essence of this curse was someone’s deep resentment.

‘I don’t know exactly whose it is… but it’s a curse based on strong resentment.’

Anyone affected by this curse would be in great trouble. If they were below the Celestial Human Stage, they would not just weaken but rot away upon contact with the curse. Even the curse practitioners found it difficult to handle the curse, and the control gradually fell to me, the most skilled among them. I infused my Yin Soul Ghost Curse into the curse script to tame it so it wouldn’t run wild without my permission.

“Oh, you’ve already stabilized it?”

The boy who gave us the task, a boy named Hyun Gui, laughed heartily as he saw us perfectly controlling the curse script.

“I didn’t expect such good results even with highly skilled curse practitioners… Truly impressive. Especially you, Master Seo….”

He looked at me, who skillfully handled the curse, and let out a small exclamation. For some reason, I felt it would be good to be in Hyun Gui’s good graces, so I manipulated the curse script even more brilliantly in front of him.

The work of enhancing and amplifying the curse script took several days. After enhancing the curse script to a certain extent, we were given rest periods. It felt like we could rest for a day or two after enhancing the curse script for about ten days. And one out of the ten of us could go out for external activities periodically. Of course, only one person could go out at a time, and we were under a prohibition to keep the curse creation in the Black Ghost Bone Valley a secret, but it wasn’t a problem.

And soon, the time for me to go out arrived.

“Master Seo, if you go out, it will be difficult to stabilize the curse, so please return quickly.”

Hyun Gui laughed as he saw me off at the main gate of the Black Ghost Bone Valley.

“Understood. I’m just going to check something briefly in the Black Ghost Bone Valley, so don’t worry.”

“Got it.”

“Then, I’ll be off….”

As I was about to borrow the teleportation array to head to the Black Ghost Bone Valley after bidding farewell to Hyun Gui.

“Wait, Master Seo. I have something to tell you.”

“Yes? What is it?”

Hyun Gui smiled and spoke in a low voice.

“There’s something I want to tell you alone. I was impressed by your curse skills and have a request.”

Step, step….

He crossed the main gate of the Black Ghost Bone Valley and snapped his fingers.

Snap!

Hiss!

Then, Yin energy emanated from his body, coloring the surroundings. I realized that a special barrier was blocking the inside and outside.

“What is it that you want to say so secretly?”

“…There are many things to be cautious about. The Black Dragon King has cast a spell over the entire Black Ghost Bone Valley, always watching us. To see if we are trying to escape his grasp.”

“…!”

“This fact is also confidential, so I can’t tell you openly. I can only speak freely after coming out of the Black Ghost Bone Valley and setting up a barrier.”

Hyun Gui continued with a bitter expression.

“…Our Black Ghost Bone Valley is said to be backed by the Black Dragon King. People think that since the sect is led by his descendants, he will treat us well. But that’s not the case. Every year, we have to offer sacrifices of at least the Decisive Stage to the Black Dragon King.”

“…!”

“If the number of sacrifices is insufficient, the Black Dragon King will devour one of our disciples. We are not his favored ones but his sacrifices and slaves. Therefore, a faction within the Black Ghost Bone Valley thought of this.”

His eyes shone brightly.

“Even if we are demoted from the Five Great Sects of the human race, let’s escape from the grasp of Hyun Eum. We, the entire sect, are under a prohibition and cannot escape, but… there is a possibility.”

I swallowed as I listened to Hyun Gui’s words.

‘If he’s revealing such a deep secret… he’ll kill me if I don’t cooperate.’

Of course, I wasn’t particularly afraid of Hyun Gui in front of me. Although he was a practitioner of the Heaven and Earth Dual Cultivation, I was confident I could defeat him. But the fact that he was talking about this outside the main gate of the Black Ghost Bone Valley meant that his comrades from the Black Ghost Bone Valley were hiding nearby.

Although Seo Rip was just an avatar and it wouldn’t matter if he died, it would be a bit of a waste since he was an avatar infiltrating the Black Ghost Bone Valley.

“What possibility?”

I decided to listen to his thoughts for now.

“In 500 years, the Treasure Map of the True Dragon Immortal will appear in the Chaos Realm.”

“The True Dragon Immortal!!!”

I was startled and asked again.

“Is that true?”

“Yes. Those who know already know. It appears periodically every 2,000 years.”

I let out a sigh of admiration. The title of Immortal (眞人) could only be used by those in the Opening Stage. And I was very familiar with the title of True Dragon (嶒龍). A legend I learned while staying in the Ji Clan. Long ago, during the War of the Guanghan Realm, the ancestor of the True Dragon Alliance, who led the Guanghan Realm to victory. The land where the current True Dragon Alliance is located. The ancestor of the Dragon Clan, who is the very territory of the True Dragon Alliance, was the True Dragon Immortal.

“Are you saying the relics left by the ancestor of the Ji Clan will appear?”

“Yes. The Treasure Map left by him is a treasure map itself and a different world. And we found an artifact inside that Treasure Map that can free us from Hyun Eum. It’s an artifact that can lift the prohibition placed on us by the Black Dragon King. However, lifting the prohibition requires a skilled curse practitioner.”

“So you want to recruit me?”

“Yes. If you help us, we will give you one of the artifacts obtained from the different world and ten times the reward we promised for this mission.”

“Hoo….”

The reward for this mission was already substantial. But ten times that reward? It was quite tempting.

“There is a special prohibition in the different world, so practitioners of the Combined Stage cannot enter, so it’s not very dangerous. You just need to use your curse skills.”

“Hmm….”

I pondered and then asked him.

“You said one of the artifacts obtained from the different world. What kind of artifacts are there?”

“I’ll show you the list right away.”

Snap!

When Hyun Gui snapped his fingers, countless illusions of items appeared before my eyes. As I grabbed one of the nearby illusions, I felt information about the illusion flow into my mind.

‘Ho… each one is amazing.’

I clicked my tongue. But having been betrayed by Seo Hyul so many times, I was suspicious.

‘Such good conditions?’

Was there some trick?

‘The intention is also suspicious.’

Hyun Gui hadn’t told me everything yet. But it didn’t seem like a big deal, just a bit of a nagging feeling. At that moment.

‘Hmm?’

I saw a book among the illusions Hyun Gui had brought out. The book, bound in the skin of a strange beast, had a title written in a language I had never seen before. Then, Biyul, who was inside me, spoke.

‘Hmm? Is there something special?’

‘No, of course, I knew. But why do you insist on getting that?’

‘Explain what it is.’

Following Biyul’s words, I almost jumped in surprise.

‘…!’

The main body also reacted enthusiastically, and without hesitation, I chose the book titled ‘Budeok Jesaseo.’

“Hmm, this book? Well, it’s a book we can’t even interpret, so if you like it, you can take it.”

Hyun Gui nodded.

“It’s of no value to us, so I’ll give it to you as an advance payment right now.”

Buzz!

Hyun Gui seemed to be communicating with someone outside, then split the space and reached in to retrieve the book from somewhere. And I received the ‘Budeok Jesaseo’ on the spot.

* * *

‘Good. If I get the Budeok Jesaseo, I can build the axis of wealth….’

I had once sighed, thinking I would have to travel through the Middle Realms to obtain the true axis of wealth. But fortunately, it seemed I only needed to visit three places.

‘I don’t need to go to the Golden Realm.’

Jinma, Goryeok, and Myeonggwi. It seemed I only needed to visit these three places later.

“You seem to be in a good mood, Seo Eunhyun.”

Jeon Myunghun smirked and asked.

“Is it because you’re going to meet Kim Yeon?”

“Well, that’s part of it.”

“It’s strange. No matter how much I tried to get your attention at the company, you were strangely insensitive, but you noticed it here?”

“….”

It seemed even Jeon Myunghun knew that Yeon had shown interest in me.

“I thought you were pretending not to notice. So
