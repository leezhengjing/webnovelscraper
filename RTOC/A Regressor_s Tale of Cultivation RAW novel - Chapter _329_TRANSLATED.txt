The light dimmed. Boom! A massive mountain plummeted to the ground. No, it was a giant with a mountain growing from its body. Thud! Simultaneously, a middle-aged man with salt pillars sprouting from his body also fell to the ground. For a while, both were preoccupied with removing the bizarre foreign substances from their bodies. Rustle, rustle!

"Ugh!" The middle-aged man, Hunwon, tore off the salt growing on his body and began to regenerate. At the same time, the giant, Seo Eunhyun, also tore off the mountain ranges sprouting from his body. Hunwon was the first to recover. After removing all the salt chunks, he fully regenerated and glared at Seo Eunhyun.

"You are someone who should not be left alive."

Whirrr— Energy swirled around Hunwon's arms once more. Seo Eunhyun growled, his 38 eyes glowing.

"Sorry, but I don't remember you."

Hunwon smirked and prepared the Taesan Yeolje Gong with both arms again. Seo Eunhyun, with a desperate look, tried to shake off the mountains growing on his body and gather energy in his hands once more. However, his expression was filled with frustration. Proficiency! The reason Hunwon could continuously use the Taesan Yeolje Gong was that he had been mastering it for tens of thousands of years. No matter how skilled Seo Eunhyun was, it was impossible for him to freely use a technique he had just learned.

In fact, the only reason he could use the Taesan Yeolje Gong after seeing the incantation once was because he was a user of the Heaven and Earth Twin Hands, was well-versed in Yin and Yang, had mastered all five elemental attributes, and met all the conditions to use the Taesan Yeolje Gong through the Yin Soul Ghost Spell and the White Orchid Blessing Spell. Normally, just seeing the incantation would never allow one to use the Taesan Yeolje Gong.

Boom! Hunwon gathered his energy. To make matters worse, Seo Eunhyun was currently struggling to move due to the backlash from using the Taesan Yeolje Gong and seeing the 'name'! It was a critical moment. At that moment, Won Yoo, who was beside Jeon Myunghun, moved. Swish— In Won Yoo's hand was the Chongcheon Sword.

* * *

Slash! Once. Once was enough. To divert Hunwon's attention, who was concentrating hard on preparing the Taesan Yeolje Gong, once was enough. Slash! A multicolored wound appeared on Hunwon's body, struck by the Chongcheon Sword. He hurriedly turned to look at me, and I smiled and said,

"It seems I know quite a few miscellaneous techniques."

When I grabbed Won Yoo's shoulder earlier to send him to Jeon Myunghun, I left a mental clone inside him. Just in case! Buzz— I emerged from Won Yoo's body and stood before Hunwon. Thud, thud, thud, thud! There were a total of 24 mental clones inside Won Yoo's body. I had just used one to warn Hunwon.

"Keep your promise, Lord of Bongrae Palace. I hope you will let us go now. Surely, you are not someone who goes back on their word."

Hunwon glared at me with burning eyes and spat out his words.

"I may have learned the techniques of the Heart Tribe, but I am still a human. I may be a cunning Heart Tribe member, but I am not a spy. Moreover, I am a fourth-stage Heart Tribe member, so the Taesu Association will recognize my strength!"

Whirrr— Hunwon sneered at me as if he couldn't believe it and gathered black and white energy in his hands.

"Why wouldn't they recognize you? But I repeat, keep your promise!"

I clicked my tongue as I looked at him.

"Words won't work, huh."

Buzz! 22 of the 23 mental clones merged into one. One technique per clone.

"I have warned you multiple times."

Flash! The jade of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements surrounded me. Then, Hunwon shouted. I grasped my technique and countered his with my ultimate move.

"Danak (断岳)!"

Although it wasn't necessary to shout the name of a martial art technique, in this case, I did it to break Hunwon's will to kill us. Hunwon's strike burst from his hands, and my 22 sword techniques combined, tearing through the heavens and earth with a flash of light. Take this. Each strike was as powerful as a combined attack of the Taesu's full strength. The strikes were maximized in power by being combined into a single sword technique!

I could see Hunwon's entire body, his soul, and his domain being torn apart by the slashes. Of course, my entire body was also disintegrating as a result. I would probably be scattered and disappear into seven types of energy.

'But this is just a clone, so...'

It doesn't matter. Hunwon should blame himself for foolishly using his ultimate move on a clone.

'He may talk about Heart Tribe spies, but it seems he has little experience fighting them...'

* * *

All the mental clones I had infused into Won Yoo through his shoulder were destroyed. And I saw Hunwon, who had been hit by the clone's ultimate move, in front of me.

Sizzle— My body returned to its human form. It seemed that maintaining the giant form with the incomplete Three-Talents was too much for my body.

"Ugh, cough, cough, cough!"

"It seems you have little experience fighting the Heart Tribe. Even if your fellow Taesu is one of them, didn't you even ask her?"

"Cough, cough, cough... What are you talking about...?"

"Well, never mind. Do you want to continue?"

Whirrr— I gathered energy in my hands and asked.

"I have recovered my energy. I can use the Taesan Yeolje Gong again. And if you want, I can use the slashes you just saw as much as you like."

Of course, it was a bluff. Even with the body of a Sa-Chuk-Gi, it was hard to continuously use a technique that involved 22 consecutive strikes. Although I could use it to some extent, it wouldn't have the same power as before. The biggest problem was... Cheonra (天羅). As soon as I recognized that 'name,' I was engulfed in immense fear.

'It's him...! That being...!'

One of the ten seats I saw during my regression. It was definitely him! That was definitely his true name.

'But it's strange...'

Both Hunwon and I must have recognized something terrifying, yet neither of us seemed greatly shocked.

'Why?'

Hunwon also seemed to have seen 'it,' as evidenced by the salt pillars, but he recovered too easily. 'Moreover, Cheonra is definitely an active Eosun.' Yet, despite knowing the true name, how could he be so fine? When I learned the names of the deceased true immortals like Yoo Hodeok and Haenyeong, I was greatly affected. 'Moreover... Cheonra's name was casually mentioned by Yeonwi...'

As I thought about it, I became more confused. 'Was it not the owner of the seat I saw during my regression? Is it just a name that exudes a similar aura...?' Anyway, the important thing was that I couldn't drag this out any longer. If I did, I didn't know what kind of being might take notice.

"Do you want to continue, Lord of Bongrae Palace?"

Flash! Light burst from my arms, and salt began to sprout. Hunwon flinched at the sight and gritted his teeth before speaking.

"...Fine. I will keep my promise. Go."

"Good decision."

I nodded and immediately started moving with Jeon Myunghun and Hongbeom.

* * *

Hunwon groaned as he healed his body, which had been torn apart by the energy of the Heaven and Earth Middle Realm.

"Ugh... Damn it... If it weren't for the seizure of the Eye of Insight..."

He groaned, clutching his eyes. The character '監' glowing in his eyes was burning even brighter.

* * *

Cheonwang Cheonyeok. Inside the palace of light, where all kinds of colored light gathered. Eight shadows gathered beneath the seat of light. The eight enormous beings communicated with each other in metaphysical language. Each time they exchanged words, the light of the entire Cheonyeok trembled. At that moment, a true immortal in the form of a Peng bird flew in front of the palace where they resided. Although the Peng bird was originally large enough to cover a continent with one wing, it was no bigger than a small sparrow before the shadows. The eight shadows seemed to communicate in metaphysical language for a moment, then spoke to the true immortal in the language of the lower world to prevent him from going mad.

The true immortal tried not to look directly at the eight shadows and spoke. A commotion arose among the eight shadows. The entire Cheonwang Cheonyeok shook. One of the shadows spoke to the true immortal in a way that prevented him from going mad. The true immortal was startled by the shadows' words, which were essentially telling him to go and die. However, he gritted his beak and nodded. The Peng bird left the palace of light again. How much time passed? The Peng bird did not return. The shadows communicated in metaphysical language. Their meaning was roughly this:

The eight shadows looked up at the seat of light above them. After a while, the eight shadows disappeared from the hall. Only the seat of light remained, emitting an even brighter light.

* * *

Twitch! I suddenly looked up at the sky. For some reason, I felt a chill, but the sunlight seemed to brighten, and the ominous feeling that had brushed past me disappeared.

'What was that?'

It passed so quickly that I didn't want to dwell on it, but I decided to stay alert. Hunwon could suddenly chase after us, a monster could emerge from the ground, or Seo Hyul could...

"Hehe, hello, Seo Dowoo."

"Ah, yes. I was actually about to call you."

I said as I looked at Seo Hyul, who had approached me with a creepy smile.

"Hehe, you noticed my stealth technique. Impressive. And to think you've reached the Sa-Chuk-Gi level..."

"Hongbeom, Jeon Myunghun. Cover your ears for a moment."

The two obediently covered their ears at my words. I looked at Seo Hyul, who had appeared before me with a creepy smile. In my past life, I had to call him to make him appear, but this time, he spoke to me first without me calling him. The reason was obvious.

"Are you surprised that the Takhon Mancheon inside me is gone, Seo Hyul?"

Freeze! Seo Hyul's body stiffened.

"If you want, I'll give you a chance. Try again. You can sacrifice a few personalities."

I spread my arms and said nonchalantly. Seo Hyul's eyes turned reptilian.

"...Hehe..."

If he tried to parasitize me again, I could annihilate him with the karmic fire burning inside me. If he didn't, I could manipulate him as I pleased.

'You've had fun using others until now, haven't you, Seo Hyul?'

Now it's my turn.
