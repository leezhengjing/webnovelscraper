### Return to Cultivation (회귀수선전) Chapter 385: Salt (1)

Liu Yao's mouth opened. "This world is a real world. It is not simply within an illusionary formation."

"...A real world? But... the inhabitants here have no consciousness."

"Well... honestly, I don't know how the sect leader judges it. However, from my perspective, the high-power realm that Father took us to seemed like a fantasy world. When Father took my siblings and me to the high-power realm, Mother advised us to always remember ourselves, saying it was a 'world of dreams.'"

"What...?"

"From my perspective, that world was indeed a dream and a lie. The sect leader knows how I behaved in the high-power realm... That world was a false world, a world of 'non-humans'..."

"No, wait... don't use words like 'non-humans.' It's very unpleasant."

"Ah... I'm sorry. Anyway, even though my memories were sealed, I unconsciously regarded it as such and lived recklessly."

I felt a headache coming on. It was as if I had suddenly heard a bizarre truth. 'Our world is a dream?'

"...But that's a strange thing to say. If our world is a dream... then what are 'we' in this world? Are you saying that some of our memories create certain fairy tales and legends in this world, and corresponding characters appear?"

"Corresponding characters... From my perspective, it's the opposite. The people who were living normally suddenly have strange dreams one day and their personalities change. Sometimes even royalty experiences such things."

"...Then why did you follow Liu Lin if you knew the high-power realm was a world of dreams? And who is the current king of Fenglai Kingdom?"

"First of all... Father said that if we went to the world of dreams, we could enjoy immense pleasure and delight, and live for hundreds or thousands of years. And he said we could return whenever we wanted. He said it was like a place of immortals or a paradise, so we followed him to enjoy it for a while. At that time, Father was still in his dragon form, so we thought he was leading us to a divine place."

"......"

A look of misery spread across Liu Yao's face. "But as soon as we arrived in the world of dreams, the high-power realm, Father sealed our memories and extracted the true blood of the sea dragon from my siblings who inherited his bloodline. Just as I regarded that world as a dream, he also regarded this world as a dream, and he seemed to have no guilt because he thought we, born from that dream, were also just illusions."

I listened in silence to her shocking words. "Fortunately or unfortunately, I was the youngest and had almost no sea dragon blood, so Father treated me as a discard and did not extract my sea dragon blood. Anyway... Father roughly appointed me as a princess and let me go, and I tried everything to escape from his terrifying grasp. I eventually stole the secret technique of the True Demon Flame and managed to escape. After that, I lived recklessly, indulging in pleasure and deceit in the world of dreams."

"...Why did you steal the secret technique of the True Demon Flame?"

"At that time, I just thought it looked 'tempting.' But unconsciously, I think I did it 'to return to this world.'"

"To return to this world?"

"Yes. Even though my sea dragon blood is of a low grade, it still exists, and the sea dragon tribe is the only race in the high-power realm that can read the sea paths. I think I intended to transform into a dragon and find Fenglai Island to return. Of course, I didn't know what I wanted because I had no memories..."

I was left speechless by the shocking truths. Seoran, who had been listening beside me, also had her mouth wide open.

"First, let me tell you the conditions for regaining your senses in this world."

"Yes, quickly tell us."

I examined Liu Yao's consciousness. 'She's not lying.' Not only her consciousness but also her heartbeat and other reactions indicated she was telling the truth. 'And considering the situation, there's no reason for her to come all the way here to lie to us.'

"The quickest way to regain your senses in this world is to have someone who cherishes you."

"Someone who cherishes you...?"

"Yes. The more people who think of you in the high-power realm or other worlds, the deeper their feelings, and the higher their status, the quicker you will regain your senses. In other words, the time it takes to regain your senses in this world is determined by the 'connections' you've built."

"......"

"......"

Seoran and I looked at each other. I had many things to consider. Starting with the followers of the Wujigyo sect, Kang Minhee of the Guanghan realm, the disciples of the Golden Thunder Sect in the Water realm, and even the True Men of the Gaeulgi sect... And those who showed great interest in me during this regression, the [Beings Who Can Only Bring Misfortune]...

So, what about Seoran? Seoran, looking confused, spoke up. "...Does Master think of me so deeply in the underworld...?"

"Not necessarily... There are still disciples with masters outside who haven't fully regained their senses yet..."

"Then what is it...?"

Liu Yao shrugged indifferently. "Perhaps Lady Seoran is receiving the love of a high-ranking being?"

"Who could love me like that...?"

"Is there no one who comes to mind? Parents, acquaintances, friends, or ancestors...?"

"My parents are not ordinary... but not that high-ranking... All my acquaintances and friends came here with me... Ancestors... Hmm, I don't really want to think about my grandfather, the Sea Dragon King."

He clutched his head as if he couldn't figure it out. Liu Yao shrugged again. "Maybe you're unknowingly receiving the love of a high-ranking being. Congratulations."

Seoran's face turned pale. "Is that... a good thing...?"

Seoran was confused, and I fell into deep thought. 'It's strange.' Liu Yao was telling the truth, but it was too bizarre. There were too many oddities in this world for it to be real, and it was different from Shangli. Moreover, although Liu Yao didn't seem to know, this world was always tailored to us. It was confusing whether Liu Lin had lied to me or Liu Yao was mistaken. A world with strange contradictions and oddities. That was Fenglai Island. 'And what about Seoran?'

According to Liu Yao, the conditions for regaining one's senses in this world were threefold. There should be many beings who cherish the entrant. The feelings of those who cherish the entrant should be deep. The status of those who cherish the entrant should be high.

'Could Seoran also be under the gaze of some true immortal?' I looked at Seoran with suspicious eyes. It was possible. Even at the beginning of this life, hadn't she been entangled with a high-ranking being from the underworld and fallen into the ghost realm? Seoran might also be attracting the attention of the underworld's reapers by practicing ghostly techniques.

I pressed my complicated thoughts and pondered. 'Then the ones who will regain their memories the fastest would be the executives of the Wujigyo sect, especially Yeonwi and Jeon Myunghun.' Yeonwi and Jeon Myunghun were not only famous in the Wujigyo sect but also in the lower realm's Golden Thunder Sect, so they would regain their senses the fastest. Since Liu Yao was originally from this world, she would have regained her senses almost simultaneously with Seoran and me.

I organized my complicated thoughts and asked, "Then what is Liu Lin's goal, and what is his ultimate purpose? He seems to have some connection with the True Demon Flame, but what is it? Why did the True Demon Flame want you?"

"First, regarding the True Demon Flame, it wanted my 'status' along with the dragon transformation technique I stole. Not as the Princess of the True Dragon Palace, but as the Princess of Fenglai Kingdom. By marrying me, the True Demon Flame could quickly gain benefits in Fenglai Kingdom and become its king or national teacher. That's why the True Demon Flame wanted me and joined hands with my father."

"...Wait." I noticed something strange in Liu Yao's words and glared at her. "If this world is your homeland, why are you letting us lead the yokai to overthrow Fenglai Kingdom?"

"Well... the sect leader won't rule Fenglai Kingdom forever, right? And I know the sect leader's character well. Although he made a name for himself as the Yokai King, he didn't cause any human casualties, even if he did some plundering. When the sect leader returns to the original world, we can use the power of the guardian dragons protecting the royal family to disperse the yokai and restore the royal family."

"......"

"...Um... Are you going to kill my mother, the current queen?"

"...I won't kill her."

"Thank you!"

Liu Yao smiled brightly as if she had expected that and bowed. I felt a headache coming on. I had heard too many shocking truths. But surprisingly, there were still things I needed to hear.

"...What is Liu Lin's goal?"

At the mention of Liu Lin, Liu Yao's complexion darkened. "...Father... was not born with much sea dragon blood. But after great effort, he succeeded in transforming into a dragon. However... it seems he was not satisfied with that."

The truth about Liu Lin came out of Liu Yao's mouth. "Among my father's relatives, there is a person named Liu Wung, the master of the Sea Dragon Palace, who originally ruled the sea area where Fenglai Island was located."

"Yes, I know roughly."

"That Liu Wung... unlike my father, was born with an almost perfect sea dragon body and blood. My father always envied him. But for some reason, Liu Wung contracted a disease that caused his blood to boil and died without overcoming it. His blood evaporated completely, leaving only his sea dragon body, and he died like a wooden statue."

From her continued words, I could guess Liu Lin's plan. "Don't tell me... he did that dirty deed?"

"Probably. Father decided to take Liu Wung's body. And to gather the lacking sea dragon blood, he came to this world, gave birth to us, and extracted the sea dragon blood to infuse it into Liu Wung's body. He then uprooted the Sea Dragon Palace, which Liu Wung ruled, and made it into an underwater island beneath the True Dragon Palace, hiding Liu Wung's body there."

"......"

"And with a very peculiar technique, he split his soul and hid it in Liu Wung's body on the underwater island."

Crack... Only then did I realize why Liu Lin had cooperated so obediently when we captured him. "It wasn't his main body...!"

The main body was hidden in the underwater island beneath the True Dragon Palace!

"...But that's strange." Seoran expressed her doubt. "Both Kim Younghoon and the sect leader have the ability to see the essence of souls. How could they not distinguish between the main body and a split soul...?"

"There is one technique that can make it impossible to distinguish between the main body and a split soul."

At my cold voice, Seoran's eyes widened. "And the sea dragon who mastered that technique, as far as we know, is one... or not just one? Anyway, there is one."

"...No way."

"Yes." I recalled the face of a person I loathed. A 'huff huff' sound echoed in my ears, and my shoulders felt stiff. "Seo Hyul. And the Soul Splitting Technique."
