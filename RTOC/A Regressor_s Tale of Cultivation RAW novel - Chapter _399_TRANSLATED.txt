**Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 399: With the Wind (2)**

*Shuaaa!*

As I pierced through the barrier formed by dense demonic energy, the surroundings brightened. For a moment, I was left speechless by the overwhelming sight before me.

Golden stones! Golden stones were shining everywhere!

‘This is insane… Did they grind down several islands to create a field of golden stones?’

It was truly a treasure trove! Not only were there golden stones scattered everywhere, but also the rare Inspection Jade and even a couple of Flame Crystals. Besides the golden stones, there were also treasures made of coral, or precious gems like Tridacna, Red Pearls, Lapis Lazuli, and Agate, all known as the Seven Treasures, exuding spiritual energy.

But the most astonishing sight was the pure white palace in the middle of the mountain of treasures. It was the Flame Crystal Palace that Yukrin had brought from Penglai Island. Even I was taken aback by the sheer amount of treasures, and Jin Mayeol was so overwhelmed that he couldn't control his breathing, exhaling and inhaling repeatedly.

Taking advantage of the moment, I quickly dashed towards the Flame Crystal Palace. And then it happened.

*Flash!*

A white sword aura, scattering a chilling sword light, flew at me from behind. I hurriedly turned around and blocked Jin Mayeol's sword light.

‘This is…!’

My arm went numb. This was definitely not a sword light that someone like Jin Mayeol could produce. When I looked back at him, Jin Mayeol was already pointing a white sword at me, which he had pulled out from the pile of treasures.

‘What the hell is that…?’

It was a sword made of pure white Flame Crystal. The space around the sword was subtly trembling, and the characters "Gairyeok" (改曆) engraved on the sword were faintly glowing, exuding an aura of dominance.

“Do you know the myth of the ‘Heavenly Artisan,’ the god of craftsmen? It is said that the artisan, who created countless divine treasures, made a treasure to contain the power of the god of the calendar. A long time ago, a certain quasi-immortal witnessed the shadow of that treasure and was so moved that he tried to create a replica using Flame Crystal, but… he failed, leaving only three failed attempts.”

“…So what?”

“This is a replica of the divine treasure, Gairyeok!!!”

*Boom!*

Once again, Jin Mayeol swung Gairyeok, and a sword light comparable to Kim Younghoon's sword light was generated from his hand.

*Boom!*

I swung my Total Heaven Sword to shatter the sword light and frowned.

‘I was pushed back…!’

After deflecting the sword light, my feet were pushed back by an inch. This was something that should have been impossible given Jin Mayeol's original skill level.

*Boom!*

I also looked around, trying to find a useful magical tool, but there were no weapon-shaped tools in sight. And soon, I realized why.

*Clang, clang, clang!*

Dozens of swords, sabers, spears, and divine weapons were embedded around Jin Mayeol.

‘That bastard….’

That pirate bastard had quickly deployed his domain to gather the treasures as soon as he entered.

‘So his domain is specialized in theft, not stealth.’

I confirmed that his greed and his domain were closely connected.

“I see. Your domain…”

“Did you figure it out?”

“…It’s disgustingly filthy.”

I let out a hollow laugh, realizing how quickly he had swept up the surrounding treasures without me noticing. His domain's ability was not just simple stealth but ‘enhancing his theft ability in proportion to his greed.’

“This is truly thrilling. I've never seen a place with so many treasures in my life! Hahaha! Who would have thought that Yukrin, that pig, had stashed away so many treasures! Although technically, it’s the legacy of the Sea Dragon King Yukwoong… Hehe, are these the treasures of the Sea Dragon King that can find a path in the deep sea! Hahaha!”

Jin Mayeol's eyes gleamed.

“Come at me, Demon Sect Leader! In this place, my greed is at its peak! Here, I am the strongest!”

He charged at me, surrounded by dozens, even hundreds of divine weapons, just like Kim Younghoon before.

*Boom!*

His Gairyeok clashed with my Total Heaven Sword. I felt my entire body tremble from the overwhelming power of Gairyeok. Although his cultivation level was low, he was compensating for it with the power of the divine sword and his initial fusion stage strength.

And to make matters worse, the surroundings began to shake.

‘This is…!’

*Rumble!*

The mountain of treasures started to shake. At the same time, light began to emanate from the Flame Crystal Palace at the top of the mountain.

*Flash!*

A dreamy power seemed to envelop the surroundings. Simultaneously, Jin Mayeol and I narrowed our eyes.

‘The energy has thinned? No… this is…!’

An illusion! The Flame Crystal Palace was emitting a faint illusion, transforming the area into a world where the mysteries of Penglai Island could not be used. Although its power was weak compared to when it was on Salt Mountain, Jin Mayeol and I felt our strength rapidly diminish. My body, being a clone, became translucent and was on the verge of disappearing.

‘This crazy…!’

I cursed inwardly and retreated. And then, suddenly, the mountain of treasures shook again, and a giant dragon emerged from within.

‘A shed skin!?’

It was the shed skin of Yukrin. The shed skin, containing a faint consciousness of Yukrin, roared at us intruders and wriggled its body, trying to devour us. Although the shed skin itself didn't seem to have much power, it was absurdly unaffected by the illusion and seemed to use its energy freely.

*Splash!*

As the shed skin wriggled, the mountain of treasures swayed like seawater.

“Good, this is getting more interesting!”

*Clang!*

My Total Heaven Sword clashed with his Gairyeok sword. Due to the illusion from the palace, my energy had weakened, and I almost felt my entire body disintegrate from the impact.

*Rumble!*

‘This… useless illusion formation.’

My energy was reduced to the brink of extinction, but Jin Mayeol, being in the initial fusion stage, had his energy at the condensation stage level. We dodged the attacks of Yukrin's shed skin while clashing swords.

*Clang, clang!*

Due to the lack of energy to freely transform the Total Heaven Sword, I fixed it in the form of a sword and clashed with him. Pretending to attack with a horizontal slash, I immediately tripped his legs to disrupt his lower body and stabbed his eyes seven times in a row.

*Puk!*

Jin Mayeol's head split open, but his body, at the condensation stage, kept regenerating and attacking me as long as his head wasn't cut off.

*Boom!*

When he swung Gairyeok, a corner of the treasure mountain, which was like a small mountain, collapsed. A wave of golden stones engulfed us, and we dueled on the sea of swaying golden stones. I spun in a lower stance, slashing upwards like a dance, splitting Jin Mayeol's chin. He stepped forward, trying to slash from the upper left to the lower right. I tripped his foot to break his balance and slashed his side with the Moon Peak technique. He tried to regain his balance and struck three consecutive times with Gairyeok. I countered the first with the Empty Valley technique, neutralized the second, and deflected the third with the Deep Mountain technique, then closed in with the Hidden Valley technique and slashed his chest with the Craggy Rock technique.

“Grrr! Ah! Good, good, good!”

With an excited expression, he regenerated his body, holding Gairyeok in his right hand and an unknown divine spear in his left, while floating numerous divine weapons like demon sabers and ghost palaces in the air, attacking me.

*Rumble!*

A barrage of attacks, like beams of light, rained down on me. But they were shallow. They lacked proper coordination. I deflected, deflected, or dodged the attacks with the Mountain and Water technique, as if dancing.

*Splash!*

The terrain changed again due to the movement of Yukrin's shed skin. I found myself positioned above Jin Mayeol.

*Boom!*

Concentrating my slashes in one spot, I bit into one of Jin Mayeol's weapons like a tiger in the mountains.

*Crash!*

The concentrated sword energy shattered Jin Mayeol's ghost palace, which had also weakened along with us.

*Splash!*

The terrain changed again. Jin Mayeol, being a pirate accustomed to fighting at sea, quickly regained his stance and struck down at me. I used the Eight Seas technique, spinning ninety times in place, and then launched eight slashes upwards with the added rotational force. Jin Mayeol staggered but regained his stance.

*Splash!*

The terrain changed again. Our sword techniques also changed. Due to Yukrin's shed skin, the terrain kept changing, and I had to continuously control the terrain with the Changing Valley technique to create a favorable environment for myself.

*Clang, clang, clang!*

Despite everything, Jin Mayeol was still a formidable opponent. He pressured me with his attacks, which were tightly integrated with his martial arts. In an instant, we exchanged dozens, hundreds, thousands of blows.

*Thud!*

A golden stone bounced up, and Jin Mayeol swung his divine spear at me along with the stone. The stone shattered, scattering fragments everywhere. Some of the fragments rushed towards me. I scattered sword energy with the Mountain and Water technique, deflecting all the fragments towards Jin Mayeol's eyes. Then, I switched techniques, using the Twelve Techniques of the Single Peak Sword to concentrate an overwhelming amount of sword energy on his spear.

*Crack!*

His spear broke. 

*Splash!*

With about three more changes in the terrain, we exchanged countless blows, and seventy-seven of Jin Mayeol's divine weapons were destroyed. Every time I destroyed one of his divine weapons, his expression twisted like a demon. It was a thrilling feeling, unlike when I destroyed Kim Younghoon's weapons.

We exchanged sword strikes. His demon saber grazed past my eyes, and I twisted the trajectory of my sword to strike his saber upwards, then used the Dragon Vein technique to smash his saber.

We exchanged blows. His demon sword aimed at my earlobe, then tried to slash my neck with a follow-up move, but the trajectory of my Total Heaven Sword changed bizarrely, deflecting the attack, and I used the Layered Mountains technique to create a thicket of sword energy, restricting his movements. Taking advantage of the momentary pause, I concentrated the Changing Valley technique on his demon sword, shattering it with vibrations.

We exchanged intentions. I barely dodged his dual attack aimed at my groin and face, feeling a strand of my hair get cut. Then, I used the Flowing Ridge technique to stab my sword into Jin Mayeol's mouth, and with the Echoing Mountains technique, I channeled sword energy into his intestines, shaking his entire body. As he coughed up blood, I tore apart the iron mace in his left hand.

*Crash!*

We exchanged techniques again, destroying three more of his divine weapons. How many times had we exchanged blows by now? The only weapon left in his hand was the divine sword Gairyeok, which he had first grabbed. Jin Mayeol was grinding his teeth, his eyes half-rolled back.

“You bastard… my precious weapons…!”

“Since when were they your precious weapons? They belonged to Yukrin.”

“Shut up! I'll kill you!”

He raged, holding Gairyeok in his right hand and transforming his left hand into a monstrous sword, wildly swinging his techniques.

“I'll show you the power of a divine treasure!”

*Flash!*

Once again, a terrifying white sword light grazed past me. It was indeed a formidable strike. Despite having destroyed all of Yukrin's weapons, I couldn't break Gairyeok because its power was beyond my expectations.

‘This is troublesome.’

*Thud, thud!*

I tried to stimulate Gairyeok several times, but it didn't work. It was too solid.

*Boom!*

Jin Mayeol swung Gairyeok again. Flame Crystal, being the core of the non-immortal formation, allowed access to the lower realms. In other words, it was a mineral that interfered with dimensions. Because it interfered with dimensions, the Flame Crystal ship of the Demon Sea Pirates could freely dive and navigate the deep sea. And the power of the Gairyeok sword, made of Flame Crystal, was akin to the power of a divine sword that could cut through space, even with the thinned energy.

*Slash!*

*Splash!*

As I dodged Gairyeok, Yukrin's shed skin moved, and Gairyeok's slash directly hit the waist of the shed skin.

*Snap!*

The waist of Yukrin's shed skin was cut off. The shed skin went berserk, wriggling madly.

‘I can't break that.’

I instinctively knew. The replica of the divine treasure made by the Heavenly Artisan. No, to be precise, it was said to be a failed attempt, but I could feel it. This Gairyeok sword was a divine sword of insane perfection. If this sword alone could pressure me as much as a fusion stage puppet, would you believe it? This sword alone was equivalent to the Northern Fleet. Honestly, even I, who had no desire for magical treasures, felt my heart waver. And such a crazy artifact was being wielded by a warrior at the condensation stage. If Kim Younghoon wielded this, I couldn't guarantee victory even with my main body, and if Jang Ik wielded this, I could confidently say that no one could stop him from conquering the Guanghan Realm.

However.

“…Pathetic.”

Instead of swinging my sword, I coldly looked at Jin Mayeol, who was being consumed by the potential of Gairyeok and was being controlled by the sword.

“Is this the martial prowess of the Thief Nobles?”

Initially, Jin Mayeol's attacks had the form of the Thief Nobles' martial arts, but as he swung Gairyeok more, his form became increasingly distorted and disordered.

“Shut up!!!”

“Foolish…”

I clicked my tongue and focused my mind. Since the start of the battle, Jin Mayeol had never landed a valid hit on me. Although there was a difference in cultivation level, it was laughable considering that I had fought Kim Younghoon on equal terms right after reaching the Heaven Piercing Realm. At that time, I had at least pressured Kim Younghoon with my strength. But what about this guy? He had no Three-Talents technique. Despite having a higher cultivation level than me, holding a far superior weapon, and being older than me, he was being toyed with by me, and his precious treasures were being destroyed.

“Your martial arts have rotted with greed.”

I mocked his sword, deflecting the monstrous sword aimed at my side and thrusting my Total Heaven Sword towards Gairyeok, which was aiming for my eyes.

*Puk!*

In the next moment, blood splattered. My Total Heaven Sword accurately pierced Jin Mayeol's grip, stopping his sword's advance.

*Boom!*

*Splash!*

In the next moment, my Total Heaven Sword pierced thousands of times in an instant, shattering Jin Mayeol's grip.

‘Tsk.’

However, his body clung stickily to the sword.

‘Even if he's rotten, he's still at the condensation stage.’

I made up my mind.

‘Even if I suffer some losses, I have to use that.’

*Splash!*

The terrain changed again. Unfortunately, this time the change gave him a slight advantage, and I was slightly below him. Without a chance to adjust the terrain with the Changing Valley technique, he charged at me.

‘It doesn't matter.’

I moved my sword.

*Tsaah!*

The Total Heaven Sword began to cry. Despite the thinned energy due to the Flame Crystal Palace, my body and the Total Heaven Sword also became faint. However, in that situation, the Total Heaven Sword became clear again. The sword moved. Following the trajectory of the sword, a hazy mist trailed behind. The thirty-first technique of the Single Peak Sword, which I began to create in the High Power Realm, combining all my experiences. This was my history.
