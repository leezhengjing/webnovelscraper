### Return to Cultivation (Chapter 383): Together with Everyone (5)

I first wandered around the village to gather information.

‘Half of the villagers here are members of the Wujigyo Sect.’

Among them were my comrades: Jeon Myeonghun, Kim Yeon, Buk Hyanghwa, Yeonwi, and Yeonjin. It seemed I would need to visit other villages to find the rest of my comrades.

‘The place where I landed is called Bongrae (蓬萊).’

Bongrae was roughly the size of India on Earth. Currently, the Wujigyo Sect had expanded its influence significantly, and when all 400 million members of the sect fell into Bongrae, they became the citizens of the ‘Bongrae Kingdom,’ which was estimated to have a population of several hundred million.

‘Of course, this is just speculation.’

There was a possibility that not all of them became citizens; some might have been reborn as beasts, monsters, or even real ghosts. Bongrae Kingdom was divided into a central capital and seven provinces excluding the capital. Each province was divided into ten cities, each city into several counties and districts, and below the districts were villages.

‘The name of this village is Taeulchon (太乙村).’

Yeonwi’s husband, Taewon, was the village chief and a local notable, nicknamed ‘Nolbu Old Man.’ Jeon Myeonghun, Yeonwi’s brother, was a relative of Nolbu’s family and was called ‘Heungbu’s family.’ This seemed to be influenced by the fairy tales remembered by Jeon Myeonghun, Kim Yeon, and me.

‘Except that Heungbu and Nolbu get along well.’

Jeon Myeonghun had a good relationship with Geum Sohae, and they had twelve children together. Nolbu Daegam Heonwon was a good husband who listened well to Yeonwi, and thus, Jeon Myeonghun, Yeonwi’s brother, took good care of him. Jeon Myeonghun and Geum Sohae managed their household frugally, so they didn’t need much help.

Buk Hyanghwa and Kim Yeon were half-sisters, as Kim Yeon’s father had remarried a stepmother with a daughter. Kim Yeon’s father passed away early, and the stepmother favored Buk Hyanghwa, but Buk Hyanghwa got along well with Kim Yeon, making it a twisted version of the ‘Cinderella’ story.

‘So, have I become a fairy tale protagonist too? But what kind of fairy tale has a charcoal burner as the protagonist?’

I pondered but couldn’t recall any fairy tale with a charcoal burner as the protagonist.

‘Should I carry Kim Yeon on my back and go around slaying monsters?’

With such idle thoughts, I looked around the village and then headed to the back mountain, near the charcoal kiln where Seo Eunhyun, the charcoal burner, worked. The kiln was in poor condition, almost collapsing, as if Seo Eunhyun hadn’t managed it well.

‘He always produced poor-quality charcoal, didn’t he?’

Moreover, Seo Eunhyun would sell the poor-quality charcoal for a pittance and then go to the neighboring village, Soeulchon, to indulge in drinking, singing, and gambling with a neighbor named Sodong. As a result, he had no savings.

‘…Was he just a hopeless guy?’

I sighed and picked up a rusty axe next to the kiln.

‘I thought of selling the kiln to raise money and leave for another village… but who would buy such a dilapidated kiln?’

I shook my head.

“Foolish guy…”

No wonder he was poor, doing a business like charcoal selling that didn’t sell well.

‘In this era, the best way to make money is soap selling. Charcoal selling is foolish!’

I opened the kiln. It was filled with a lot of ash.

‘If I get some oil and turn all this ash into soap…’

Old memories made my hands itch. I wanted to make soap right away.

“No, this isn’t it.”

I resisted the temptation of soap selling and began searching under the kiln, recalling Seo Eunhyun’s memories.

“Found it…”

I found a poker under the kiln. The pointed end looked good for use as a weapon. Holding the axe and the poker, I entered the forest.

‘According to Yukrin’s investigation log, the way to gather comrades in this formation is not to foolishly wander around the seven provinces but to make them come to you.’

And the best way to call comrades was to achieve ‘great deeds.’ By accomplishing something noteworthy in this world, one’s status would gradually rise, and those I sought would appear before me.

‘According to Seo Eunhyun’s memories, there’s a monster living on the mountain ridge beyond Taeulchon’s back mountain.’

The monster would come down the mountain at night to eat livestock and sometimes even people, causing the villagers to live in constant fear. Only a shunned charcoal burner like me would go up the back mountain.

I decided to meet the monster.

‘The monster could be a comrade, and I need to gauge the level of monsters in this world.’

The only thing to be wary of in this world seemed to be monsters. Other than that, unless a thousand or more soldiers or constables came, they weren’t much of a threat.

How long had I wandered in the forest? I realized I had entered the monster’s territory. White fur was scattered all over the forest.

“This is…”

I approached the fur, picked it up, and sniffed it, immediately recognizing the monster’s identity.

“Oh… this monster…”

And then, thud! A familiar giant fox with three tails appeared before me. The fox glared at me with red eyes, baring its teeth as if it would devour me at any moment. It was Siho.

I looked at Siho for a moment and then asked indifferently.

“So… are you demanding an arm for trespassing in your territory?”

This was a nostalgic and familiar situation.

“No, you bastard.”

Siho, having completely reverted to a beast after falling into Bongrae Kingdom, lost its reason and charged at me. I quickly controlled my muscles perfectly and climbed a nearby tree, mapping out the surrounding terrain and planning my battle route.

Siho, after looking around for a moment, found me and bit the tree I had climbed with its huge mouth.

Crunch! Crack!

After biting and hitting the tree about a dozen times, the tree showed signs of falling.

‘Judging by its muscles and the strength it exerted, it’s about as strong as two or three bears combined.’

Calmly and with a cold gaze, I moved to another tree like a monkey and observed Siho. The beast, in a frenzy, continued to smash trees, and as I kept evading, it roared even louder in anger. At some point, I saw its muscles swell.

‘Ho…’

Simultaneously, Siho leaped from the ground and flew towards me at the top of the tree, mouth wide open. I smirked and gripped the poker upside down. If I stabbed it with the pointed end, it could die, so I intended to use it as a club.

“Is that all you’ve got?”

The reason Siho always bit off my arm in the early days of my cultivation wasn’t because of its size or appearance. This damned mutt was a demon beast of the decision realm, and once it started using its demonic arts, it was impossible to fight against it. However, now that it had fallen into Bongrae Kingdom, Siho only resembled its former self in appearance. It couldn’t use demonic arts, had no reason, and only amplified its physical abilities with demonic energy, making it no different from a low-level demon beast of the early performance realm.

And at this level…

‘I can capture it with my eyes closed, even without spiritual power or internal energy.’

To test my physical capabilities, I charged at Siho, who was rushing at me, with the axe and poker. I kicked its jaw and quickly moved behind it, stabbing the poker into the muscle gap in its shoulder and grabbing its fur tightly. Siho screamed and fell from the tree, but before it hit the ground, it twisted its body to land and ran around wildly to shake me off. However, I read its muscles, predicted all its movements, and skillfully stayed on its back. When it showed an opening, I reached for its head.

Crunch!

Squeezing all my muscles, I focused my breath for a moment and concentrated the muscle power in one spot. In an instant, I struck the back of Siho’s head with the force of a palm strike, feeling its brain shake. The beast’s eyes rolled back, and it fainted.

“Phew…”

I got off Siho’s body and checked my condition. Using my body without spiritual power had taken a toll on me.

‘Without spiritual power, even capturing a beast like this without injury is challenging.’

If I could use even a bit of spiritual power, I could have captured Siho much more easily. After calming my surprised muscles, I stood up, recalling the surrounding terrain I had observed earlier.

‘Siho kept circling around one spot to shake me off.’

That spot was likely Siho’s lair. I checked Siho’s consciousness and, realizing it would take time for it to wake up, headed to its lair.

‘It would be nice if the monster had some treasure.’

And then, I found an unexpected ‘treasure.’

“Senior!!! Did you get captured too!?”

It was Seoran.

“…No, I came to rescue you.”

Unexpectedly, I met another comrade who had regained consciousness, and I smiled.

“…First, let’s hear what happened.”

* * *

Crackle, crackle, crackle!

I lit a fire and roasted the corpses Siho had left in its lair. Then, as Siho, who had regained consciousness and returned to the lair, lay down submissively, I asked.

“So, as soon as you regained consciousness, Siho kidnapped you, and you’ve been here for a few days?”

“Yes, that’s right. It seems it still has an attachment to me even here.”

Interestingly, Seoran was of the ‘human’ race.

“My setting… seems to be a homeless orphan who lost her memory. I have no other memories except that my identity is a ‘rootless orphan.’ I haven’t met any other comrades besides Siho so far.”

“Hmm…”

Listening to him gave me a headache.

‘What are the conditions for regaining consciousness? Is it just random?’

Seoran wasn’t particularly long-lived, mentally strong, or highly cultivated. Yet, it seemed he had regained consciousness even before me. I thought about what might be the common factors between Seoran and me.

‘Seoran is a homeless orphan. And I am a poor charcoal burner.’

Both of us were starving. 

‘Could it be that one’s consciousness must be on the brink of life and death to regain it?’

I formed such a hypothesis and looked at Siho.

“Hey Seoran, if I push this guy to the brink of death, will it regain its consciousness?”

Seoran shook his head in shock.

“Please don’t.”

“…?”

“Well, if it doesn’t work, we might end up killing Siho for no reason.”

Siho, who had been tense at my words, relaxed as Seoran seemed to dissuade me, and I nodded.

“Well, that’s true. So, what should we do…”

“I think this will take some time. There are too few cases, and we don’t know the conditions. So, instead of focusing on gathering comrades, how about concentrating on achieving great deeds as you initially planned?”

“Hmm… indeed.”

I nodded. Whether we tortured Siho or not, nothing would change. So, it seemed the priority was to achieve great deeds, raise my reputation, and let the comrades come to me.

“Alright. Then let’s plan…”

Growl—

Suddenly, Seoran’s stomach growled. I looked at Seoran for a moment and handed him the roasted meat. Seoran devoured the meat quickly, but I noticed his malnourished state. Unlike Seo Eunhyun, who had extorted money to eat, Seoran, as a homeless orphan with amnesia, seemed severely malnourished.

“…First, let’s go to my house and feed you. Then we can plan.”

I couldn’t let Seoran starve to death, so I decided to feed him and then discuss our plans. We ordered Siho to stay and descended the mountain. Siho seemed to want to follow Seoran, but after a bit of discipline, it became very obedient, so there was no problem.

Back home, I washed the rice that Yeonwi had given me, which was mixed with sand and gravel. Surprisingly, the rice, which had filled a scoop, was reduced to a few handfuls after washing away the sand and gravel. I explained to Seoran about the rice Yeonwi had given and apologized for the small amount.

‘…Yeonwi, that person. I should kidnap and hang her upside down someday.’

Influenced by Seo Eunhyun, unpleasant thoughts surged up. I somehow managed to cook the insufficient rice, and Seoran ate it with soy sauce, despite the many stones still in it. Then he gave me his opinion.

“How about becoming bandits?”

“Bandits?”

“Yes. We can use Siho to raid villages. Since Yeonwi hasn’t regained consciousness yet, if we raid her granary and make her starve like us, won’t she regain consciousness?”
