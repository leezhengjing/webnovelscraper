### Return to Cultivation (회귀수선전) Chapter 391: Drinking Deeply (1)

*Shwaaah—*

The sound of the dimensional flow, reminiscent of waves, echoed around me. I looked around with a hollow gaze. After Yukrin took the palace of Yeomjeong, the illusionary formation itself collapsed. It seemed that all the sacrificial books and treasures I had aimed for were inside that palace, making them impossible to find. In other words, the axis of Yuho Deok was out of reach. Although I had suspected that obtaining treasures from the palace might be a trap due to Yukrin's last words, it was quite disheartening to lose even the chance to confirm the trap.

"......"

We stared at the sky with vacant eyes, then gathered in one place after organizing the scattered Guangyin Sect members and disciples who had fallen to one side of Bongrae Island. Not everyone was present; there were missing persons. Wishi Hon reported the missing in a somber voice.

"The Thirteenth Guardian King and my friend, Baekrin, has disappeared."

"It seems he flew towards Princess Yukyo inside the palace for the last time. Since the palace itself was taken by Yukrin, Baekrin might have been captured by Yukrin."

Baekrin was missing. From what I heard, he was captured by Yukrin while trying to save Yukyo. I let out a deep sigh. The journey to Bongrae Island had cost us too much. We discussed the details of the incident, including the missing persons.

*Shwaaah—*

The meeting room was silent. Yeonwi, Jeon Myeonghun, Oh Hyunseok, and others had lost their vitality due to the unpleasant and gloomy dreams they had on Bongrae Island. Some were too dumbfounded or annoyed by the current situation to speak. However, I forced myself to speak. We couldn't just sit around in despair. Yeonwi seemed to understand this as well, and we exchanged opinions.

"What should we do now?"

"...We should try to escape first."

"Do you have any methods?"

"Yeonghun and I left avatars on the sea. They are avatars of the Sim Clan that can communicate in real-time."

Yeonwi stroked her chin and asked, "If we don't escape immediately, does that mean there's a problem?"

"Yes. The avatars of the Sim Clan have exhausted a lot of energy in the battle with Yukrin. They are currently hiding to avoid being discovered by Yukrin and can't do anything. Even if we send manpower through the avatars and pull from both sides..."

"We've come too deep."

"Yes. The force won't reach."

The sea of the Goryeok Realm is a collection of dimensions. Although it doesn't seem to go down that far, what lies between the sea surface and our location is not seawater but 'dimensions.' We have to extend our force through countless dimensions to get out, and only a cultivator at the Shattering Stage can emit such force.

Yeonwi looked at Kim Yeonghun and said, "Isn't Neunggwang Shinma currently communicating with Hamcheon Jonja? Can't we get some help from Hamcheon Jonja?"

Kim Yeonghun shook his head awkwardly. "I'm sorry, but what I'm doing is 'communing' with the enlightenment of that Jonja, not 'communicating.' If it's about communication, Seo Eunhyun might be better."

Yeonwi's gaze shifted back to me. I also shook my head. "To help us, Hamcheon Jonja's avatar would have to come here directly. From what I know, it would take him over a hundred years to get here."

"A hundred years... well, that's worth waiting for."

She nodded, but my expression darkened. 'In just over a hundred years, Kang Minhee will go berserk...'

Moreover, Seo Hyul would regain his 'eye' in a few hundred years. Being trapped here until then was the worst choice. "Is there no faster way to get out?"

"If we create a Thunder Soul, we could do it immediately."

"...No, thank you."

"Yeah, I don't like that idea either. So, do you have any other methods?"

"......"

I sighed. No methods came to mind immediately. "...For now, I'll try contacting the Taesuhui."

Even if we were stuck in the deep sea, we might be able to get out of the Goryeok Realm itself. "Contacting the Taesuhui and having them pull us into the Guanghan Realm might be one way."

Yeonwi nodded, saying it was a good idea, and asked if anyone had gained anything from Bongrae Island. "Although we're trapped now, according to Seo Eunhyun, Hamcheon Jonja can come in a few hundred years, so there's hope. Instead of despairing and sitting down, we should see if we gained anything from Bongrae Island. Did anyone find anything while investigating Bongrae Island?"

Everyone shook their heads. Seoran clicked her tongue and said, "I thought there might be some secret in the salt mountain of Bongrae Island, but it was just a real salt mountain. It was just a lump of salt."

"Hmm... so it's not a special mineral like Yeomjeong? What about the sacrificial books we aimed for when we came here?"

I sighed deeply and said, "From what I can see, those sacrificial books..."

At that moment, Kim Yeon took out something from her bosom with a bitter expression. It was a sacrificial book of Yuho Deok. "When the formation broke, Hyanghwa and I hurried to the library to gather the sacrificial books, but the only one left was this Yuho Deok sacrificial book in my hand. The rest disappeared like smoke."

"...!"

I widened my eyes at the Yuho Deok sacrificial book, and Yeonwi sighed in disappointment. "What a shame... it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to arm all the sect leaders with the Five Blessings Foundation!"

"We have no choice. At least the sect leader can build the Five Blessings Foundation, so we should take comfort in that."

Kim Yeon floated the Yuho Deok sacrificial book towards me, and I caught it. Although the Yuho Deok sacrificial book was in my hands thanks to Kim Yeon, I couldn't shake off the uneasy feeling. It was because of what Yukrin's fragment had said to me after escaping from Jahon Mantian.

- I advise you to quickly gather the sacrificial books you wanted. Once the barrier breaks, the sacrificial books will remain in the world of illusions forever, never to be obtained again...!

Surprisingly, that statement was a lie. And if I think about which part of it was a lie, it was the entire statement from beginning to end. 'He was sure that even if I went to the library to gather the sacrificial books, I would never be able to obtain them.'

But Kim Yeon had obtained a sacrificial book. Was there some secret to this? 'For now, I'll observe the Yuho Deok sacrificial book that Kim Yeon obtained rather than hastily learning from it.'

I publicly praised Kim Yeon and put the Yuho Deok sacrificial book in my bosom. After discussing a few more escape methods, we disbanded the meeting and returned to our respective places. I went back to the underground training hall and activated the Biseonjin formation.

'There's nothing wrong with the Biseonjin formation or other connections to the lower realms.'

After fiddling with the Biseonjin formation for a while, I pondered over the Taesuhui. 'Will they really bring me back?'

I would be lucky if they didn't throw a party celebrating the capture of the Sim Clan spy. "Here is the surveillance mirror, master."

I received the surveillance mirror that Hongbeom brought. It was a surveillance mirror I had obtained along with Yeomjeong when I conquered Jeongryongdo. I infused the surveillance mirror with my spiritual power. As the spiritual power entered, the surveillance mirror began to shine. It was a mirror that could reconnect with worlds I had visited before.

*Wiiing—*

The surveillance mirror emitted light, reflecting numerous light clusters inside. As soon as I saw the light clusters, I could tell which worlds they symbolized. 'This is the Ghost Realm, this is the Thunder Sound Sea, this is the world of Hamjin, these are the celestial realms where I sent my consciousness while building the axis...'

And among them, a familiar light caught my eye. I reached out towards that light.

*Woooong—*

A familiar clear sky appeared beyond the surveillance mirror. 'Guanghan Realm!'

It was a familiar scene from the Guanghan Realm. The name of the Guanghan (光寒) world appeared above the surveillance mirror. After manipulating the surveillance mirror for a while, I figured out how to adjust it to observe specific places by infusing my consciousness.

*Woooong—*

After some manipulation, I was able to project the surveillance mirror onto the front of the Junje's cave at the end of Cheonbongsan Mountain in the In Clan's General Alliance. The surveillance mirror flickered and quickly projected the front of Junje's cave. A heavy voice came from inside his cave. I infused my consciousness into the surveillance mirror and greeted him warmly.

"Jun Dao, it's me! Seo Eunhyun!"

I explained the situation to him with a hearty laugh. I told him that due to some complicated circumstances, I had fallen into the Goryeok Realm and asked the Taesuhui to provide coordinates and manpower to pull us out. After listening to my explanation, Junje let out a contemplative sound and said, "Hmm, I understand, Seo Taesu. Please wait a moment. I will contact you again soon."

"Haha, thank you very much, Dao! I won't forget this favor!"

However, I wasn't entirely in a good mood. 'I can't tell what he's thinking.'

Since the surveillance mirror only showed scenes and transmitted voices, I couldn't tell if Junje was just saying that or if he was actually cheering inside. After thanking Junje and trying to make a few more requests, the screen suddenly distorted, and the connection with the Guanghan Realm was cut off.

"...This is..."

I immediately realized what was happening. Junje had shaken the space with his force to cut off the connection with the surveillance mirror. "...This..."

I gritted my teeth in frustration. Junje was the president of the Taesuhui. His will was the will of the Taesuhui. I realized that the Taesuhui had no intention of rescuing me and ground my teeth. 'Damn it... if it comes to this, how am I supposed to get out!'

The surveillance mirror was controlled by consciousness, but it only transmitted voices and a few scenes, so I couldn't send an avatar through it. I held my throbbing head and pondered for a long time. Then, I felt a strange energy from the surveillance mirror and turned my gaze towards it.

'This is...?'

A familiar light was shining from the top of the surveillance mirror. 'Of course, it would be familiar since it only shows places I've been to, but... this is strange. This feels like...'

The light seemed to resonate subtly with the Goryeok Realm. I could also hear a faint sound of waves from within the light.

*Woooong—*

For some reason, one of my axes, the Gangnyeong Axis (康寧軸), was vibrating intensely and resonating. I forgot my annoyance at the Taesuhui's disregard and reached out towards the light as if possessed. And then.

*Woooong!*

"...!"

I saw a very familiar scene.

*Fwoosh—*

A burning world. Endless burning monsters, remnants of collapsed civilizations everywhere. Riverbeds and basins that were once thought to be filled with water. And the name of the great world that encompassed it all. The name of Gangnyeong Bongyang Sajajeung Ryongjido (康寧奉養使者嶒龍之圖) appeared above the surveillance mirror.

"Jeung Ryong's Twilight Map!"

*Clench!*

I grabbed the surveillance mirror and shouted. I felt a shiver of unknown anticipation. At the level of manipulating force, a cultivator's premonition was close to foresight. I infused my consciousness into the surveillance mirror with a dumbfounded expression.

*Woooong!*

The screen of the surveillance mirror distorted, and it projected the altar of the Bongyang Layer, which connected to the Chije Layer. The vibration of the Gangnyeong Axis, resonating with the energy of Jeung Ryong's Twilight Map, reached its peak. I recalled Seo Hyul's actions from my memory. I floated the Gangnyeong Axis above my hand and twisted the force as Seo Hyul had done.

*Flash!*

The power of Gangnyeong shone through the surveillance mirror. "Gangnyeong Axis (康寧軸), Release (解)."

*Boom, Clang!*

At the same time, the sound of a latch opening or a lock being unlocked echoed from the surveillance mirror, reverberating throughout Bongrae Island.
