### Return to Cultivation (회귀수선전) Chapter 397: Drinking Deeply (7)

Liu Yao, her eyes wild, scattered the numerous magical treasures she had stolen and swallowed the pills. 

“Huff, huff….”

Rumble! 

A dark red demonic fire engulfed Liu Yao, and she gritted her teeth, narrowly avoiding it. 

‘Luckily, his accuracy is low because he’s not in his right mind.’

Wei Yun possessed the early stage of the Heavenly Human Realm, but he was merely a puppet moving without a sound mind. Fortunately, this was why Liu Yao was still alive, but she sensed something strange.

‘Would Father really leave someone so mentally unstable right next to the Xuan Guo Token?’

No matter how she thought about it, it was odd. The Liu Lin she knew would never do that.

‘This is strange. No matter how I think about it, it’s strange.’

If the Liu Lin she knew wouldn’t do such a thing, there was only one answer.

‘There’s a high chance something has happened to Father.’

Perhaps he had entered the early stages of a demonic deviation. Or maybe his mind had fractured while taking over Liu Weng’s body. Whatever it was, it wasn’t the behavior of the Liu Lin she knew.

‘Indeed, ever since he returned from Penglai Island, he’s been more lenient with me.’

Previously, if she was caught trying to run away, she would be punished by having her spiritual power sealed and being hung from the cliff of Zhenglong Island for half a year. He had an attitude that it didn’t matter if she died, but this time, he had merely locked her in a regular prison for a hundred years. Of course, an ordinary person would die if they were locked in an underground prison without food for a hundred years, but she was still a member of the Yuan Ying Clan, so she wouldn’t die.

She could tell.

‘It’s been since he returned from Penglai Island. What’s the reason? Because he returned from Penglai Island? Or because he started seriously cultivating the Ghostly Sea Technique? Or maybe because the Conquering King and the Demonic Sect, the biggest obstacles, are stuck on Penglai Island?’

Rumble!

A giant skeletal figure appeared above Wei Yun’s head.

‘Crazy… What kind of demonic technique is that?’

Liu Yao broke into a cold sweat and lifted the magical tools she had stolen from Zhenglong Palace. At that moment, a buzzing sound was heard.

“What? Are you crazy?”

Liu Yao frowned at Bai Lin, who was buzzing at her waist. 

Muttering….

Wei Yun chanted incantations while gathering the power of the demonic technique, and Bai Lin buzzed even louder at the sight.

“It’s not that I don’t believe you….”

Liu Yao alternated between looking at Bai Lin and Wei Yun’s skeletal figure with anxious eyes, then closed her eyes tightly and grabbed Bai Lin’s skull.

“Fine, I get it!”

Whoosh!

And then, Wei Yun began to move the skeletal figure. At the same time, Liu Yao threw Bai Lin’s skull at Wei Yun’s skeletal figure! Bai Lin’s skull hit the skeletal figure’s hand and shattered into powder.

“Ah….”

Liu Yao’s face turned blank with disbelief. Bai Lin had died too easily.

“No….”

Bai Lin had died so quickly that she couldn’t even feel sadness at the situation. Wei Yun’s skeletal figure screamed as it was engulfed in her demonic fire. The dark red skeletal figure began to gather demonic fire in its hands as if to attack Liu Yao, and flames of demonic energy started to rise from its eye sockets. Just as despair and sorrow began to follow on Liu Yao’s face, something happened.

Sizzle—

Wei Yun’s skeletal figure. Its fingertips began to turn white. Wei Yun looked up at the skeletal figure with blackened eyes, puzzled. For some reason, the figure seemed to be disobeying her commands. Wei Yun infused more demonic energy into the figure, but although it grew larger, the speed at which it turned white did not change. And finally!

Whoosh!

The skeletal figure completely turned white. And then, it seemed to burn with a blue flame. In an instant, flash! The figure turned white-hot, and twenty-eight semi-transparent black nails shot out from inside it. Liu Yao recognized what they were and widened her eyes.

The twenty-eight seals that had blocked Bai Lin’s celestial energy and sealed his spiritual power!

‘If those have come out….’

Rumble!

A tremendous pressure descended upon the chamber. Liu Yao and Wei Yun both fell to their knees, but Liu Yao’s eyes brightened. And then, within the white light, bone powder gathered, and a figure was born. Sizzle— The white light faded, and the figure within it spoke. A ghost cultivator, entirely made of white bones and wearing a white robe.

“You’re really… late.”

Bai Lin withdrew the pressure directed at Liu Yao and pointed a finger at Wei Yun. Wei Yun, still not understanding the situation, exploded and died as soon as Bai Lin pointed at her. Bai Lin reached out towards where Wei Yun had been. Shortly after, Wei Yun’s bones and a strand of her soul floated above Bai Lin’s palm.

“What will you do with that?”

“Are you going to use it as a magical treasure?”

Bai Lin laughed heartily.

“Ah… If it’s a soul soaked in demonic energy, it would be quite powerful if refined into a magical treasure. What a pity.”

At Liu Yao’s words, Bai Lin looked at her and asked.

“Well, it’s just an illusion anyway. What does it matter if you refine a non-human entity from an illusion into a magical treasure?”

Liu Yao lowered her eyes at Bai Lin’s gaze.

“…If you swear to follow me, I won’t do it again.”

Bai Lin looked at Liu Yao for a moment, then silently released the seals on her without answering.

Clink, clink, clink!

Three nails, similar to those that had been embedded in Bai Lin’s celestial energy, came out of Liu Yao’s body. Liu Yao regained her cultivation and immediately dispersed the seals on the Xuan Guo Token before taking it from the altar.

“Got it! Finally!”

Her eyes filled with joy. The name ‘Liu Weng’ on the Xuan Guo Token shone auspiciously. She held the token in her trembling hands and placed it in her bosom. Bai Lin, watching her, asked curiously.

“Why don’t you just put it in the storage ring? As the Lord of Zhenglong Palace, they must have placed tracking spells on it. Even if it’s not a tracking spell, they can sense Liu Weng’s token.”

“No, items like the Xuan Guo Token or the Xuan Guo Seal are very fragile and can easily break. They’re replicas of the ‘real Xuan Guo Token’ after all.”

“Hmm… Even if it’s a replica, it’s surprising that an item presiding over a contract of the fusion stage is this fragile….”

Bai Lin looked at the black token with curiosity and then turned his head.

“Now then. Let’s get out of here.”

And just as they were about to leave the chamber, rumble! A loud noise echoed from above the altar where the Xuan Guo Token had been. A teleportation array appeared, and the entire chamber seemed to distort as if it were separating from the surrounding dimension, turning into a droplet shape. Liu Yao let out a hollow laugh as if she had realized something.

“Ha… So taking the Xuan Guo Token from the altar turns the area into a ‘middle zone’… Father didn’t leave the Xuan Guo Token to be guarded by someone else for no reason.”

“Hmm….”

Bai Lin tried to distort the void through the gravitational force to create a hole in the droplet, but only the dark scenery of the ‘deep sea’ was visible outside.

“It’s useless. This middle zone itself has separated from Zhenglong Island and fallen into the middle of the deep sea… If we leave here, we’ll become lost in the deep sea.”

Bai Lin looked at her and asked.

“Didn’t Princess Liu Yao say she could find her way in the deep sea?”

But Liu Yao lowered her head in embarrassment at his words.

“…That was a lie to push the pursuit of the True Demon Heat onto you, Bai Lin. My Sea Dragon Bloodline is not enough. Maybe if it were Princess Se Ran.”

At her words, Bai Lin nodded and said.

“In that case… the only options are to return the Xuan Guo Token or….”

Their gazes turned to the teleportation array above the altar.

“Ride that teleportation array and reach the other side connected to this middle zone.”

“….”

“Princess?”

But Bai Lin was puzzled as he looked at Liu Yao, who had a dark expression.

“…I have a feeling I know where that teleportation array leads.”

“Where is it?”

“…It’s probably to Yinglong Island… Yinglong Island is also a deep sea island. It’s impossible to get out anyway.”

“That’s….”

Liu Yao, with a gloomy expression, placed the Xuan Guo Token back on the altar. The chamber, which had turned into a droplet, returned to the inside of Zhenglong Island.

“We have no choice. Let’s join the leader’s party first, and then we can try to take it again.”

After saying that to Liu Yao, Bai Lin walked towards the chamber door. Liu Yao, unable to let go of the Xuan Guo Token, looked at it with regret. And just as Bai Lin opened the chamber door.

Creak—

Liu Yao and Bai Lin were met with the sight of Liu Lin’s clone, who had a sinister expression.

Boom!

Bai Lin quickly closed the door, and Liu Yao, breaking into a cold sweat, took the Xuan Guo Token from the altar again. The chamber immediately turned back into a middle zone, settling deep within the sea. Bai Lin spoke in a low voice.

“…That person just now….”

“…Yes, it’s Father’s main body.”

What they saw was Liu Lin’s main body. To be precise, it was Liu Lin’s main body before he took over Liu Weng’s body, which had reached at least the mid-fusion stage. Although it was just a clone compared to Liu Lin, who had taken over Liu Weng’s body, even that clone was at the mid-fusion stage. Bai Lin couldn’t possibly handle it.

Bai Lin looked at the teleportation array and spoke in a low voice.

“…In the end, there’s no other way.”

“…Indeed.”

Shortly after, Bai Lin and Liu Yao closed their eyes tightly and stepped onto the teleportation array. The light of the array enveloped them, and they disappeared from the array. They had gone to Yinglong Island, the deep sea island beneath Zhenglong Island.

* * *

“Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it…!”

In front of the chamber. Liu Lin’s clone, with bloodshot eyes, was drawing a formation with his own blood. It was a teleportation array.

“No, no! I can’t allow them to escape! Liu Yao must be in my hands. Liu Yao must be in my hands. Liu Yao must be in my hands!!!”

Liu Lin, who seemed mentally unstable, chanted Liu Yao’s name as he infused spiritual energy into the array. Crackle! The blood of the array seemed to burn, and the array activated. It was the teleportation array leading to the middle zone where Liu Yao and Bai Lin had just been. And just as Liu Lin, with bloodshot eyes, was about to step onto the array.

“Where are you going, Lord of Zhenglong Palace?”

A man in white, holding a void in his hand, smiled as he asked from behind Liu Lin. Liu Lin gritted his teeth and glared at him with bloodshot eyes.

“You demonic sect leader…! Don’t interfere with me…! I must get Liu Yao back!!!”

* * *

Liu Lin had gone mad. That was the only conclusion I could come to.

‘Is it because he cultivated the Ghostly Sea Technique? Or is there another reason?’

In any case, his mind was grotesquely twisted, and his thoughts were filled with obsession and possessiveness. And judging by the circumstances, that obsession was directed at Liu Yao.

‘This isn’t a normal mental illness. Nor is it a normal heart demon.’

I knew well because I had experienced mental illness and demonic deviation. If he had a mental illness, it should have manifested as an obsession with salt related to the Ghostly Sea Technique he had cultivated, or a split personality due to the Self-Soul Mantra. It was strange for him to suddenly have such possessiveness towards a daughter he previously didn’t care about and would kill if she disobeyed.

‘Has some external entity intervened?’

That was the only conclusion I could come to. But why Liu Yao? That was still a mystery.

“What’s that teleportation array? It looks like it’s related to the middle zone.”

“Shut up! If you interfere with me, I’ll kill you, demonic sect leader!”

“Foolish. This is just a clone. It’s pitiful. To think that the majestic Dragon King who once trapped the entire Wujig Sect in a trap has become such a deranged old man.”

I clicked my tongue as I looked at Liu Lin, whose eyes were bloodshot and who was gradually transforming into a dragon.

“And you seem to be mistaken. The one I had trouble dealing with was your main body, not someone like you.”

“You dare….”

Boom!

I struck Liu Lin’s mouth with a blow from the Left Hand of Oblivion, and while he was momentarily stunned, I delivered several more blows. Boom, boom, boom! Liu Lin’s body was torn into several pieces and flung out of Zhenglong Palace.

“What a pity.”

I clicked my tongue and stepped onto the teleportation array Liu Lin had created, activating it. Flash!

* * *

After crossing the middle zone, I finally arrived on the other side and frowned.

“…Another deep sea island.”

Honestly, being trapped on Penglai Island, I was getting tired of deep sea islands.

“So this is Yinglong Island. In that case….”

The True Demon Heat would probably enter here soon. After all, Liu Lin was being targeted by Kim Younghoon. Zhenglong Island was my target. Yinglong Island was targeted by the True Demon Heat’s Soul Bone Tiger. It was possible because the Soul Bone Tiger, which could roam the deep sea, could enter here.

‘Tsk, it would have been nice if the Soul Bone Tiger could come down to Penglai Island.’

Unfortunately, the deep sea where Penglai Island was submerged was too deep for the Soul Bone Tiger to enter easily. I cleared my mind of idle thoughts and looked around, quickly finding Liu Yao. And Bai Lin, who was with her.

“Bai Lin, Liu Yao!”

“Ah… Leader.”

Bai Lin turned to me, showing a sense of relief. However, Liu Yao, despite hearing that I had arrived, was staring blankly at something.

“…? Bai Lin, what is Liu Yao looking at?”

Since I couldn’t use my consciousness as well as my main body, I couldn’t immediately see what they were looking at. I approached Liu Yao and looked at what she was staring at. It was a mural. And when I saw the painting on the mural, my eyes narrowed. Because at the bottom of the mural, there were familiar characters written in a familiar handwriting.

- I thought deeply about it. The reason he gave such an excessive gift to the maggots. It wasn’t to help the maggots. It was surely to release the ancient power.

The characters were exactly the same as those written in the hidden library at the top of the Fengming Star.
