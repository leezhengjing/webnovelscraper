### Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 394: Drinking In (4)

Wuuung!

As I operated the incantation of the 'Zihun Mantian,' the Yuan Ying within me trembled. Then, the Yuan Ying seemed to be dyed purple for a moment, transforming into something with an alien nature.

‘What is this…?’

I could feel it. My Yuan Ying had now become the most suitable form for 'seizing another's body.'

‘Is the Zihun Mantian a secret art for seizing someone’s body…?’

I furrowed my brows and delved deeper into the Zihun Mantian. Just as I was about to continue operating the incantation of the Zihun Mantian, it happened.

Wuuung- Crackle!

“…!”

My Yuan Ying, which had turned purple, suddenly convulsed and released its magical power. After a while, the Yuan Ying, which had been dyed purple by the Zihun Mantian, returned to its original state. The nature of the Yuan Ying, altered by the Zihun Mantian, had reverted.

‘What is this….’

However, I focused more on another phenomenon than the fact that the spell had been undone.

‘The incantation of the spell resisted as if it were alive when I tried to activate it.’

It was a very bizarre occurrence.

‘Is this why Jin Mayeol said we couldn’t obtain the Zihun Mantian?’

To activate a spell, one must infuse spiritual power into the incantation and trigger it. However, when spiritual power is infused into the incantation of the Zihun Mantian, it resists as if it were alive and then dissipates.

‘An incantation cannot be alive. Even if spiritual power is infused into the incantation, it’s merely a mass of spiritual energy, not a soul. But something that isn’t a soul is moving as if it were alive?’

Interestingly, I knew of something similar.

‘It’s like the deep-sea monsters.’

In the depths of the Goryeok Realm, monsters born from the amalgamation of memories and histories of a destroyed world. These were the deep-sea monsters of the Goryeok Realm.

‘Is this why Jin Mayeol tried so hard to imitate the body of the Haeryong Tribe and transform into one using the Dragon Form Transformation Art?’

The Haeryong Tribe is a race that can navigate the depths of the Goryeok Realm. Jin Mayeol must have hoped that the Haeryong Tribe could somehow control the incantation of the Zihun Mantian, which is akin to a deep-sea monster.

However, after experiencing the incantation of the Zihun Mantian, I shook my head.

‘Can the Haeryong Tribe really control this technique, which is no different from a deep-sea monster?’

Honestly, it seemed highly unlikely.

‘But Yukrin is using it. So Jin Mayeol must be approaching Yukrin to ask about the usage of the Zihun Mantian.’

This meant that the Zihun Mantian was related to the Haeryong Tribe.

‘The Zihun Jade Seal of Ziyin….’

Zihun Mantian. Takhun Mantian. Haeryong King Seo Hyul. Yukrin, who possesses the body of a Haeryong. Yeomhae Guiro Jade. Yukyo. Bongrae Island and Yeomjeong. Goryeok Realm. ….

‘It feels like all of these are connected somehow.’

But I couldn’t figure out exactly how they were connected. It was frustrating.

As I pondered, unable to find an answer, I decided to move my Zuo Talu Wang clone. And then it happened.

“…Wait.”

I suddenly stopped trying to move my Zuo Talu Wang clone and recalled the incantation of the Zihun Mantian.

“Wait, wait, wait…!”

Something seemed to be coming to mind. The Zuo Talu Wang clone. And the incantation of the Zihun Mantian. And the fact that Yukrin used the Zihun Mantian to hide in the realm of souls, evading the eyes of Kim Younghoon and me!

That’s right! The Zihun Mantian, like the strike of the Zuo Talu Wang, is entirely within the realm of souls!

Wuuuuung!

I focused my consciousness and chanted the incantation of the Zihun Mantian, dyeing my Yuan Ying. Immediately, I infused my Yuan Ying into the Chongcheon Sword and swung it towards the void!

The strike of the Zuo Talu Wang!

Tssaaa!

The Yuan Ying, combined with the incantation of the Zihun Mantian and the strike of the Zuo Talu Wang, began to ascend completely into the realm of souls.

Buuuuung!

‘I can see it.’

Upon ascending to the realm of souls, I could see the structure of the Zihun Mantian!

‘It binds the Qi (氣) to the soul.’

Qi (氣) carries history. In other words, Qi is information. From the realm of souls, I could understand.

Wuuung-

‘The incantation of the Zihun Mantian gathers Qi on its own and collects information bodies inside, functioning similarly to a human soul.’

And the artificial soul created in this way moved like a deep-sea monster, trying to escape my control.

Kuguguk!

With my Yuan Ying and the Zuo Talu Wang clone, I captured this deep-sea monster-like information body in the complete realm of souls.

Kugugugugu!

The information body created by the incantation of the Zihun Mantian struggled madly, trying to escape from the grasp of me and my clone. But with the combined power of my Yuan Ying and the Zuo Talu Wang, the information body was eventually subdued.

Kwaduduk!

I tightly grasped the subdued information body and focused my consciousness. When I opened my eyes again, I had managed to obtain the Zihun Mantian, which, though it seemed to resist my control, still obeyed to some extent.

‘Ha… Jin Mayeol, you bastard.’

If Jin Mayeol knew this, he would lose his mind.

‘For someone who has reached the Zuo Talu Wang, mastering the Zihun Mantian is incredibly easy. From the beginning….’

Of course, I still only had the reins of the Zihun Mantian and hadn’t fully controlled it. It seemed almost impossible to completely control it, as the Zihun Mantian was extremely unruly. It felt like I was forcing it to move by pressing it down with the power of the Zuo Talu Wang in the realm of souls.

‘Without the power to reach the realm of souls, mastering it would be impossible.’

As I operated the Zihun Mantian, I closed my eyes and moved the purple-dyed Yuan Ying in the void.

Wuuung-

The Yuan Ying melted into the darkness in the void and reappeared ten zhang away in an instant.

“…I see!”

I finally understood the principle behind Seo Hyul’s use of the Takhun Mantian to infiltrate my ‘shadow.’

The Zihun Mantian allows movement through darkness, similar to the heart language of the Sim Tribe. Assuming that the Zihun Mantian and the Takhun Mantian share the same root, Seo Hyul must have hidden the Takhun Mantian in the darkness and attached it to my shadow like the heart language.

‘And the reason Yukrin could invade my mind as soon as I sat on the throne of Bongrae Kingdom must be the same principle.’

Yukrin must have hidden his Zihun Mantian clone in the shadow of the throne of Bongrae Kingdom. When I sat on the throne, merging my shadow with the throne’s shadow, he invaded my mind.

‘He didn’t just walk out from behind the throne for no reason.’

Srrk, srrk, srrrk….

Since Bongrae Island was currently submerged in the deep sea, it was quite dark around. Thanks to that, I experimented with the movement technique of the Zihun Mantian, appearing and disappearing in various places on Bongrae Island as if teleporting.

‘In the darkness, it’s a secret art that allows movement anywhere, similar to the heart language of the Sim Tribe.’

This was part of the power of the Zihun Mantian.

‘I think I understand one more principle of the Takhun Mantian.’

In the deep darkness of Seo Hyul’s mind. The reason why Seo Hyul’s mind, which must be far away, can communicate and exchange the Five Blessings and Seven Calamities across vast spacetime. It’s because, like the Zihun Mantian, the Takhun Mantian also has the ability to move anywhere in the darkness, similar to the heart language.

After retrieving my Yuan Ying, I activated the Zihun Mantian again.

Srrr-

Since my physical body didn’t belong to the realm of souls, it didn’t completely disappear, but I could hide in the darkness as if melting into it.

‘And in this state.’

I swung the Chongcheon Sword towards the void.

Buuung!

Moonlight Palace’s Void!

In the darkness where no one’s gaze could reach. I unfolded the Moonlight Palace’s Void, cutting off even the perception of those belonging to the darkness.

“…Heh, hehahahaha!”

And I laughed. It wasn’t a meaningless laugh. With the Zihun Mantian, I could now enter the same darkness as Seo Hyul. If we could both stand in the same darkness, the next step was to identify each other in that darkness! And I had the Moonlight Palace’s Void!

“Hahahahaha!!!”

Seo Hyul. Now, even if you find your eyes, I won’t be afraid! I had obtained an important weapon to face him. It was a very valuable experience.

Crack-

Of course, the downside was that the Zihun Mantian struggled madly, requiring considerable mental strength to restrain it.

‘Using the Zihun Mantian might restrict my martial arts a bit.’

The number of times I could unleash the strike of the Zuo Talu Wang would likely decrease.

‘But when facing Seo Hyul, nothing could be more useful.’

I experimented with the Zihun Mantian a bit more, moving through the darkness. The Zihun Mantian gathered Qi in the realm of Qi, formed information bodies with that Qi, and ascended to the realm of souls. Thanks to the information body that ascended to the realm of souls, my Yuan Ying turned purple.

‘And if I gather and shape this information body….’

Wuuung!

Kugugugu!

A purple mist appeared around the Yuan Ying activated by the Zihun Mantian. The purple mist howled like a fierce beast, trying to escape my control.

“Stay still.”

I controlled the mist with the power of the Zuo Talu Wang and sent a strike beyond the barrier of Bongrae Island, sending a clone outside Bongrae Island.

Kugugugu!

Through the clone, I navigated the dimensions of the deep sea for a while.

Boom, flash!

With each exertion of the clone’s power, dimensions began to collapse one by one. Dimensions with deep mountains and valleys like a paradise, dimensions of blazing flames, dimensions with black oil flowing, and terrifying dimensions with toxic gases rising.

Kugung, kugugung!

After navigating through dimensions akin to the realm of combined techniques for a while.

Kurrurung!

From within a fragment of a dimension, I sensed a vibration resonating throughout the deep sea. And soon after, the space above the dimension I was destroying with my clone shattered, and a strange creature resembling a catfish roared. It was a deep-sea monster.

I sent the information bodies I controlled with the Zihun Mantian to the clone through the realm of souls.

Kugugugu!

Purple mist rose around the clone.

“Be quiet.”

Tadat!

I flew into the void and split the deep-sea monster in half, then unleashed the power of the Zihun Mantian, which had been struggling to escape my control, onto it.

Shaa!

The purple mist eagerly escaped my control and enveloped the corpse of the deep-sea monster.

‘I can feel it.’

The purple mist began to deconstruct the information of the deep-sea monster. The countless information and knowledge about the history of the deep-sea monster were reconstructed within the purple mist. And in the next moment.

Pasaasa-

The purple mist subsided, and within it, a deep-sea monster in the form of a catfish, now covered in purple, glared at me. The wound I had inflicted was gone.

Kugugugu!

The creature charged at me again. As I roughly attacked it, I realized.

‘It’s stronger than before.’

The Zihun Mantian had entered its body, taking over the deep-sea monster, expelling the bad parts, and concentrating the good parts, resulting in evolution. After dealing with it for a while, I split it in half again.

Boom!

In the place where the deep-sea monster fell, a fist-sized stone remained, and the purple mist floated in the air before attaching itself to the stone.

‘This is….’

Then, the incantation of the Zihun Mantian began to emerge on the stone.

Wuuung-

As I read the incantation of the Zihun Mantian on the stone, I shuddered. The incantation had changed. I recited the changed incantation of the Zihun Mantian and activated it again. And I could tell.

‘The Zihun Mantian has evolved once!’

Although it was just a single line added to the incantation about how to counter a slash, it was still an evolution. A technique that deconstructs and absorbs the opponent’s soul and information to evolve.

‘This is the Zihun Mantian.’

Originally, it was a technique that perfectly assimilated my Yuan Ying with the Zihun Mantian, devouring and evolving by eroding the opponent. However, since I hadn’t fully assimilated my Yuan Ying with the Zihun Mantian, I couldn’t erode the opponent yet.

‘With this, I’ve somewhat obtained the Zihun Mantian.’

“Although it’s a pity that I can’t evolve by eroding the opponent, it’s not what I wanted in the first place, and more importantly, I can move freely in the darkness… I can quickly find Baekrin.”

I smiled and tried to convey the newly acquired power of the Zihun Mantian to the clone on the surface.

And then, I shuddered.

“…Wait.”

Suddenly, a thought occurred to me. The Zihun Mantian is a secret art that deconstructs and absorbs the opponent to erode and evolve. And the Takhun Mantian is a secret art that deconstructs oneself to infect the opponent. If that’s the case, can’t I absorb Seo Hyul’s Takhun Mantian array with the Zihun Mantian?
