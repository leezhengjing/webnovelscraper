The Dead (8)

"Are you crazy, you bastard?" After the Guardian Ghost Kings left, Yeonwi glared at me with eyes blazing with anger. "What are you thinking, suddenly declaring that you won't back down? Ah, is it a plan to use those Guardian Ghost Kings as bait and then we escape? That's not a bad idea. It's a bit regrettable, but it makes sense. Please tell me that's the plan!"

Tss— I released my Ghost King transformation and returned to my human form, Seo Eunhyun.

"Do you know, Elder Yeonwi?"

"What?"

"First Guardian Ghost King Wishon and Second Guardian Ghost King Eumwa are getting married this time."

"So what?"

"The Lord of the Palace has ascended to the position of the 11th Guardian Ghost King and has taken a disciple. His face has been very bright lately."

"..."

"The new puppet instructor who joined recently was very pleased to have reached the Qi Condensation stage. Also, I saw the disciple who joined last time accumulating merits within the sect and being rewarded with a small territory in the Eastern Region, looking very happy. And..."

I continued speaking slowly but with a firm tone.

"This year alone, over 40,000 disciples have joined the sect, and the voices praising our sect are growing louder throughout the entire Baekum Region. In fact, the disciples are actively maintaining public order, so the evil spirits no longer roam freely as they used to. Instead, this place now needs our sect."

"You've completely lost yourself in playing the role of the sect leader! Have you forgotten what our goal was?"

"Yes, I know. To accumulate power. And to find the disciples of the Golden Thunder Sect. And to return."

"Exactly!!! We have already found the whereabouts of the sect's disciples! We don't have time to clean up after the disciples of the Infinite Sect! We need to go find the disciples!"

"I've been thinking deeply about it."

I stood up from the sect leader's seat and approached Yeonwi.

"In the end, whether it's accumulating power, finding the disciples of the Thunder Sect, or returning to the Guanghan Realm, all these goals have one thing in common. Do you know what that is?"

"It's for our benefit!"

"It's to save our 'comrades.'"

Why are we trying to save the disciples of the Golden Thunder Sect? Because they are our comrades. Why are we accumulating power? Because it's necessary to open a path for our return. Why are we trying to return to the Guanghan Realm? Because only by returning can we find a clue to save Kang Minhee.

I have no interest in those to whom I have not given my affection. I smile appropriately and remain indifferent. But once I have given my affection to a comrade, I cannot ignore them.

"The Infinite Sect is already our comrades. Just like the Golden Thunder Sect."

"What nonsense!!! How dare you equate the great Golden Thunder Sect, founded by the ancestors, with this mere cult!!! Jeon Myunghun! Elder Jeon Myunghun! Capture this insolent brat and hang him upside down and beat him severely!"

Yeonwi, her face flushed red, pointed at me furiously. It seemed that equating the Golden Thunder Sect with the Infinite Sect had hurt her pride. However, Jeon Myunghun just shrugged his shoulders.

"If I fight that guy, I'll get beaten up. You know that."

"You insolent brat! How can you, as a great elder of the Golden Thunder Sect, ignore this outrageous situation... Keek!"

Watching Yeonwi's outburst, Jeon Myunghun sighed and then transformed into red lightning, striking the back of Yeonwi's neck. Possessing Yeonjin's body, she fainted immediately.

Buzz— A Taiji symbol emerged from Jeon Myunghun's hand and floated above Yeonwi's upper dantian.

"Separation of soul, reversal."

Flash!

Yeonwi's consciousness, which had been residing in Yeonjin, was expelled and fell into the underworld.

"Please cool your head in the underworld shrine for a while, ancestor."

"Well done. To be honest, it was getting a bit noisy."

"That's true. But you have a point. After all, we've been together for almost 200 years, and it's true that we've grown attached to this place. We also promised to be witnesses at the Guardian Ghost Kings' wedding."

However, Jeon Myunghun looked at me coldly and asked, "But the ancestor's words aren't wrong. What about the sect's disciples whose whereabouts we recently discovered? If we stay here, we won't be able to meet them. And if we go to meet them, the Three Great Forces will invade and destroy our sect. What will you do about that?"

"Don't worry about that. Hongbeom, Kim Yeon."

Two people stepped forward as I called their names. Hongbeom cleared his throat and began explaining something to Jeon Myunghun, showing him a document. Kim Yeon also explained that she had completed everything I had previously requested.

After listening to them, Jeon Myunghun stood still for a while before bursting into laughter.

"Ha, haha... Crazy bastard. Do you think this is possible?"

"Why not?"

"...If this is possible..."

Jeon Myunghun smirked and said, "This sect will become the most famous force in the Netherworld."

"Well, isn't that a good thing? Let's spread the concept of better welfare throughout the entire Netherworld."

"Ha, well... fine."

Jeon Myunghun chuckled for a moment and then turned around.

"Do as you please. If it goes as you say, then indeed... it won't matter if the Three Great Forces come, or if fifty combined forces come. It will also make it easier to rescue the sect's disciples..."

Jeon Myunghun carried the unconscious Yeonjin and left the Infinite Sect's main hall, leaving only me, Kim Yeon, Oh Hyunseok, and Hongbeom inside.

"Hyunseok hyung, do you need anything these days?"

"Not particularly. Just secure some space for me when I ascend to the Astral Stage."

"Yes, I'll prepare it."

"Thanks, then I'll go train."

Oh Hyunseok waved his hand casually and left the basement. Hongbeom, as usual, hid in the shadows and began adjusting the personnel of the Gongryeongji according to my orders. I looked at Kim Yeon.

"And Yeon."

"Yes."

"I heard you destroyed the training ground again this time?"

"Ah, I'm sorry. Lately, I've been having trouble controlling my strength..."

"Controlling your strength..."

I looked at Kim Yeon for a moment and then asked, "Still... have your feelings for me not changed?"

She nodded with clear eyes.

"Yes. They haven't changed. Never!"

"...Alright. You can go now."

Kim Yeon smiled faintly and left the basement. I sighed and sat down on the sect leader's seat. The Netherworld, like the Guanghan Realm, had regions of peace and chaos. And the Baekum Region, where we were, was at the southern end of the Netherworld, while the disciples of the Golden Thunder Sect were reportedly isolated in the chaotic northern region of the Netherworld.

'They are said to be recovering the remains of the rampaging warriors corrupted by the True Man of the Open Flame...'

Crack—

The Black Ghost Bone Palace had assigned such a task to the disciples of the Golden Thunder Sect.

'They must have forced them to investigate a place filled with something akin to radioactive material.'

The remains of the warriors corrupted by the True Man of the Open Flame were said to be extremely dangerous but also of significant value, so the Black Ghost Bone Palace must have wanted them despite the risks. However, they didn't want to risk their own forces, so they pushed the disciples of the Golden Thunder Sect into the dangerous place.

'I need to rescue them quickly.'

If we delay, who knows what might happen.

'But it's almost time.'

The Three Great Forces will soon designate me as a public enemy and come to exterminate me. When that happens, I will shock and confuse everyone and then go to rescue the disciples of the Golden Thunder Sect on the other side of the Netherworld.

Yeonwi thought I acted impulsively, but in fact, I had been planning this ever since I grew attached to the Infinite Sect.

'Of course, in terms of secrecy, Yeonwi's plan was better and less risky, so she would have vehemently opposed it if I had told her in advance.'

Yes, there's no problem so far. But I frowned as I observed Kim Yeon's condition earlier.

"Hongbeom."

"Yes, master."

"How is Yeon's condition recently?"

"...Her abnormal symptoms have worsened."

Hongbeom said with a serious expression.

"I saw her destroy the training ground earlier. She seemed to be in a state of madness, unleashing her power uncontrollably and collapsing the training ground."

"Hmm..."

Recently, Kim Yeon had not been in a normal state. She would spend days in a daze, training martial arts as if in a dream, and at other times, she would go mad and make the puppets dance wildly. The problem was that she didn't remember any of it when she regained her senses. Although there hadn't been any serious damage yet, I noticed a certain madness growing inside her.

'That bastard, the Ghost Lord...'

In this life, the Ghost Lord had been relatively sane and had conversed with me for a long time, even sending Kim Yeon to me in a sane state. He had even crafted a magical artifact imbued with his enlightenment for her. I had assumed that the enlightenment contained in the artifact was the same as what the previous Ghost Lord had passed on to [her] arm, so I hadn't looked into it deeply. But that was a mistake.

'Damn it, that bastard...'

At some point, Kim Yeon began to show an unusual obsession with the 'Mysterious Heart Sutra.' She would mutter things like 'I need to find the last color. I need to name it' with half-closed eyes and recite the sutra's incantations madly. It was clear that the Ghost Lord had deliberately included madness in the artifact along with his enlightenment. When I asked Kim Yeon for the artifact to investigate it again, she had already dismantled it. Apparently, the artifact had to be dismantled to receive the enlightenment of the Mysterious Heart Sutra.

In a normal situation, I would have used the Sealing Spirit Technique or the Mountain of Righteousness to seal her mind. However, when she confessed her unchanged feelings for me, her eyes became clear, and all the madness disappeared. Currently, Kim Yeon was in a state where the mad and sane parts of her mind coexisted. If I tried to seal her mind recklessly, the sane part might be sealed, leaving only the mad part.

'I have to wait until the madness fully manifests or hope that Kim Yeon overcomes it herself.'

"...Did you say that Kim Yeon destroyed the training ground with just her martial arts? The training ground that Yeonwi, I, and Kim Yeon combined our strength to set up?"

"Yes. Even without using Heavenly Qi Induction to gather the energy of heaven and earth, her power suddenly amplified greatly."

"..."

I recalled the look in her eyes when she confessed her feelings. Those clear eyes. I remembered what lay beyond those eyes. When she had those eyes, I saw her mind integrating, even if only for a moment.

'Perhaps... if she overcomes this madness, she might reach the Moon Path.'

Although she aimed for the Pinnacle of the Peak, the Sim Clan didn't go through the Pinnacle of the Peak stage when awakening their manifestation, so theoretically, it wasn't impossible.

'Overcome it, Yeon.'

Currently, Kim Yeon was like a child left in a forest. The forest was filled with bandits wielding knives, making it a very precarious situation. However, she held an M16 rifle in her hands, fully loaded, and set to automatic fire. If the conditions were right, she could become incredibly formidable. She just needed to pull the trigger herself to eliminate the danger.

'It's already in your hands, Kim Yeon.'

I had been trying to draw out her power through martial arts guidance, but it was still worrisome. However, if she managed to awaken her abilities, she would grow brilliantly.

"Still, I have checked all the formations that Kim Yeon set up throughout the Baekum Region. There will be no interference with the grand plan."

"...Alright. That's enough."

I reclined in the sect leader's seat and closed my eyes. In my vast consciousness, I sensed Eumwa and Wishon preparing for their wedding in one part of the Infinite Sect.

'The short peace is coming to an end. Soon, many powerful figures from the Three Great Forces will arrive.'

There is no fear.

"Be ready to activate 'that' at any time. Hongbeom."

"Yes, master."

* * *

The Baekum Region was now almost entirely swallowed by the Infinite Sect. Branches of the Infinite Sect were established throughout the Baekum Region, and over 90% of the sentient beings in the region were disciples of the Infinite Sect. Through the relay formations set up in the branches, news from the Infinite Sect's headquarters spread throughout the entire sect.

"Did you hear about it?"

"About the First Guardian Ghost King's wedding?"

"Yes. I heard the Second Guardian Ghost King is the bride."

"Well, they were a perfect match even before joining the Infinite Sect. They couldn't be together because they had to take responsibility for their respective sects, but now that they're free from that, they're finally tying the knot."

"Haha, it feels so refreshing."

The wedding of the First Guardian Ghost King Wishon and the Second Guardian Ghost King Eumwa was the talk of the entire Baekum Region. The whole region was excited about the news of the two spirits finally coming together after hundreds of years.

In front of the Infinite Sect's main hall, the Infinite Sect's headquarters, two spirits were about to be united. Jeon Myunghun, following the traditions of the Baekum Region, covered his entire body with dark ghost energy and presided over the wedding with an eerie voice.

"I swear."

Wishon, who had transformed into a handsome form using the circuits of his puppet body, nodded with a flushed face, wearing the traditional attire of the Baekum Region.

"I swear."

Eumwa, in a beautiful puppet body, wearing traditional attire, looked at Wishon with a blushing face.

The two spirits nodded simultaneously and shouted.

"I swear!"

Rumble!

Jeon Myunghun scattered the curse techniques included in the Six Extreme Thunder God into the air. An eerie ghostly wail echoed in the air, and the numerous ghosts attending the wedding screamed in joy. Many ghosts laughed, some in cursed dolls clattered with laughter, and a ghostly feast was held in front of the Infinite Sect's main hall.

Since it was the wedding of two Guardian Ghost Kings, the sect's executives, including Jeon Myunghun, Oh Hyunseok, Kim Yeon, and Yeonjin, attended to congratulate them. Among them, Kim Yeon was in charge of recording the wedding with a video technique.

Buzz—

Kim Yeon frowned as she recorded the event.

'Something's wrong.'

Recently, she had been feeling overly emotional and strange at times. However, there hadn't been any major issues, and Seo Eunhyun had encouraged her, saying that such phenomena would disappear as she reached higher levels of martial arts. But as she watched the two happy lovers getting married, she felt something welling up inside her chest.

Especially the wedding vows recited by Jeon Myunghun, which were customary in any dimension or realm.

—Do you swear to become each other's wings and roots?

When she heard those words, she felt a strange scene appear before her eyes.

—Look, Yeon. This is the Winged Spear.

It was a strange scene. A woman was dancing with short spears in both hands. It was a dance very similar to the Winged Dance that Seo Eunhyun had taught her.

Throb—

'No...'

Kim Yeon shook her head, feeling as if she was becoming someone else while watching that scene.

'This isn't me.'

Throb, throb...

She looked back on her past, reaffirming her identity. She often felt as if she was becoming someone else, so she would look back on her past to reaffirm her identity.

'I need to grow even more, quickly.'

She was obsessed with mastering the Mysterious Heart Sutra even more, her eyes shining with determination.

And the wedding of Eumwa and Wishon came to an end.

"Finally, we're together, Eumwa."

"It was something we couldn't even imagine before."

Eumwa looked at Wishon with loving eyes and smiled.

"...It would have been nice if Baekrin could have blessed us too."

"...Indeed. If I hadn't helped Baekrin escape back then, we could all be happy together."

"Sigh, thinking about that guy always makes my heart ache. I want to be happy with him too.... Ah, thank you for recording this, Mysterious Ghost King."

Wishon took the recording device from Kim Yeon and fell into thought. Eumwa, seeing Wishon like that, made a bitter expression but then clapped her hands as if she had a good idea.

"Oh, I have a good idea."

"What is it, Eumwa?"

"Well..."

* * *

In the territory of the Black Ghost Bone Palace, in the Ghostly Region. In the branch of the Black Ghost Bone Palace. Next to the eerie Ghostly Abyss, in the mountain range. There was someone's territory. It was Baekrin's territory.

Rumble—

Inside the territory. Baekrin absorbed the ghost energy emanating from the Ghostly Abyss, his eyes glowing with ghostly light. His cultivation, which had fallen due to using the White Bone Shedding Technique, was returning.

He smiled with satisfaction. He clenched his fist with a hopeful voice. And as he was solidifying his hope, he turned his head towards something knocking on the barrier in front of his territory.

Buzz—

With a gesture, he brought the object that had reached the barrier in front of him. That day, a recording device arrived in front of Baekrin.
