From the Sea (2)

"10,000 years later...!"

I gasped. Although 10,000 years seemed like a long time, for cultivators beyond the Sacrificial Stage, it wasn't that long.

"Why is the apocalypse happening?"

"Hmm, I don't know the details... but from what I've heard, when the gravitational force of the Celestial Region reaches its peak, the star system contracts, leading to the apocalypse."

"What?"

"The Sage calls it the Great Collapse or the Great Contraction. My nickname and techniques are derived from it."

According to Zhang Yi, the Celestial Region we were in seemed to be continuously expanding, but at some point, it would start contracting and eventually return to a single point of origin.

"I don't know the exact reason why this happens. And from what I know, even if the Great Contraction occurs, the Middle Realm will never be destroyed."

"The Middle Realm won't be destroyed?"

"Yes. However, according to the Sage, when the Great Contraction occurs and the apocalypse arrives, even if the Middle Realm remains intact, this Celestial Region will be filled with intense heat and light, making it an uninhabitable environment for any living being. Everything will turn into primordial light and vanish. Unless one is at the Quasi-Saint level, they won't be able to resist and will perish. Even the Sages who have merged with the Middle Realm might not survive; it's truly terrifying."

I shuddered at the horrifying truth.

'So, I need to grow strong enough to withstand the apocalypse within 10,000 years.'

However, I wasn't sure if I could reach the Sacrificial Stage even after 10,000 years.

"...I understand about the apocalypse. Then, may I ask one last question?"

"Go ahead."

"I've heard that to enter the next stage, one must sever all ties."

"That's correct. Oh, have you grasped the clue to the next stage?"

"No, I just heard about it."

"That's also a skill. Well... yes, if you want to enter the same realm as me, you must sever all ties."

I asked with a serious look.

"How do you sever them?"

Zhang Yi seemed to understand what I was trying to say by looking at my intent.

"I see. You can't sever them, can you?"

"Yes. In fact, the reason I tried to send an avatar to the Thunder Sound Sea, where the Sages reside, while crossing the middle regions of the High Realm was because of this."

I revealed my true intentions without hesitation.

"I came to ask if there is an external method to reach that realm without severing ties, or if one truly must sever everything to reach that realm."

"Hmm..."

Zhang Yi stroked his chin and spoke.

"First, let me tell you the difference between the general Sacrificial Stage and my realm. Those in the Sacrificial Stage find ties and emotions meaningless after reaching that stage. On the other hand, I had to sever such things to reach this realm."

I pondered the difference between the two.

'In the Sacrificial Stage, it doesn't matter if you have emotions or ties when you advance, but they naturally disappear after reaching the stage. In this realm beyond the Seated Meditation, you must sever ties and emotions to cross over.'

However, I felt something strange and asked.

"But doesn't the Sage of the Contraction have emotions?"

"How do you know if I have emotions or not? Are you saying you can read my intent?"

He smirked and took a bite of a golden apple he had thrown into the bonfire. 

Crunch—

For some reason, although it was an apple, it oozed meat juice instead of fruit juice. The apple emitted a protein scent.

Zhang Yi tore into the apple-like meat and met my gaze. His mouth moved greedily, but his eyes were cold and empty.

Indeed, it was very difficult to read Zhang Yi's intent. His intent seemed so hollow, blurry, and doubtful if it even existed. From the perspective of those who had reached the Three Flowers Gathering, Zhang Yi seemed like a sophisticated meat puppet rather than a living being.

Swoosh!

While I was staring at him, I felt as if I was being sucked into his empty eyes. When I came to my senses, I found myself in a cosmic space where all the stars shone green.

It was an illusion caused by Zhang Yi's pressure.

Rumble—

My mind felt like it was being crushed. Feeling terrified, I looked up and saw a green nebula taking the shape of Zhang Yi's face, looking down at me.

'This is... the magnitude of the Sage of the Contraction's mind...'

It wasn't just about the size of his divine sense. The intent he had pushed forward all his life was that enormous.

'Is he going to cook my brain...'

I couldn't regain my senses under that pressure. However, I knew one thing. Zhang Yi had emotions! And he cherished his ties!

"I once heard something from someone."

I opened my mouth, not yielding to his pressure.

"After hearing someone mock the mind as merely a metallic function, I conveyed that mockery to someone else, and this was their response."

The words Zhang Yi had said to Xu Lian when Xu Lian mocked Seo Hyul's mind.

"If the mind is metal, then in the classification of cultivators, metal corresponds to Heaven (Qian), meaning the mind is as eternal as the sky."

I recited Zhang Yi's words from my previous life in front of him in this life and shouted.

"Isn't that right, Sage? The human mind can never be eradicated, can it?"

As I shouted and refined my consciousness, I found myself back in front of the bonfire, free from Zhang Yi's pressure.

"This... is something."

Zhang Yi looked at me, crossed his arms, and laughed.

"That's right. Emotions can never be eradicated. That's why even Sages have emotions, greed, and fear. Although I said that other Sages lose their ties and emotions, they haven't truly disappeared. It's just a difference in perspective..."

"...! So, does that mean the way to reach the next realm is not to discard the mind and emotions but to properly acknowledge and refine them!?"

"Eh... no."

He bit into the golden apple as if wondering what I was talking about.

"You must eradicate what cannot be eradicated. Do you understand? To reach this realm, you must do so."

"Then how do you eradicate what cannot be eradicated?"

"I told you. You can't."

He laughed, saying something incomprehensible.

"You must be able to eradicate what cannot be eradicated to enter this realm. So how do you eradicate what cannot be eradicated? Finding that will be your future cultivation method."

"......"

"Strictly speaking, although I said I would take you as my disciple, there's not much I can teach you. As someone who has gone ahead, I can only give you advice. Each of our Heart Clan members is entirely different."

He pointed somewhere and spoke.

"When you entered the Thunder Sound Sea, you must have fallen into a region where you couldn't use prayer rituals, right?"

"Yes."

"How did you get out?"

"I raised the Total Heaven Sword to the level of a name and cut through space to escape."

"When I first arrived there, I stimulated my body to extend my sensing range, drew in the qi from outside that space, and shattered it to escape. As you can see, even in escaping a single place, our methods differ. I could recite my enlightenment to you, but it wouldn't suit you and wouldn't help."

Swoosh—

Zhang Yi stood up and spoke.

"That's why, although I have disciples in a master-disciple relationship, there are no true successors among them. All I can do is assign training tasks that seem suitable for my disciples."

I listened to his words with a serious expression.

"Then I will now assign you a training task. This is your first training task."

He smirked and spoke.

"Go outside the Thunder Sound Sea and cut down a star. You can use the power of your Celestial and Earth Clans, treasures, or even the help of others. Use any means to destroy a star. Oh, and I mean a star without any living beings. Don't go attacking innocent planets and destroying civilizations."

Whoosh!

He swung his saber, and the light from Zhang Yi's saber pierced my soul and embedded itself in my mind.

Crack!

As before, Zhang Yi's saber was now positioned on one side of my sword mountain.

Flash!

With a wave of Zhang Yi's arm, I was suddenly propelled far from the bonfire, passing through countless spacetime.

Swoosh!

Countless scenes flashed past me, and I soon arrived in a star system illuminated by countless starlight.

Rumble!

And in front of me, where I had emerged, was a massive decayed star system shrouded in a dimensional barrier.

'That is the remains of Yang Sujin.'

The decayed star system took the form of a giant ring finger, each joint almost the size of Earth. Judging by its shape, it seemed to be the left ring finger.

'Is Yang Sujin's treasure a ring?'

The inside of the ring finger-shaped decayed star system was hollowed out in a circular shape. It was the mark of a ring that had been worn for a long time.

The ring finger, called the Thunder Sound Sea, was said to be the entrance to the space where his treasure was located. So, if I reached another space through the Thunder Sound Sea, I might find a giant ring.

'But cutting down a star...'

Contrary to my expectation of being beaten by Zhang Yi, it seemed his training method was to give tasks without much interference.

'A star...'

I recalled Zhang Yi splitting a planet in half.

'With my current power... even if I use the Three-Tai Chi, I can only plow the surface of a planet and leave a crack...'

That was my limit. It was also the limit of a typical Great Unity cultivator.

'If I combine the cultivation of the Seated Meditation and the Celestial and Earth Clans to the level of a Great Unity cultivator... and borrow the power of treasures and formations...'

It seemed somewhat possible.

I thought I understood what Zhang Yi meant.

'He wants me to raise my cultivation as much as possible and then return.'

After all, although I was mimicking the Great Unity cultivator with the early Seated Meditation and the size of the Celestial and Earth Clans, my actual realm was the Sacrificial Stage.

'Okay, let's go back and raise my realm as much as possible before returning.'

With that decision, I sought out my avatar, Ham Jin.

Buzz!

Since I had crossed into the star system through Ham Jin, we were connected, making it easy to find him.

Flash!

Ham Jin had fallen on a star near the Thunder Sound Sea where living beings could survive. He had established a primitive tribal nation on one side of the star's continent and was actively working to proliferate descendants as the great chieftain of the tribe.

"...Ham Jin."

"Huff, huff... huh!"

Sensing my presence, he came out of his stone house to greet me.

"Great King of the Infinite, have you come? I have been spreading the teachings of the Infinite Sect here for you! I have also promulgated the Infinite King Ritual to honor you!"

"...Phew, well done. Thanks to you, it will be easier when I return. Let's go back now."

"Ah... actually, I have made 13 wives here, but I have only given love to three of them. Can I give love to all of them equally before we leave...?"

I chuckled at his absurdity and spoke.

"Reach the Sacrificial Stage and come back later."

"Ah, understood. Then, may I say goodbye to my wives..."

After speaking to the chieftains, he received bows from dozens of chieftains and wives, then came to me with numerous gifts of the star's spiritual stones, specialties, and strange items. He seemed a bit melancholic.

"...No one is stopping me. They all said they liked me so much, but when I said I was leaving, they welcomed it with open arms and even bowed to send me off... how heartless. Home is the best. I want to see my wives back home."

"...Shut up. Let's go."

I entered Ham Jin's body.

"That person named Zhang Yi told me that the star with the High Realm transmission array is that one."

"Yes."

I descended onto the star with the middle region of the High Realm.

'They said the worlds with the middle regions are all parts of a True Person's body.'

In other words, this star was also a True Person.

'And... the world where Ham Jin is also a True Person disguised as a decayed star system.'

I had wondered how the world remained intact despite the battles of the Sacrificial Stage cultivators, but it seemed there was no problem because it was the body of a True Person.

'Zhang Yi told Ham Jin the location of the middle region of the High Realm, meaning he wanted me to use it. And if he told me to use it, it means the True Person who tried to capture us is now asleep again.'

In other words, there was no problem in returning.

Buzz!

I began to cross countless spacetime with Ham Jin once again.
