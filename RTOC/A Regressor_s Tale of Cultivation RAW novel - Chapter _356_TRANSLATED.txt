The Axis of the Earth (地軸) gathered a lifespan of 10,000 years. Over the past years, I performed sacrificial rituals across the lower realms to accumulate this lifespan. Through these rituals, I gathered 7,000 years of lifespan, and I took 3,000 years from my own lifespan to make it a total of 10,000 years. Now, the only thing left is to completely compress this accumulation and make it mine, and then perform the ritual to announce to the Netherworld that I have obtained this accumulation.

Uuuung―

In the darkness, I formed an altar and looked at the pillar of light that appeared before me. A pillar created by the gathered lifespan of 10,000 years. If I refine this pillar one more time, the accumulation will be complete. But why? As I looked at this pillar, something seemed to bother me.

'Why?'

It's not that I'm taking the lifespan of the living beings of the lower realms anymore. It's not that I lack the power to save my comrades. And it's not the time to hesitate here. Even at this moment, my comrades are doing their best to protect the Guangyin Territory outside. So why am I hesitating here?

'Have I not put in enough effort?'

That wasn't it either. I always received the minimum compensation while giving the maximum benefit. And when I tore off the remaining 3,000 years of my lifespan to build the axis, I had to endure hellish pain. Tearing off my lifespan was extremely painful and a form of penance.

'Then why?'

Why am I hesitating at the last moment?

"...Hoo."

I took a deep breath. And then, without hesitation, I began the compression ritual. Now, all that's left is to announce to the Netherworld that I have completed this accumulation! There's no more time to waste!

Fwoooosh!

Blue ghost flames ignited in the twelve directions around the accumulation.

"The Axis of the Earth ritual begins!"

Uuuung!

I raised my hand to take the first step towards truly ascending to the Axis of the Earth. The Axis of the Earth. Why must the first stage of the Middle Realm be the Axis of the Earth and not the Axis of the Four Directions? The Axis of the Earth means the axis of a star. The north and south of a star. End to end. The center connecting the poles! That is the Axis of the Earth. So, what else would you call this stage of accumulating the gravitational force that connects people to people and the world to me?

'Or... did I come up with that logic?'

Thinking back, it wasn't that I thought of it that way and named the Axis of the Four Directions as the Axis of the Earth. Suddenly, the 'name' was 'engraved' in my mind.

'...What is this?'

I didn't quite understand, but I started the Axis of the Earth ritual as it was. It's similar to the Seven Stars ritual. However, unlike the Seven Stars ritual, there's no need to perform the ritual towards the sky; it just needs to be done in a place where the flow of the dragon veins is smooth. Centering on the axis of numbers, infusing the energy of the Netherworld symbolizing the twelve hours into the accumulation one by one, and it's done.

At that moment.

"...!"

I suddenly looked at the ceiling of the basement. Up there.

'What... a celestial phenomenon? No... this is...!'

* * *

Jeon Myeonghun became a storm. Around him, thunderclouds gathered densely, scattering countless bolts of lightning rain in all directions. The high-level ghost creatures screamed and retreated, and the 'believers' who were eroded by the True Men also recoiled in fear at Jeon Myeonghun's thunder spear, which was like a heavenly calamity.

Crackle!

Jeon Myeonghun dominated the battlefield with his thunder spear. At that moment, he was the king of this place.

Crackle!

Red lightning raged. It swept in all directions. It stormed like a tempest. It pierced like an awl. It burned like a flame. Every time Jeon Myeonghun moved his six arms, the battlefield seemed to become a sea of red lightning.

Crackle!

However, Jeon Myeonghun's expression gradually darkened.

'I'm starting to feel the strain.'

The red thunder he was emitting was a transformed heavenly calamity. He was using the heavenly calamity to fight his enemies, and the heavenly calamity was gradually getting stronger, judging that Jeon Myeonghun was 'receiving help from others.' The heavenly calamity was both a panacea and a treasure for Jeon Myeonghun, so it didn't matter if it got stronger to some extent. However, he could feel it. The heavenly calamity in his hand was getting heavier and thicker. And it was getting hotter to the point where Jeon Myeonghun could hardly handle it.

'I can't keep this up.'

Eventually, the heavenly calamity would become so berserk that even Jeon Myeonghun wouldn't be able to control it and would instead attack him. Of course, Jeon Myeonghun wouldn't be harmed by the heavenly calamity, but if it got that strong, absorbing it could cause his dantian to explode.

Rumble!

He thundered, sweating coldly inside.

'Damn it, just hold on a little longer, Jeon Myeonghun!'

He pushed himself, swinging the heavenly calamity and dancing. But gradually, the heavenly calamity in his hand became too hot, and Jeon Myeonghun finally gave up handling it.

Crackle!

The heavenly calamity in Jeon Myeonghun's hand shone brightly and left his hand. And then, the heavenly calamity began to envelop Jeon Myeonghun and enter his body. His lifespan, his cultivation, began to surge madly.

Rumble!

Jeon Myeonghun's body grew even larger. And at some point!

Rumble!

Jeon Myeonghun's body became the thundercloud itself. As the giant made of thunderclouds roared, the entire vicinity echoed loudly.

Rumble!

And then, a semi-transparent barrier formed around Jeon Myeonghun and spread out. The barrier grew crazily in size, covering the entire Guangyin Territory. The ghost kings of the four great forces who saw this burst into laughter.

"...He's gone mad. How can he ascend to the fusion stage in the middle of a battle...?"

Jeon Myeonghun had finally completed the process of merging heaven and earth and reached the fusion stage.

Rumble!

Jeon Myeonghun's voice echoed from within his domain, spreading in all directions. The eyes of those watching him were filled with tension.

"He was already formidable in the Axis of the Four Directions stage, but how strong has he become in the fusion stage...?"

"As expected of the Great Protector of the Demonic Sect...!"

But contrary to their concerns, Jeon Myeonghun was filled with tension.

'I've reached the fusion stage, but my power is much weaker than when I received the upgraded heavenly calamity.'

The moment he was strongest was when he received the upgraded heavenly calamity. In fact, the moment he reached the fusion stage was much weaker than when he received the heavenly calamity.

'Will bluffs work?'

And then, it happened. The 96 ghost kings who had been attacking Jeon Myeonghun and the Guangyin Territory retreated. Jeon Myeonghun's eyes lit up.

'Did it work?'

And at that moment. A voice transmission came from Seo Eunhyun, who was supposed to be in closed-door training. And then.

Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump!

The seven believers who had been attacking with the fusion stage ghost kings rushed towards the Guangyin Territory instead of retreating like the ghost kings.

Rumble!

The seven believers, each with multiple heads, reached out their hands and limbs towards the sky. And then, light descended from the sky, connecting the believers and the True Men.

'I must... stop them...!'

Rumble, rumble!

But before Jeon Myeonghun could move. Dark clouds gathered in the sky again, blocking the True Men's view. The believers who were trying to borrow power from the True Men were disconnected from them. Jeon Myeonghun smiled at the sight.

Rumble!

A ghost king with 19 heads flew to the side of the giant made of thunderclouds. The giant made of thunderclouds formed a hand seal and pointed to the sky. As Seo Eunhyun accumulated the compression, the dark clouds that had been writhing as if they would drop the twin-colored heavenly calamity at any moment couldn't drop the heavenly calamity. Jeon Myeonghun sighed slightly. Currently, Seo Eunhyun had accumulated two axes of blessings. And according to Yeonwi, three axes of blessings were needed to open the shortcut. Of course, if Jeon Myeonghun, who had reached the fusion stage, joined forces with Seo Eunhyun, it could be considered as having three axes of blessings, and they could open the shortcut. But the problem was that if Jeon Myeonghun focused on opening the shortcut with Seo Eunhyun, there would inevitably be a gap in their defenses.

At Jeon Myeonghun's question, Seo Eunhyun looked back. All the followers of the Guangyin Territory who followed him came out and looked up at Seo Eunhyun, who had finished his closed-door training. Jeon Myeonghun, other comrades, guardian ghost kings, and guests like Yoo Hye were all looking at him. Seo Eunhyun smiled.

Uuuung!

Gravitational force began to emerge from his body. Jeon Myeonghun was startled by the sight. Seo Eunhyun chuckled and clicked his tongue, while Jeon Myeonghun got angry instead. Seo Eunhyun nodded towards Jeon Myeonghun with a reliable look in his 38 eyes. Seo Eunhyun flew towards the direction of the Mugeuk Sect and began to form a hand seal. And then.

Rumble!

The dark clouds in the sky, which had been temporarily sealed by Jeon Myeonghun and contained the heavenly calamity, began to clear. The next moment.

Ziiing―

A massive [Will] began to descend to the ground.

―In the name of the True Men, we have agreed. All heavenly punishments occurring in the Netherworld at this moment shall be postponed for one year. Clouds that bring the heavenly calamity, disperse.

Ziiing―

The will of the True Men echoed across the battlefield. The dark clouds created by Seo Eunhyun's ascension dispersed so easily, and the will of the True Men descended to the ground again.

Rumble!

Starlight fell upon the seven believers. The believers began to scream in pain. Among those anxiously watching the battlefield behind Seo Eunhyun, Yoo Hye's eyes wavered as she looked at them.

"Wait! Lord Chajo...!?"

She shouted as she looked at one of the believers, who was in pain from receiving the light of the True Men.

"Lord Chajo! Why are you there! Lord Chajo!"

But the believer who had transformed from Chajo didn't seem to hear her. He just muttered as he received the light from the sky. The 96 fusion stage ghost kings behind the seven believers gathered in groups of twelve and began to form hand seals behind the believers.

Uung, uung, uuuung―

The fusion stage ghost kings expanded their domains. Their domains, which were like dimensional barriers, buzzed and extended towards the sky. And those pillars of light reached the ends of the light falling on the seven believers. The ghost kings' gravitational force was projected towards the sky. Finally, a crack appeared in the sky.

Crack!

It didn't seem like much had changed. The dark sky of the Netherworld still had stars, and the stars were still looking down on the ground. The only change was the transparent 'crack' in the sky. However, through that crack, [Power] from [Above] began to pour down.

――――――!

With an unknown cry, the seven believers simultaneously pointed their fingers towards the Guangyin Territory. The next moment.

Rumble!

An irresistible weight fell upon the entire Guangyin Territory.

Boom! Crackle!

The domain created by the six-pole ghost king Jeon Myeonghun was shattered. Jeon Myeonghun didn't die, but he was left lying on the ground, unable to make a sound, in a prostrated position. Seo Eunhyun, who was trying to open the 'shortcut' above the Mugeuk Sect, was also slammed to the ground. Although Seo Eunhyun wasn't in a prostrated position like Jeon Myeonghun, he was also stuck to the ground, unable to do anything. The gravitational force was getting stronger and stronger.

Clatter, clatter, clatter!

The cursed dolls, which were the physical bodies of the ghost creatures in the Guangyin Territory, all began to emit white steam and break down. The True Men were trying to annihilate the Mugeuk Sect.

* * *

'This is insane...'

The pressure was immense. At this rate, not only the Mugeuk Sect but the entire Guangyin Territory would be crushed into a handful of dust.

Rumble!

Enduring the pressure falling on me, I gathered all the gravitational force I had been using to create the shortcut and stood against the power falling on the Guangyin Territory. Thanks to that, the followers and Jeon Myeonghun were somewhat freed from the pressure, but the area of pressure I was receiving increased, making me feel like my entire body was about to burst.

"Don't... be... ridiculous...!"

I shouted with my voice, unable to use my spiritual speech. The momentum seemed to want to crush me here without giving me a chance to open the shortcut. Previously, it seemed like there were two options: expulsion or annihilation. But in reality, it seemed like the main opinion was to annihilate us.

"Ugh...!"

But frustratingly, I didn't have the power to stop this. I could feel it. This overwhelming cosmic power was being exerted by the True Men in a 'wounded state.' Moreover, it wasn't even their true power; they were just pouring their power indirectly through the believers. They were afraid of seeing the [Inverse Horn] from me again if they used their power directly. However, even with this slight and indirect power, we were on the verge of death. I shouted towards the sky in frustration.

"True Men! What have we done so wrong!"

But there was no answer. However, I somehow understood. Bugs. To them, we were no different from bugs. They wouldn't bother to explain things to bugs. Right. The reason they were doing this was obvious. It wasn't because they found me disgusting or were angry about me showing them the [Inverse Horn]. They just felt that the being they mistakenly thought was behind me was ignoring and opposing them, so they were venting their anger on me, whom they thought was a pawn of that being.

'Ridiculous.'

Such a being doesn't even exist. How many times have I been mocked and ridiculed like this? It was frustrating and infuriating, but there was nothing I could do. I could only be crushed little by little by the power of the True Men. 'Is this the end...?' I could tell. Being crushed to death by the will of the True Men was the conclusion of this cycle. There was no other ending.

'So this is... our end...'

I closed my eyes. And I accepted death. 'If I'm going to die like this...' I began to dismantle the accumulation I had just successfully completed. 'I'll return it.' Tsu-tsu-tsu-tsu-tsu― The lifespan I had received from the beings of the lower realms as the Mugeuk Ghost King over the years. I sensed the gravitational force connected to them through that lifespan. 'I'll return it.' Through the gravitational force, I tore apart my accumulation and returned it. Through the spiritual realm, countless lights poured down. The lifespans used in my accumulation returned to their original owners. Since I was going to die anyway, I decided to do what I could. Since it wasn't mine, it was better to return it.

Tsu-tsu-tsu-tsu―

And at that moment. I heard a voice whispering in my ear.

―Isn't it a waste? After all, it was a fair trade. In the end, you used your time and power and got nothing in return. Isn't it meaningless?

Was it my inner demon? My remaining desire? It didn't matter. The answer was already decided.

"There was nothing from the beginning."

Life is just a series of failures and emptiness. Just adding another speck of meaninglessness to the mountain of countless failures and meaninglessness.

"If I came with an empty body, I should leave with an empty body."

I decided to use my last bit of strength to feed the heavenly calamity. But at that moment.

―Excellent.

The voice I thought was my inner demon or desire laughed. Chills ran down my spine!

'What is this?'

The next moment, I screamed in agony as I felt a crazy pain in my chest.

"Aaahhh!"

It hurts! It hurts so much!!!

Crack, crackle!

My lifespan was being torn apart! When I ascended to the Axis of the Four Directions, I received a lifespan of 10,000 years from the heavens. And I used 3,000 years of that lifespan to build the accumulation, leaving me with about 10,000 years of lifespan, including the lifespan I gained during my cultivation in the Small Realm. However, [someone] tore apart my remaining lifespan. In an instant, 7,000 years of my lifespan were torn away. I had experienced the pain of tearing off my lifespan several times, but the pain of having my lifespan torn away so brutally was something I could never get used to. The pain coming from the depths of my soul made it impossible for me to stay conscious. But at that moment, [someone] infused the 3,000 years of lifespan they tore from me into the remaining accumulation.

Uuuung!

The accumulation, which had been reduced to 30% after returning it to the beings of the lower realms, was completed again to 100%. But at that moment. I felt like I understood something.

―Cultivation (修仙) is about 'taking.'

Taking from the demonic path, taking from the righteous path, taking from the monsters, taking from the enemies to elevate oneself. That is cultivation! Take from anyone who stands in the way of your will, whether they are demons, enemies, or even comrades, and even if they are your betrothed with whom you have a thousand-year promise, take from them to complete yourself. That is cultivation!

'Why' did I hesitate before completing the accumulation just now? 'Why' did I feel uneasy about the accumulation? Yes, it was probably because the way of building the Axis of Blessings was close to the demonic path, which easily plundered others. But now. 'With only my pure lifespan,' I built the accumulation. Now I understood 'why' I felt uneasy.

I looked at the illusion of Yeonwi in front of me. No, it was the illusion of the Golden Thunder Sect that taught Yeonwi, and soon it
