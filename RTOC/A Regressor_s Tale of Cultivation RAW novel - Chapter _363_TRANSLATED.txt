### A Friend from Afar Brings Joy (6)

The man stroking his hand, Jin Mayeol, frowned as he faced Jeon Myeonghun, the Grand Protector of the Muguk Sect. There was a subtle force emanating from the man before him.

‘A Fusion Stage cultivator, huh.’

However, Jin Mayeol was not worried.

‘Judging by his lack of control over his domain, he must have only recently reached the Fusion Stage. Nothing to worry about.’

Srrrng—

He drew out his true name artifact, the Yeolhaswaegeom (裂罅鎖鎌), and enveloped himself in his domain. 

Chwarang, chwararang!

Holding the black chain sickle inscribed with jade-colored runes, he chanted an incantation, causing his form to become semi-transparent. His domain overlapped with the void, allowing him to use stealth at any moment and divert his opponent’s attacks elsewhere.

Jin Mayeol hurled his Yeolhaswaegeom at Jeon Myeonghun.

‘Newbies at the initial Fusion Stage lose their composure if you crack their domain!’

Just as the Yeolhaswaegeom, flying at the speed of light, was about to reach Jeon Myeonghun...

“…!”

Crack!

Jin Mayeol sensed something was wrong.

‘This is... the sky? Why am I flying? And...’

Before he could finish his thought, a six-armed giant with lightning coursing through its body appeared above him. In its hand was a seven-colored thunderbolt.

“Wait...”

Crack!

Jin Mayeol was slammed into the ground, coughing up blood.

‘Something’s wrong!’

Boom!

“Ugh...!”

As soon as he regained his senses, he rolled away to avoid Jeon Myeonghun, who was descending from above.

Boom!

Jeon Myeonghun struck the ground with his six arms, and Jin Mayeol retreated, moving his chain sickle. But then...

Rumble!

“What...!”

The ground suddenly tilted. Through his domain, Jin Mayeol realized what was happening.

‘The Sky Map of the Demonic Beasts has split in half!’

Rumble!

He sensed ‘something’ clashing at an incredible speed behind him. Gritting his teeth, he caught glimpses of a golden light.

‘It’s him! The thief who stole my true name artifact last time!’

He could never forget that terrifying speed. The companion of the Conqueror King who had stolen his cherished Yookdo (毓刀) Blood Fruit!

Glancing at the ‘something’ fighting the thief at an equal speed, he thought,

‘If that thief is fighting equally, he must have drawn my stolen artifact. I must seize the opportunity to reclaim my true name artifact.’

Just as he finished his thought, a crimson thunderbolt flew towards him.

Boom!

An explosion occurred in an instant. Jeon Myeonghun, startled, glared at Jin Mayeol, who had blocked his thunderbolt. In Jin Mayeol’s right hand was his Yeolhaswaegeom, and in his left hand, a grotesque sword formed from his bones, flesh, and muscles.

“Sorry about that. I thought you were just at the initial Fusion Stage, but it seems you’ve mastered a rather unique technique, making you at least mid to late stage...”

Jin Mayeol grinned.

“I’ll take you seriously.”

Rumble!

An overwhelming aura emanated from his entire body. For a brief moment, Jeon Myeonghun felt the same chilling sensation he had once felt from Seo Eunhyun.

“Dubu (鬪步), Second Realm.”

The grotesque sword in his hand was overlaid with his domain. In the next moment, Jin Mayeol folded space and rushed right in front of Jeon Myeonghun.

Crack!

Jeon Myeonghun’s thunder spear clashed with Jin Mayeol’s grotesque sword, causing an explosion. Jeon Myeonghun looked at his tingling hand.

“It’s a type of combat dance learned in the traditional rituals of the Bondu aristocracy. Once you reach a certain level...”

Boom!

Jin Mayeol rushed at Jeon Myeonghun again, swinging his grotesque sword. Jeon Myeonghun defended with his thunder spear, but the grotesque sword twisted grotesquely like Seo Eunhyun’s invisible sword, scratching Jeon Myeonghun’s body.

Jeon Myeonghun frowned. His eyes, moving with the speed of lightning, could see the trajectory of Jin Mayeol’s sword. The sword moved as if alive, connected to his body, changing ‘every moment’ in the air. It read every air current, making the best choice every moment.

Jeon Myeonghun gritted his teeth in frustration.

“Haha, so what...”

Crack, crack!

The seven-colored thunderbolt swirling around Jeon Myeonghun’s six arms began to unify into one color. A crimson thunderbolt!

Jin Mayeol sensed something was wrong.

Crack!

As Jeon Myeonghun extended his six arms, thunder spears were fired in all directions.

Boom!

The crimson thunderbolt wriggled, chasing Jin Mayeol.

Crack!

One of the thunder spears finally embedded itself in Jin Mayeol’s torso, causing him to foam at the mouth in excruciating pain.

‘Damn, I need to get out of his attack range!’

Taat!

Jin Mayeol hurriedly escaped the Guangyin Domain. Having faced the Conqueror King’s fleet a few times, he judged it better to face Jeon Myeonghun near the Northern Fleet’s sea domain.

But soon, he realized his judgment was wrong.

Crack!

Jeon Myeonghun’s body swelled even more. An enormous amount of thunder could be felt within him. Jin Mayeol’s face turned pale.

‘This madman! That wasn’t his full power!?’

Jeon Myeonghun began to press Jin Mayeol even harder. Jin Mayeol tried to resist Jeon Myeonghun’s thunder. In terms of overall combat ability, skill, and experience as a Fusion Stage cultivator, Jin Mayeol was superior. His ‘instant reaction speed’ was also higher than Jeon Myeonghun’s.

But he gritted his teeth.

‘My experience, skill, and reaction speed are all superior, but I’m being overwhelmed by sheer power!?’

Crack!

He felt his domain being torn apart by Jeon Myeonghun’s thunder waterfall, rolling his eyes.

Crack!

After unleashing the thunder waterfall, Jeon Myeonghun gathered his six arms to form a single red thunder spear. Jin Mayeol’s face turned pale.

And then...

Boom!

A golden light flickered, and suddenly, the Demon King, considered the leader of the demonic beasts, flew in and blew up Jeon Myeonghun’s upper body. Jeon Myeonghun screamed in rage.

In Jeon Myeonghun’s vision, for 0.01 seconds, the figure of Seo Eunhyun with 19 heads appeared. Seo Eunhyun seemed to be saying something to Jeon Myeonghun, but it was too brief to understand. Using Jeon Myeonghun’s body as a springboard, Seo Eunhyun flew towards the Northern Fleet’s sea domain.

Boom!

A corner of the sea domain, spread through the dimensional barrier, was blown open. Jeon Myeonghun shouted in frustration, and Jin Mayeol stared blankly at the sea domain Seo Eunhyun had pierced through.

‘The infamous deep-sea barrier of the Conqueror Fleet... was it that easy to break?’

He shook his head.

‘He’s truly a monstrous being. I’m glad I didn’t have to face him head-on.’

Finishing his thought, Jin Mayeol swung his Yeolhaswaegeom and grotesque sword at Jeon Myeonghun, who was hurriedly regenerating his body. The battle, which seemed to be tilting in Jeon Myeonghun’s favor, became evenly matched again due to Seo Eunhyun’s intervention.

* * *

The first thought that came to Kim Yeon’s mind when she saw Bukhyanghwa was,

‘For some reason, I don’t like her.’

However, contrary to her thoughts, her judgment was swift.

‘We can’t let them complete the barrier. Capture that commander immediately!’

Srrrng, srrrng—

Eight throwing knives flowed down from Kim Yeon’s hand. The pinkish light of her consciousness flickered on the knives, and they were swung towards Bukhyanghwa. The pinkish slash flew towards Bukhyanghwa.

But then...

Boom!

Two ships escorting the ship Bukhyanghwa was on fired their cannons, shattering Kim Yeon’s slash. Kim Yeon’s eyes gleamed.

‘What? How did they block my attack with such mere artifacts...’

Feeling something strange, she swung her hand again, sending another slash, and used her body technique to charge at Bukhyanghwa. But once again, the cannons fired at her, and she realized.

Boom!

Pushed back by the fleet’s bombardment, Kim Yeon glared at the barrier spread through the sky.

‘This barrier weakens those who fight against these ships and strengthens their attacks.’

Kim Yeon’s eyes gleamed with a pinkish light as she glared at Bukhyanghwa.

‘Fighting inside this barrier will cause significant damage. I need to fight outside...’

And just as she thought that...

Boom!

A massive explosion echoed, and a large hole was blown in the sea domain formed by the Northern Fleet. It had been 5 seconds since the battle started.

“Oh my, a path has opened.”

A smile appeared on Kim Yeon’s face, and Bukhyanghwa’s face showed shock.

“No, my sea domain...!”

Kim Yeon smirked and used her body technique to swiftly pass by Jin Mayeol and Jeon Myeonghun, exiting the sea domain. She then turned her gaze to the ships maintaining the barrier from the north, south, east, and west, as well as the sky, and charged at them.

As she was about to slash at the ships, the Northern Fleet, which had re-entered the sea domain, aimed their cannons at her. But Kim Yeon laughed.

Boom!

The cannons fired directly at her, but Kim Yeon laughed.

“What, is that all? Hahaha!”

It didn’t hurt! Not at all, no damage whatsoever! Unlike inside the sea domain, outside, Kim Yeon had no reason to be overwhelmed by the Northern Fleet!

Bukhyanghwa’s face hardened, and Kim Yeon’s face brightened. Then...

Boom!

At the 7-second mark since the battle began, Seo Eunhyun and Kim Younghun, who were fighting in the distant sea, clashed, shaking the entire sea area. Using the shockwave as a signal, Kim Yeon charged at the Northern Fleet.

Bukhyanghwa formed a hand seal with a determined face. In response to her hand seal, the puppets on the ship waved white flags.

“2nd Fleet, 6th Squadron, 10th Squadron, switch to Operation B. Attach three ships each to the left and right of the flagship, and the remaining ships to the rear! Support the sea lord from the sea!”

Clang, clang, clang!

The Northern Fleet moved in unison, firing at Kim Yeon and forming a formation. The ships attached to the left and right of the flagship, and the remaining ships lined up behind, forming a snake-like shape. The Northern Fleet floated in the air, confronting Kim Yeon in the shape of a giant snake.

Clang, clang, clang!

The numerous ships connected, forming a massive puppet. The Northern Fleet, which was initially only at the level of a thousand-man unit, transformed into a giant snake puppet, its power rising to the early stage of the Sacrificial Realm.

Clang, clang, clang!

The snake made of ships moved in the air, surrounding Kim Yeon. At the same time, the cannons aimed at her, firing in unison. Kim Yeon flew towards the snake’s body, taking the bombardment head-on. Despite the concentrated fire, it was not enough to penetrate her protective energy.

Finally, Kim Yeon managed to attach herself to one of the ships forming the snake’s body. Bukhyanghwa, seeing this, made a quick decision.

“437th ship, detach and self-destruct!”

Clang, clang!

The ship detached from the snake’s body, and the few remaining crew members evacuated. Kim Yeon felt the explosive energy rising from within the ship. But her expression remained calm.

Tstststst!

She activated her unique technique, and the voice of her master echoed in her mind. Though he was a madman, he taught her about puppets with a clear mind.

—Listen well, my disciple. My unique fortress and all my creations are fundamentally superior to any mechanical device in this world. Unless they are puppet masters of the True Immortal or Sacred Realm, no one can create a puppet superior to mine. Hehe...

Though his words seemed arrogant, Kim Yeon knew from firsthand experience that they were true.

—All mortal puppets in this world are fundamentally inferior to my puppets. They are nothing but primitive mechanical devices handled by idiots. Yes, the vast majority of mortal technology is a lower version of my unique fortress. Do you understand what this means?

His arrogance was not overconfidence but confidence.

—You can suppress and seize inferior puppets of other puppet masters using the unique technique I taught you and my circuits. Today, I brought a Sacrificial Realm puppet master for you to practice on.

Kim Yeon’s unique technique, shaped like her master’s circuits, infiltrated the ship. She sighed.

‘Well, it’s not that inferior.’

Though it was a lower version compared to her master’s unique fortress, it was still a collection of considerable technology. It felt more like an evolution in a different direction rather than a lower version. But she wasn’t worried. After all, her circuits had already taken control of the ship.

Kiiing!

The self-destruct command was halted. Kim Yeon, having taken control of the ship, met Bukhyanghwa’s astonished gaze.

“Alright, here I go.”

Rumble!

Using her own power as the energy source, the ship flew like a rampaging beast, ramming into the nearby Northern Fleet ships.

Boom!

At the same time, the connecting parts of the Northern Fleet ships attached to the ship Kim Yeon controlled, linking them together. Kim Yeon’s eyes gleamed as she began to take control of the other Northern Fleet ships through the ship she had seized.

Bukhyanghwa, watching from the flagship’s command room, grimaced.

“What are you doing to my creation!?”

Crackle!

As her emotions intensified, three-colored patterns appeared on her face. Unlike when she was in the Water Realm, the patterns had evolved, with two of the three colors partially mixed. Bukhyanghwa gritted her teeth and manipulated several devices in the command room. The command room detached from the flagship, transforming into a spider-shaped puppet.

—Captain! What are you doing!?

—Captain, please calm down!

The crew’s shouts were ignored by the crazed Bukhyanghwa. The spider puppet quickly descended the snake’s body, reaching the ship Kim Yeon had seized. Bukhyanghwa began to manipulate her spider puppet.

Clang, clang, clang!

The patterns on her face glowed brightly. Her hands moved faster and faster.

Rumble!

Countless devices emerged from the spider puppet’s legs, dismantling and modifying the Northern Fleet ships in real-time. In an instant, the command system of one ship was changed, and the ship Kim Yeon had seized was reset. Bukhyanghwa quickly input herself as the commander, reclaiming the ships Kim Yeon had taken.

Finally, the spider puppet stepped onto the ship Kim Yeon was on. Kim Yeon smirked.

“Oh my, you came all the way down here. Do you think I can’t seize that puppet too?”

“Don’t insult my creations! Get off my ship!”

“No. We’re in the middle of a battle, what nonsense are you spouting?”

“Ugh, as a fellow puppet master, let’s fight fairly with our puppets.”

Kim Yeon scoffed.

“My master might have agreed with you, but not me. I don’t even take pride in being a puppet master, and I dislike my puppet master master.”

“…I thought you were annoying from the start. You really are.”

The two glared at each other. Bukhyanghwa asked,

“What’s your name? I’ll make sure to inscribe it on a puppet when I capture and modify you.”

“Kim Yeon, the Strange Ghost King. What’s yours?”

“Conqueror King Bukhyanghwa. Kim Yeon, huh? Such a good name for someone like you.”

“Haha, you better pray I don’t catch you. If I do, I’ll modify you into something like ‘General Buk.’ I learned how to make biological puppets well from my master, so I can make something good.”

“I’d rather self-destruct than be modified by a puppet master with no pride or dedicated puppet. But if you get caught by me, I’ll turn you into a much better artifact or ship, so don’t worry.”

The two puppet masters stared at each other for a moment, then quickly moved their hands.

Boom!

Kim Yeon sent a slash, and Bukhyanghwa urgently input commands.

“Activate Sea Pillar!”

Boom! Rumble!

The slash split Bukhyanghwa’s spider puppet in half, and the next moment, the ships preparing a formation in the deep sea manipulated the sea to create a giant pillar. The pillar, resembling a water column, shot into the sky, striking the ship Kim Yeon and Bukhyanghwa were on.

Rumble!

Kim Yeon squinted, looking around. In an instant, the surroundings distorted, and she realized she was in a strange subspace. Countless scenes shattered like glass, scattering around.

‘Is this the inside of the deep sea?’

In front of her was Bukhyanghwa, riding the damaged spider puppet. Kim Yeon smirked.

“You’ve used quite a trick, but what now? We’re both in the same situation.”

Kim Yeon took a step forward, but the space distorted, increasing the distance between her and Bukhyanghwa. Bukhyanghwa’s voice echoed from afar.

“Hah, you cheeky thing... I can still track your position. I can follow you anytime, so don’t worry.”

But Bukhyanghwa, hearing Kim Yeon’s words, instead left the spider puppet and sneered. 

Wooong!

She took out a glowing stone from her storage. Holding ten ancient stones, Bukhyanghwa crushed them all.

Flash!

Bukhyanghwa’s figure disappeared, leaving Kim Yeon with a blank expression.

* * *

Splash!

Bukhyanghwa caught her breath on a nearby ship. 

Rumble!

The technique of manipulating the deep sea to create a giant pillar and trap the opponent in the deep sea. Sea Pillar. The giant water column sank back into the deep sea. Kim Yeon, who was sucked into it, disappeared without
