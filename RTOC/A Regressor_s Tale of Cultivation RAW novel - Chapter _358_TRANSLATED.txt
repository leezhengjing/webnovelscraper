### Chapter 360: The Return of the Immortal Cultivator

---

"Yes, yes? Seran? Who is that?" I sighed softly as I looked at the demon in front of me. 'Full of lies.' He had been spouting so many lies that I initially thought he was Seohyeol. 'Fake appearance, fake decision-making, lying about not knowing Seran...'

Just thinking about Seohyeol, who had borrowed Seran's appearance, made a surge of murderous intent rise within me. Sensing my killing intent, Baekrin roared in fury. The demon coughed violently, as if his soul was about to leave his body, at Baekrin's roar, a practitioner of the Sa Chuk Gi.

"Enough." I raised one hand, and Baekrin stopped his roar. Hongbeom stepped forward to translate Baekrin's words.

"If you lie one more time, you will die."

"Hmm..." I didn't intend to go that far, but the demon in front of me seemed to be lying too much, so I decided to be a bit harsher. Hongbeom's threat seemed effective, as the demon, who had taken Seran's appearance, convulsed and buried his head.

"I'm sorry, my lord! Please forgive me! Ah, it's done!"

Ssssh! Steam seemed to rise in front of me, and the demon's appearance changed. The demon transformed into a silk carp within the mist, then quickly reverted to a human form.

"...First, tell me your real name." I spoke to the silk carp demon, who had transformed into a woman with colorful scales on her face. She sighed in resignation and opened her mouth.

"...My name is Yukyo, my lord. And as for Seran... I met him briefly when he came to Seongrando."

"Oh, really. How did you meet him?"

"Well..." She hesitated, and Hongbeom signaled to Baekrin. Baekrin approached Yukyo menacingly, exuding a fierce aura.

"Eek, I'll talk! Actually, he said he was looking for something in Seongrando, so I guided him."

"Hmm..." I frowned as I read her thoughts. Another lie. I signaled to Hongbeom, who then signaled to Baekrin. Baekrin, enraged, grabbed Yukyo's head with his bony hand. Hongbeom spoke.

"This is your last chance. The cult leader can detect lies, so speak the truth."

"Ugh... I understand. I'll talk. Actually, I approached Seran to deceive him by stealing his dragon-like appearance!"

"..."

I held my head, feeling dizzy from her answer. "So, what did you do to Seran?"

"I didn't do much. I just observed his appearance and behavior, and after receiving some of his energy..."

"Speak without hiding anything. What else are you hiding?"

"No, actually, I fed him a mild aphrodisiac to take his energy and... slept with him a bit..."

"..."

"Anyway, after receiving his energy, I was caught by his wife and almost killed. I managed to escape, but I stole about ten high-grade stones from Seran's island. I didn't steal anything else, I swear! Look, I still have the marks from his wife!"

Yukyo showed her belly to prove her innocence. There were marks that looked like they had been bitten by a fierce beast.

'...This is dizzying.' The fact that this demon fed Seran an aphrodisiac and stole his energy, and even robbed him of his valuables, was one thing, but the fact that Seran was married! I didn't know what expression to make as I asked her.

"So, what happened to Seran after that?"

"He ran away from his wife for a while, then found what he was looking for in Seongrando and moved to another island."

"Do you know where he went?"

"Uh... I believe it was a place called Eungudo. It's not far from here..."

"In which direction?"

"Southwest from Seongrando. It's famous for the white spiritual energy crystals gathered in the sky."

I spoke to Hongbeom. "Hongbeom, bring Seran here. I saw his dragon form through this demon, and now I'll show you his human face..."

"Oh, it's fine. I remember him from my childhood."

"Hmm...? What?"

Indeed, Hongbeom was also from the water realm, and he had met Seran and Songjin when he was a young centipede. But to remember things from before he gained spiritual awareness? I was a bit surprised but nodded, as I had been surprised by Hongbeom more than once.

"Alright, then. Go ahead."

"Understood."

Whoosh! Hongbeom disappeared to the place Yukyo had indicated using the teleportation technique, and I asked her.

"As you saw, we came from the Ghost Realm and don't know much about the situation in the High Power Realm. Explain what the high-grade stones are, the power structure of the High Power Realm, and its characteristics."

"Ah... Yes, understood. First, high-grade stones..."

She took out a couple of glowing stones from her storage.

"These are high-grade stones. They are used as currency in the High Power Realm."

"It doesn't seem like they are used to charge spiritual energy. What kind of stones are they?"

"Ah, high-grade stones are unique to the High Power Realm. They can only be obtained from the deep sea or from deep-sea monsters. The characteristic of high-grade stones is 'return.'"

"Return?"

"Yes. High-grade stones are also called 'stones that accumulate history.' They endlessly record the paths they have traveled and, when given a specific stimulus, they show the path they have taken."

Crack! When she crushed one of the high-grade stones, it emitted light, showing a faint thread of light tracing the path Yukyo had taken to get captured by Jeon Myeonghun.

"Ho..."

"Of course, if you stimulate only one stone, it just shows the path it has taken. But if you stimulate more than ten stones at once, they emit 'attraction,' allowing you to return from the deep sea to the surface in one go. That's why high-grade stones are also called 'return stones.'"

"Interesting. But is the deep sea that dangerous? If someone uses water realm techniques, they wouldn't need return stones, right?"

However, Yukyo looked at me with a puzzled expression for a moment. But then, realizing we came from the Ghost Realm, she nodded.

"Ah, sorry. People from other worlds or those who haven't ascended don't know. I've heard that in other worlds, the sea is filled with 'water,' so sometimes people who haven't ascended yet jump into the deep sea to enjoy swimming, leading to tragic accidents."

"...So you're saying the sea below isn't filled with water?"

It was strange. Not only what I saw, but the entire sea seemed to be filled with dense water energy. It was a place full of water energy, yet it wasn't a sea? It was a bizarre statement. Yukyo nodded and explained.

"Yes, what exists below is something that looks very similar to water but isn't water. It's a 'dimension.'"

"What?"

I was taken aback and asked again, and Yukyo continued calmly.

"The deep sea of the High Power Realm is a place where countless 'dimensions' overlap. The density of the dimensions is so high that it appears similar to water, but it's fundamentally different. If you go down there, the space twists instantly, making it impossible to know where you came from. The deep sea is filled with all sorts of rare treasures from different dimensions, but it's also full of monsters like deep-sea creatures, and if you take a wrong step, you'll fall into a deep dimension. That's why return stones are 'essential' when entering the deep sea."

"Huh..."

I looked down at the sea below, feeling incredibly curious. As I stared at the sea for a long time, I suddenly saw something shining like a star below.

'Ah, I see.'

It wasn't something like a star; it was a 'real star.' I could see the 'sky' gathered below the sea. However, the night sky I saw was scattered like waves, and soon, other shimmering shapes appeared.

"Why does such a thing exist in the High Power Realm?"

"Well... I don't know for sure, but according to legend, it's the remnants of a destroyed world."

"Remnants of a destroyed world?"

"Yes. They say it's an ancient world that no longer exists. The dimensions reflected in the deep sea are worlds that were destroyed long ago, and the deep sea of the High Power Realm was formed by accepting the fragments of those destroyed worlds."

"..."

I felt like I understood the conditions for ascending to the High Power Realm. "Did you say there were ascendants in the High Power Realm?"

"Yes."

"Do you know the conditions for ascending to the High Power Realm?"

"Yes, I have a rough idea..."

I felt like I understood why I had arrived in the High Power Realm, so I asked her about my hypothesis.

"Is the condition for ascending to the High Power Realm to possess the power or relics of a destroyed world?"

"Ah, yes. I believe that's correct."

Hearing the Salt Mountain Master's incantation and using the Taesan Yeolje Gong, I could be sure. The Salt Mountain Master was a dead being. And true immortals are so vast that they can be considered worlds themselves. That means the remnants of a destroyed world are...

'The traces of dead true immortals, or something equivalent to them. That must be it.'

I looked at the sea below with a grim expression. I had thought the Ghost Realm, where dozens of true immortals were watching, was the most eerie and creepy place, but I was wrong. The High Power Realm, where the corpses of true immortals were piled up like a sea, was even more terrifying.

Whether she knew my uneasy feelings or not, she continued to explain, rolling her eyes.

"...Anyway, next is the basic regions of the High Power Realm. The High Power Realm is divided into three main regions. First, the Water Flow (Suryu) region where you and I are. First of all... people from other worlds often misunderstand, but please look at the sky."

"Hmm?"

I looked up at the sky at her words. Unlike the Ghost Realm, it was a blue sky. Unlike the Ghost Realm and the True Demon Realm, which had no sun, the High Power Realm had something similar. It was the long ring surrounding the sky. However, I was startled as I looked at the sky.

'The celestial energy... can't be read!'

As I was taken aback, she explained.

"First of all... I've heard that the sky in other worlds is an endless void. I don't know what that feels like, but in the High Power Realm, the sky has an official name. It's called the Firmament (Gungchang). And the firmament is not an empty void but 'another' deep sea. If you go up into the sky, you'll reach the firmament and fall into the deep sea."

"...So..."

I immediately understood her words. The sky and the ground are both seas. How can such a structure exist? It's simple.

"This world, the space we are breathing in, is like an air bubble in the water, right?"

"Exactly!"

That's right. This world is like an air bubble. A giant air bubble inside a vast sea. The creatures of the High Power Realm live inside this bubble.

"To continue explaining the Water Flow region, each 'air bubble' is called a 'sea area.' And the High Power Realm is made up of countless sea areas. The Water Flow region refers to the sea areas on the outskirts of the High Power Realm."

She continued her explanation.

"And as you move towards the center, the size of the sea areas, or air bubbles, increases. At the very center is the largest sea area. Think of it as a large air bubble in the center of many small air bubbles. And that large air bubble is called the Dao Departure (Dogeo) region."

"Hmm?"

I paused because the name sounded familiar. Water Flow. Dao Departure. Then the next one is...

"Then the next region is the Phoenix Nourishment (Bongyang) region?"

"Uh, no."

"..."

"There is no Phoenix Nourishment region... Anyway, the Dao Departure region is the largest sea area, and it has its own gravitational force, pulling other small sea areas towards it, preventing them from scattering into the deep sea. And the last region is the Sacrificial Rite (Chije) region."

"...!"

"The Sacrificial Rite region is a large continent in the center of the Dao Departure region. In fact, the High Power Realm only has islands, so the Sacrificial Rite region is the only continent. The Sacrificial Rite region is where the High Power Realm's Holy Master, Haerin, resides and oversees the entire High Power Realm. If the Dao Departure region is like the capital, the Sacrificial Rite region is a sacred land visited during important times like the Thousand Tribulations."

"..."

I fell into thought. There was no Phoenix Nourishment region, but even without it, Water Flow, Dao Departure, and Sacrificial Rite were familiar names.

'The Salt Mountain Master's storage island.'

His storage island also had Water Flow, Dao Departure, Phoenix Nourishment, and Sacrificial Rite layers. And in his storage island, the Phoenix Nourishment layer was originally a middle layer created between the Dao Departure and Sacrificial Rite layers, so the real layers were only Water Flow, Dao Departure, and Sacrificial Rite.

'Indeed, thinking about it, the High Power Realm is Kangnyeong... And the successor of Kangnyeong, the master of the Salt Mountain, was the Salt Mountain Master...'

I signaled Yukyo to continue explaining.

"Yes, then I'll explain the power structure of the High Power Realm. First of all, there are no major powers in the High Power Realm. Only the Sea King Palace (Haewangjeon) ruled by Holy Master Haerin is the supreme power. The High Power Realm's lords once fought among themselves, causing several sea areas to be destroyed. After that, the Holy Master purged the lords and banned any major powers other than the Sea King Palace. Thanks to that, there are no major powers other than the Sea King Palace, and only small palaces (Gung) exist, ruled by the sea area lords. Below the palaces are dozens or hundreds of islands, each ruled by an island lord (Doju). They have minor conflicts, but there are no major power struggles."

"I see... So the Holy Master doesn't interfere in minor sea area conflicts?"

"That's right."

'We can spread our teachings freely.'

Of course, the reason the Infinite Sect thrived in the Ghost Realm was because it provided physical bodies, which wouldn't be significant to the creatures of the High Power Realm. But it still meant we could retaliate if a sea area lord caused trouble, so it didn't matter. I asked Yukyo.

"By the way, I'm curious. What are those islands below? If the sea below is a dimension, how can those islands float on it?"

"Ah...! Those islands are made of high-grade stones. They have high-grade stone veins buried in them, so they never sink. Moreover, high-grade stones have the property of remembering their original position and exerting gravitational force, so they stay in place even if the dimension shakes."

"Didn't you say high-grade stones are used as currency? If someone mines all the high-grade stones, will those islands sink?"

"Yes. That's why mining high-grade stones on islands is strictly prohibited. If caught, the miners are used as bait to lure deep-sea monsters. When the monsters are lured by the bait, they are hunted, and the high-grade stones obtained from the monsters are used to replace the mined stones. The miners are only released after they have replaced ten times the amount of high-grade stones they mined. Of course, most of the bait dies before that, so it's essentially a death sentence."

"Hmm, I see."

I nodded. "For now, we'll stay afloat in this area. We'll hunt deep-sea monsters to obtain enough high-grade stones to keep the entire Gwangum area from sinking before we land! Understood?"

The surrounding guardian ghost kings responded loudly. I spoke to Yukyo.

"Thank you for the explanation. Since you've provided useful information, we'll treat you as a guest."

"Oh, no. I'm useless, so just throw me nearby, and I'll disappear on my own. Hehe..."

"Sorry, but we need a local for a bit longer. Baekrin, take her to the guest room."

Baekrin responded loudly and dragged Yukyo away. Yukyo looked at me with a fearful face, but I knew Baekrin's kind heart, so I didn't worry and looked at the sky. The celestial energy couldn't be read.

'Interesting. A world without a sky...'

In such a world, it would be very difficult for celestial beings to survive. Of course, the fragments of dimensions showed starlight, so the Seven Star Technique might work, but without reading the celestial energy properly, they would be at a disadvantage in information warfare.

'A world full of earth beings...'

It was an interesting place. And just then, a familiar shadow flew from afar. A black centipede demon was cutting through the sky, heading this way.

Boom! Hongbeom landed in front of me.

"I'm back, master."

"Good job, and..."

I looked at the two figures sitting on Hongbeom's head.

"Long time no see, friend."

A half-human, half-dragon in black clothes. It was Seran.

### Main Base of the Northern Fleet

An old ghost, who had been lying in his seat until just now, was biting his fingers and pacing around the room.

"Damn it, my disciple is in the Wijeong Sea Area, and an otherworldly being has invaded the Wijeong Sea Area? Whether it's a deep-sea monster or a void poet, if the shock reached the neighboring sea area, it must be an enormous being... My disciple must be safe... Do we have any remaining clairvoyance?"

The old ghost looked at the white-clad woman, who was holding a hot jade ornament. She took out her storage island and searched for something inside.

"Hmm, it seems we used all the clairvoyance when we occupied this sea area. There's none left."

"Damn... Ah! Didn't you say you were developing a tracking device before?"

"Yes... But Elder Song said we didn't need it since we had clairvoyance, so I stopped developing it."

The white-clad woman looked at the old ghost with a slightly sulky expression, and the old ghost spoke to her, flustered.

"Hmm, sorry. Everything has its use... So you really didn't develop it?"

"Hmm... I have a prototype. But it's not as effective as clairvoyance, and it can only roughly measure Seran's location."

The white-clad woman took out a small crystal from her storage island. When she infused spiritual energy into the crystal, it glowed, and a map of the sea area appeared above it. A large black sphere floated above the map.

"This, this is..."

"This is the situation in the Wijeong Sea Area. Something ominous is floating above the Wijeong Sea Area. And this size... If it's a living being, it's at least at the level of a combined stage grandmaster. It could be even higher."
