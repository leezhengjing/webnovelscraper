**Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 374: At Sea (2)**

"10,000 years later...!"

I gasped. Although 10,000 years seemed like a long time, for cultivators above the Nascent Soul stage, it wasn't that long.

"Why is the apocalypse happening?"

"Hmm, I don't know the details... but from what I've heard, when the energy of the Celestial Realm reaches its peak, the star system contracts, leading to the apocalypse."

"What?"

"The Sage calls it the Great Collapse or the Great Contraction. My nickname and techniques are derived from it."

According to Zhang Yi, the Celestial Realm we are in seems to be continuously expanding, but at some point, it starts to contract and eventually returns to a single point of origin.

"I don't know the exact reason why this happens. And from what I know, even if the Great Contraction occurs, the Middle Realm will never be destroyed."

"The Middle Realm won't be destroyed?"

"Yes. However, according to the Sage, when the Great Contraction occurs and the apocalypse arrives, even if the Middle Realm remains intact, this Celestial Realm will be filled with intense heat and light, making it impossible for any living being to survive. Everything will turn into primordial light and vanish. Unless one is at the Quasi-Sage level, they won't be able to resist and will perish. Even the Sages who are integrated with the Middle Realm might not survive; it's truly terrifying."

I shuddered at the horrifying truth.

'So, I need to grow strong enough to withstand the apocalypse within 10,000 years.'

However, I wasn't sure if I could reach the Ascension stage even after 10,000 years.

"...I understand about the apocalypse. Then, may I ask one last question?"

"Go ahead."

"I've heard that to advance to the next stage, one must sever all ties."

"That's correct. Oh, have you grasped the clue to the next stage?"

"No, I just heard about it."

"That's also a skill. Well... yes, if you want to enter the same realm as me, you must sever all ties."

I asked with a serious look.

"How do I sever them?"

Zhang Yi seemed to understand what I was trying to say by looking at my intent.

"I see. You can't sever them, can you?"

"Yes. In fact, the reason I tried to send a clone to the Thunder Sound Sea while crossing the middle zones of the High Realm was because of this."

I revealed my true feelings without hesitation.

"I came to ask if there is an external method to reach that realm without severing ties, or if one must truly sever everything to reach it."

"Hmm..."

Zhang Yi stroked his chin and spoke.

"First, let me tell you the difference between the general Ascension stage and my realm. Those in the Ascension stage find ties and emotions meaningless after reaching that stage. On the other hand, I had to sever such things to reach this realm."

I pondered the difference between the two.

'In the Ascension stage, ties and emotions naturally disappear after reaching the stage. But in this realm beyond the Seated Meditation, one must sever ties and emotions to cross over?'

However, I felt something strange and asked.

"But doesn't the Sage of the Contraction have emotions?"

"How do you know if I have emotions or not? Are you saying you can read my intent?"

He smirked and took out a golden apple from the bonfire. 

Crunch—

For some reason, although it was an apple, it oozed meat juice instead of fruit juice. The apple emitted a protein smell.

Zhang Yi tore into the apple-like meat and looked me in the eye. His mouth moved greedily, but his eyes were cold and empty.

Indeed, it was very difficult to read Zhang Yi's intent. His intent seemed so hollow, blurry, and doubtful if it even existed. From the perspective of those who had reached the Three Flowers Gathering stage, Zhang Yi might appear as a sophisticated meat puppet rather than a living being.

Swoosh!

While I was staring at him, I felt as if I was sucked into his empty eyes. When I came to my senses, I was in a cosmic space where all the stars shone green.

It was an illusion caused by Zhang Yi's pressure.

Rumble—

My mind felt like it was being crushed. Feeling terrified, I looked up and saw a green nebula taking the shape of Zhang Yi's face, looking down at me.

'This is... the magnitude of the Sage of the Contraction's mind...'

It wasn't just about the size of his divine sense. The intent he had pushed throughout his life was that enormous.

'Is he going to cook my brain...'

I couldn't regain my senses under that pressure. However, I knew one thing. Zhang Yi had emotions! And he cherished his ties!

"I once heard something from someone."

I opened my mouth, not yielding to his pressure.

"After hearing a mockery that the mind is merely a metallic function, I conveyed that mockery to someone, and he replied."

The words that Seo Hyul mocked Gyu Ryeon's mind with, and Zhang Yi responded to.

"If the mind is metal, then according to the classification of cultivators, metal (金) corresponds to Heaven (乾), meaning the mind is as eternal as the sky."

I shouted, quoting Zhang Yi's words from my previous life in front of him in this life.

"Isn't that right, Sage? The human mind can never be erased, can it?"

As I shouted and refined my consciousness, I found myself back in front of the bonfire, free from Zhang Yi's pressure.

"This... is something."

Zhang Yi looked at me, crossed his arms, and laughed.

"That's right. Emotions can never be erased. That's why even Sages have emotions, greed, and fear. Although I said that other Sages' ties and emotions disappear, in reality, they don't. It's just a difference in perspective..."

"...! So, does that mean the way to reach the next stage is not to discard the mind but to properly acknowledge and refine emotions?"

"Eh... no."

He bit into the golden apple as if wondering what I was talking about.

"You must erase what cannot be erased. Do you understand? To reach this place, you must do so."

"Then how do I erase it?"

"I told you. You can't erase it."

He laughed, saying something incomprehensible.

"You must be able to erase what cannot be erased to enter here. Finding out how to erase the unerasable will be your future cultivation method."

"......"

"Strictly speaking, although I said I would take you as my disciple, there's not much I can teach you. As an advanced cultivator, I can only give you advice. Each of our clan members is entirely different."

He pointed somewhere and spoke.

"When you entered the Thunder Sound Sea, you must have fallen into a region where you couldn't use prayer rituals. Isn't that right?"

"Yes."

"How did you get out?"

"I raised the Total Heaven Sword to the level of a divine weapon and cut through space to escape."

"When I first arrived there, I stimulated my body to extend my sensing range, drew in the energy outside the space, and shattered the space to escape. Just like that, you and I have different methods even for escaping a single place. I could recite my enlightenment to you, but it wouldn't suit you and wouldn't be helpful."

Swoosh—

Zhang Yi stood up and spoke.

"Therefore, even among my disciples, there are none who can truly be called my successors. All I can do is assign training tasks that seem suitable for my disciples."

I listened to his words with a serious expression.

"Now, I'll assign you a training task. The first training task."

He smirked and spoke.

"Go outside the Thunder Sound Sea and cut down a star. You can use the power of the Celestial and Earth Clans, treasures, or even the help of others. Use any means to destroy a star. Oh, I mean a star without any living beings. Don't invade an innocent planet and destroy a civilization."

Whoosh!

He swung his saber, and the light from Zhang Yi's saber pierced my soul and embedded itself in my mind.

Crack!

Just like before, Zhang Yi's saber was now positioned on one side of my sword mountain.

Flash!

As Zhang Yi waved his arm, I was suddenly pushed far away from the bonfire, passing through countless time and space.

Swoosh!

Countless scenes passed by me, and I found myself in a star system illuminated by countless starlight.

Rumble!

And in front of me, where I had emerged, was a massive sea of stars shrouded in a dimensional barrier.

'That is the remains of Yang Sujin.'

The sea of stars took the form of a giant ring finger, each segment almost the size of Earth. Judging by its shape, it seemed to be the left ring finger.

'Is Yang Sujin's treasure a ring?'

The inside of the ring finger-shaped sea of stars was hollowed out in a circular shape. It was a mark left by wearing a ring. It seemed to have been worn for a long time.

The ring finger, called the Thunder Sound Sea, was said to be the entrance to the space where his treasure was located. So, if I reached another space through the Thunder Sound Sea, I might find a giant ring.

'But cutting down a star...'

Contrary to my expectation of being beaten by Zhang Yi, it seemed his training method was to give tasks without much interference.

'A star...'

I recalled Zhang Yi splitting a planet in half.

'With my current power... even if I use the Three-Tai Chi, I can only plow the surface of a continent and leave a crack on the planet...'

That was my limit. It was also the limit of a typical Nascent Soul cultivator.

'If I combine the early stage of Seated Meditation with the physical and mental size of the Celestial and Earth Clans... and borrow the power of treasures and formations...'

It seemed somewhat possible.

I thought I understood what Zhang Yi meant.

'He wants me to raise my cultivation as much as possible and come back.'

After all, although I was imitating the Nascent Soul level by combining the early stage of Seated Meditation with the physical and mental size of the Celestial and Earth Clans, my actual stage was the Nascent Soul.

'Okay, let's go back and raise my stage as much as possible.'

With that decision, I sought my avatar, Ham Jin.

Buzz!

Since I had crossed over to the star system through Ham Jin, we were connected, making it easy to find him.

Flash!

Ham Jin had fallen on a star near the Thunder Sound Sea where living beings could survive. He had established a primitive tribal nation on one side of the continent and was actively working to proliferate descendants as the great chieftain of the tribe.

"...Ham Jin."

"Huff, huff... Huh!"

Sensing my presence, he came out of his stone house to greet me.

"Great King of the Infinite, have you come? I have been spreading the teachings of the Infinite Sect here for you! I have also promulgated the Infinite King Ritual to honor you!"

"...Phew, well done. Thanks to you, it will be easier when I return. Let's go back now."

"Ah... actually, I have made 13 wives here, but I have only given love to three of them. Can I give love to all of them equally...?"

I chuckled at his absurdity and spoke.

"Reach the Nascent Soul stage and come back later."

"Ah, understood. Then, may I say goodbye to my wives for a moment..."

After calling the chieftains and saying something to them, he received bows from dozens of chieftains and wives, then received numerous gifts of spiritual stones, specialties, and strange items before flying to me. Somehow, he looked a bit gloomy.

"...No one is stopping me. They all said they liked me so much, but when I said I was leaving, they welcomed me with open arms and even bowed to send me off... how heartless. Home is the best. I want to see my wives back home."

"...Shut up. Let's go."

I entered Ham Jin's body.

"That person named Zhang Yi told me that the star with the High Realm teleportation array is that one."

"Yes."

I descended on the star with the middle zone of the High Realm.

'The world with the middle zone is said to be on the body of a True Immortal.'

In other words, this star was also a True Immortal.

'And... the world where Ham Jin is also disguised as a True Immortal.'

I had wondered how the world remained intact despite the battles of the Ascension stage cultivators, but it seemed there was no problem because it was the body of a True Immortal.

'Zhang Yi must have told Ham Jin the location of the middle zone of the High Realm for me to use. And if he told me to use it, it means the True Immortal who tried to capture us has fallen asleep again.'

In other words, there was no problem in returning.

Buzz!

I began to cross countless time and space again with Ham Jin.
