### Return to Cultivation (回歸修仙傳) Chapter 394: Drinking Deeply (4)

**Buzz!**

As I operated the incantation of the *Zihun Mantian*, the *yuan ying* within me trembled. Then, it seemed to be dyed purple for a moment before transforming into something with an alien nature.

‘What is this…?’

I could feel it. My *yuan ying* had now become the most suitable form for seizing another’s body.

‘Is the *Zihun Mantian* a secret art for body possession…?’

I furrowed my brows and delved deeper into the *Zihun Mantian*. Just as I was about to continue operating the incantation, a sudden disturbance occurred.

**Buzz— Crackle!**

“…!”

My *yuan ying*, which had turned purple, suddenly convulsed and released its power. After a while, the *yuan ying* expelled all the power dyed by the *Zihun Mantian* and returned to its original state. The nature of the *yuan ying* altered by the *Zihun Mantian* had reverted.

‘What is this…?’

However, I focused more on another phenomenon than the fact that the spell had been undone.

‘The incantation of the spell resisted as if it were alive when I tried to activate it.’

It was a very bizarre occurrence.

‘Is this why Jin Mayeol said we couldn’t obtain the *Zihun Mantian*?’

To activate a spell, one must infuse spiritual power into the incantation and trigger it. However, when spiritual power was infused into the incantation of the *Zihun Mantian*, it resisted as if it were alive and then unraveled.

‘An incantation cannot be alive. Even if spiritual power is infused into it, it’s just a mass of spiritual energy, not a soul. But something that isn’t a soul is moving as if it were alive?’

Interestingly, I knew of something similar.

‘It’s like the deep-sea monsters.’

In the depths of the *Goryeok* realm, monsters born from the amalgamation of various memories and histories of a destroyed world. Those were the deep-sea monsters of the *Goryeok* realm.

‘Is this why Jin Mayeol tried so hard to imitate the *Haeryong* tribe’s body and transform into one using the *Yonghyeong Dungapsul*?’

The *Haeryong* tribe could navigate the depths of the *Goryeok* realm. They might have hoped that the *Haeryong* tribe could somehow control the incantation of the *Zihun Mantian*, which was akin to a deep-sea monster formed from the memories of the deep sea.

However, after experiencing the incantation of the *Zihun Mantian*, I shook my head.

‘Can the *Haeryong* tribe really control this technique, which is no different from a deep-sea monster?’

Honestly, it seemed highly unlikely.

‘But Yukrin is using it. So Jin Mayeol must be approaching Yukrin to ask about the usage of the *Zihun Mantian*.’

This meant that the *Zihun Mantian* was related to the *Haeryong* tribe.

‘The *Zihun Yuxi* of the *Ziyin*….’

*Zihun Mantian*. *Tahun Mantian*. *Haeryong* King *Seohyeol*. *Yukrin* with the body of a *Haeryong*. *Yeomhae Gwirok*. *Yukyo*. *Bongrae Island* and *Yeomjeong*. *Goryeok* realm. ….

‘All of these seem connected somehow.’

But I couldn’t figure out exactly how they were connected. It was frustrating.

As I pondered, unable to find an answer, I decided to move my *Zuatallipmang* clone. And then it hit me.

“…Wait.”

I suddenly recalled the incantation of the *Zihun Mantian*.

“Wait, wait, wait…!”

Something was about to come to mind. The *Zuatallipmang* clone. And the incantation of the *Zihun Mantian*. And the fact that Yukrin used the *Zihun Mantian* to hide in the realm of souls, evading both me and Kim Yeonghun!

That’s right! The *Zihun Mantian* is entirely situated in the realm of souls, just like the strike of the *Zuatallipmang*!

**Buzz!**

I focused my consciousness and chanted the incantation of the *Zihun Mantian*, dyeing my *yuan ying*. Then, I imbued my *yuan ying* into the *Chongcheon Sword* and swung it towards the void!

The strike of the *Zuatallipmang*!

**Slash!**

My *yuan ying* began to ascend completely into the realm of souls, driven by the incantation of the *Zihun Mantian* and the strike of the *Zuatallipmang*.

**Buzz!**

‘I can see it.’

Upon ascending to the realm of souls, I could see the structure of the *Zihun Mantian*.

‘It binds the *qi* to the soul.’

*Qi* carries history. In other words, *qi* is information. From the realm of souls, I could understand.

**Buzz—**

‘The incantation of the *Zihun Mantian* gathers *qi* and collects information within, functioning similarly to a human soul.’

And the artificial soul created in this way moved like a deep-sea monster, trying to escape my control.

**Crack!**

With my *yuan ying* and the *Zuatallipmang* clone, I captured this deep-sea monster-like information entity in the complete realm of souls.

**Rumble!**

The information entity created by the incantation of the *Zihun Mantian* struggled madly, trying to escape from the grasp of me and my clone. But combined with the power of the *Zuatallipmang*, the entity was eventually subdued.

**Crack!**

I tightly grasped the subdued information entity and focused my consciousness. When I opened my eyes again, I had managed to obtain the *Zihun Mantian*, which, though still somewhat resistant, was under my control.

‘Ha… Jin Mayeol, you bastard.’

If Jin Mayeol knew this, he would lose his mind.

‘For someone who has reached the level of the *Zuatallipmang*, mastering the *Zihun Mantian* is incredibly easy. From the beginning….’

Of course, I still only had the reins of the *Zihun Mantian* and hadn’t fully controlled it. It seemed almost impossible to completely control it, as the *Zihun Mantian* was extremely unruly. It felt like I was forcibly moving it by pressing it down with the power of the *Zuatallipmang* in the realm of souls.

‘If one doesn’t possess the power to reach the realm of souls, mastering it might be impossible.’

As I operated the *Zihun Mantian*, I closed my eyes and moved my *yuan ying*, which had turned purple, through the void.

**Buzz—**

My *yuan ying* melted into the darkness in the void and reappeared ten *zhang* away in an instant.

“…I see!”

I finally understood the principle behind how *Seohyeol* had infused the *Tahun Mantian* into my ‘shadow’ last time. The *Zihun Mantian* could move through darkness, similar to the *Sim-eo* of the *Sim* tribe.

Assuming that the *Zihun Mantian* and the *Tahun Mantian* share the same root, *Seohyeol* must have hidden the *Tahun Mantian* in the darkness and attached it to my shadow like the *Sim-eo*.

‘And the reason Yukrin could invade my mind as soon as I sat on the throne of the *Bongrae* kingdom must be the same principle.’

Yukrin must have hidden his *Zihun Mantian* clone in the shadow of the throne. When I sat on the throne, merging my shadow with the throne’s shadow, he invaded my mind.

‘He didn’t just walk out from behind the throne for no reason.’

**Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh….**

Since *Bongrae Island* was currently submerged in the deep sea, it was quite dark around. Thanks to that, I experimented with the movement technique of appearing and disappearing like teleportation using the *Zihun Mantian*.

‘A secret art that allows movement anywhere in the darkness, similar to the *Sim-eo* of the *Sim* tribe.’

That was part of the ability of the *Zihun Mantian*.

‘I think I understand one more principle of the *Tahun Mantian*.’

In the deep darkness of *Seohyeol’s* mind. The reason *Seohyeol’s* mind, which must be far away, could communicate and exchange the *Obok Gichuk* across vast spacetime. It was because, like the *Zihun Mantian*, the *Tahun Mantian* also had the ability to move anywhere in the darkness in the form of the *Sim-eo*.

After retrieving my *yuan ying*, I activated the *Zihun Mantian* again.

**Swoosh—**

Although my physical body didn’t completely disappear since it didn’t belong to the realm of souls, I could hide by melting into the darkness instantly.

‘And in this state.’

I swung the *Chongcheon Sword* towards the void.

**Whoosh!**

*Wolsugung Murok*! In the darkness where no one’s gaze could reach. I unleashed the *Wolsugung Murok*, severing even the perception of those belonging to the darkness.

“…Heh, hehahahaha!”

And I laughed. It wasn’t a meaningless laugh. With the *Zihun Mantian*, I could now enter the same darkness as *Seohyeol*. If we could both stand in the same darkness, the only thing left was to identify each other in that darkness! And I had the *Wolsugung Murok*!

“Hehahahahaha!!!”

*Seohyeol*. Now, I am no longer afraid even if you find your eyes! I had obtained a crucial weapon to face him. It was an incredibly valuable experience.

**Crack—**

Of course, the downside was that the *Zihun Mantian* struggled madly, requiring significant mental effort to restrain it.

‘Using the *Zihun Mantian* might limit my ability to use martial arts.’

The number of times I could unleash the strike of the *Zuatallipmang* would likely decrease.

‘But when facing *Seohyeol*, nothing could be more useful.’

I experimented with moving through the darkness using the *Zihun Mantian* a bit more. The *Zihun Mantian* gathered *qi* in the realm of *qi*, formed information entities with that *qi*, and elevated them to the realm of souls. Thanks to these information entities ascending to the realm of souls, my *yuan ying* turned purple.

‘And if I gather and shape these information entities….’

**Buzz!**

**Rumble!**

A purple mist appeared around my *yuan ying* as I activated the *Zihun Mantian*. The purple mist howled like a ferocious beast, trying to escape my control.

“Stay still.”

Using the power of the *Zuatallipmang*, I controlled the mist and sent a strike beyond the barrier of *Bongrae Island*, sending a clone outside.

**Rumble!**

Through the clone, I navigated through the dimensions of the deep sea.

**Boom, flash!**

With each exertion of the clone’s power, dimensions began to collapse. Dimensions with idyllic mountain valleys like a paradise, dimensions with blazing flames, dimensions with black oil flowing, and dimensions with terrifying toxic gases.

**Rumble, rumble!**

After navigating through dimensions akin to the realm of combined techniques for a while.

**Rumble!**

I sensed a vibration resonating throughout the deep sea from within a fragment of a dimension I was destroying with the clone. Soon after, the space above the dimension I was smashing broke apart, and a strange creature resembling a catfish roared. It was a deep-sea monster.

I sent the information entities controlled by the *Zihun Mantian* through the realm of souls to the clone.

**Rumble!**

Purple mist rose around the clone.

“Be quiet.”

**Thud!**

I soared into the void and split the deep-sea monster in half, then unleashed the power of the *Zihun Mantian* towards it.

**Slash!**

The mist of the *Zihun Mantian* eagerly escaped my control and enveloped the deep-sea monster’s corpse.

‘I can feel it.’

The purple mist began to deconstruct the information of the deep-sea monster. The knowledge of countless information and history that made up the deep-sea monster was reconstituted within the purple mist. And in the next moment.

**Crackle—**

As the purple mist settled, a deep-sea monster in the form of a catfish, now covered in purple, glared at me. The wound I had inflicted was gone.

**Rumble!**

The creature charged at me again. As I roughly attacked it, I realized.

‘It’s stronger than before.’

The *Zihun Mantian* had entered its body, expelling the bad parts and concentrating the good parts, causing it to evolve. After dealing with it for a while, I split it in half again.

**Thud!**

In the place where the deep-sea monster fell, a fist-sized stone remained, and the purple mist floated in the air before attaching itself to the stone.

‘This is….’

Then, the incantation of the *Zihun Mantian* began to emerge on the stone.

**Buzz—**

Reading the incantation on the stone, I shuddered. The incantation had changed. Reciting the altered incantation, I activated the *Zihun Mantian* again. And I understood.

‘The *Zihun Mantian* has evolved!’

Although it wasn’t a massive evolution, it had added a line about ‘how to counter a slash.’ It was still an evolution. A technique that deconstructs and absorbs the opponent’s soul and information to evolve.

‘Is this the *Zihun Mantian*?’

Originally, it was a technique that perfectly assimilated my *yuan ying* with the *Zihun Mantian*, devouring the opponent and evolving myself. However, since I hadn’t fully assimilated my *yuan ying* with the *Zihun Mantian*, I couldn’t devour the opponent yet.

‘With this, I have somewhat obtained the *Zihun Mantian*.’

“Although it’s a pity that I can’t evolve by devouring the opponent, it’s not what I wanted in the first place. More importantly, I can move freely in the darkness… I can quickly find *Baekrin*.”

I smiled as I tried to transmit the newly acquired power of the *Zihun Mantian* to the clone on the surface. And then, I shuddered.

“…Wait.”

Suddenly, a thought occurred to me. The *Zihun Mantian* is a secret art that deconstructs and absorbs the opponent to evolve. And the *Tahun Mantian* is a secret art that deconstructs oneself to infect the opponent. If that’s the case, can’t I use the *Zihun Mantian* to absorb *Seohyeol’s* *Tahun Mantian* array?
