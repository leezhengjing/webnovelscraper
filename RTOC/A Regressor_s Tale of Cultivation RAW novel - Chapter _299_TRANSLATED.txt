**She (3)**

I conversed with her as Seo-rip, recalling the past. The second time was different from the first; I had been the one to ask her out. Kang Min-hee had accepted. And on the third day of dating her again, it was that evening.

* * *

After work, Kang Min-hee dumped me. After just three days.

“Sigh…”

I put out my cigarette at the company smoking area and turned around. The sun was almost set, and it was getting dark.

“Are you okay now?”

“Yes. I told you, three days were enough to comfort me.”

I chuckled. Somehow, we had become frenemies.

She lit another cigarette.

“Go on, now.”

“Don’t smoke too much.”

“Mind your own business. You’re just an ex now. Get lost. Shoo.”

“No one else has probably dated and broken up in three days like us.”

I laughed at the odd situation. During our first relationship, she had asked me out, and I had ended it. This time, it was the opposite.

“Dating? It was more like excellent therapy. I’ll send the treatment fee to your account later.”

“Why do you always have to…”

“What? Do you feel reluctant now that you’re about to leave?”

“Forget it. I’m going.”

I opened the door of the smoking area. From behind, I heard Kang Min-hee’s voice.

“Now that my therapy is over, pay attention to your junior, you idiot. It suffocates me to watch you.”

“Huh? Who? Jo? Kim?”

“Kim Yeon, you moron. Why would you care about Jo? She’s been finding good places for lunch and showing them to you, not because she’s a Michelin guide but because she wants to have lunch with you?”

“…? We always eat lunch together during office meals. Why should I pay special attention to Yeon? Is she having a hard time?”

“Ah, shit... This dumbass... Get lost. You’re making me want to punch you. See you tomorrow, Assistant Manager Seo.”

I turned to her, who was talking nonsense, and said goodbye.

“Sure, see you tomorrow, Deputy Manager Kang.”

That was the last day we were closest. After that, we became truly ‘bad’ colleagues.

* * *

‘Thinking back, I was indeed an idiot back then.’

I had thought Kang Min-hee was joking about Kim Yeon. At the time, I saw Kim Yeon only as a cute junior. Anyway, after that day, my relationship with Kang Min-hee became strange. Officially, we were quite hostile. But privately, although we claimed to dislike each other, it was hard to truly hate.

Yes, we became what you’d call frenemies. However, after becoming frenemies, it wasn’t as suffocatingly awkward as before.

“…Well, that’s all the information I have about the Ghost Realm’s main branch. I don’t know much about the Ghost Realm itself, but an interesting point is that when Elder Huh-gwak reported my innate talents, the main branch said, ‘Do not come to the Ghost Realm.’”

“Hmm, that’s peculiar. Why is that? With your talents, wouldn’t the Ghost Realm be suitable for you?”

“That’s what I thought. But word has it that someone important in the Ghost Realm is always watching, so it would be dangerous for me to go there.”

“Someone important…”

I recalled the information Seo-hul had given me in the previous life.

‘The Ghost Realm is always watched by True Immortals in the True God Realm.’

According to him, there’s a way to reach the True God Realm from the Ghost Realm, so True Immortals in the True God Realm always keep an eye on the Ghost Realm.

‘Indeed, if that’s the case, it could be dangerous for Kang Min-hee to go there.’

Kang Min-hee fumbled around and soon picked up a long pipe from a nearby table.

“Fire.”

Siiizzle—

A ghostly blue flame from the room’s ghost lights lit the end of her pipe.

‘Even the habit of smoking indoors when there’s no one around hasn’t changed…’

“This is my room, so I’ll smoke. Let me know if it bothers you.”

“Haha, how could I refuse when the Elder wishes it?”

“Hmm…”

She looked at me briefly.

“That thing on your face, it’s a technique, right? Try lifting it for a moment.”

“Oh… yes.”

I lifted the Black Magic Mask spell from my face, revealing the beauty of Won-yu to her.

“Oh… you’re really handsome. Hmm… but you look quite different… Why….”

“Pardon?”

“Nothing. You just remind me of someone I used to know. Even the way you subtly say no is just like him.”

Despite her words, she continued to smoke her pipe, not bothering to put it out.

Fwoosh—

Blue smoke billowed from her mouth. It seemed like she was smoking a high-grade spiritual herb.

‘If you know I’m indirectly asking you to stop, could you please put it out?’

Unlike Earth’s cigarettes, which contain carcinogens, her smoking didn’t bother others. But I preferred smoking only in designated areas. During our three-week relationship, she often smoked in the car, making our drives uncomfortable for me.

‘I still have vivid memories even after more than 2,000 years...’

It was clear how incompatible we were.

“You’re Seo-rip, right?”

“Yes.”

“I can’t tell what your soul looks like because it’s too dark... But with your talents, you’ll likely reach the Heaven Realm easily. You might catch up to my level in no time.”

“Thank you.”

“With proper support and luck or opportunities, you might reach the Underworld Realm within 500 years… Anyway, let’s get along well. Understand that I didn’t accept you into Guihun Pavilion because of the rules.”

“Of course, I understand.”

She smiled slightly and patted my shoulder. For some reason, her touch wasn’t as irritating as before.

“Have you asked everything? You can go now.”

I greeted her and left her office in Guihun Pavilion. Through her, I understood one thing.

‘Indeed, nothing has changed from 100 years ago.’

Contacting her through Jeon Myung-hun and me was the worst option.

* * *

‘I’m glad I brought Yeon.’

Kim Yeon was currently being investigated about Gwi-gun at Syuun Island. While waiting there, I thought that contacting her through Yeon would avoid making her angry or distancing us further. As a cherished junior in our department, Kang Min-hee wouldn’t scold Yeon harshly.

After some time, Kim Yeon came out from Syuun Island.

“Is it over?”

“Yes.”

Reading her thoughts, I sensed she wanted to do something.

“What’s your plan?”

“…”

After a moment’s silence, Kim Yeon pulled out [Her] left arm.

“Brother Eun-hyun, you too… I don’t know why, but you’ve also learned the Peculiar Mind Technique, right?”

“Yes. It was a fateful encounter.”

“Then, you must have seen the realization contained in this left arm?”

“That’s right.”

She looked at me, and I was startled by the determination in her eyes. Her gaze was burning with an intensity I had never seen before.

“I’m going to find out.”

Grip…

“I’m going to find out the ultimate truth of the Peculiar Mind Technique that Gwi-gun left behind. What does that scene we saw symbolize? What did he gain, and what did he lose to become a madman?”

Why was her determination so strong this life? I thought for a moment and quickly realized the reason.

‘This life, Kim Yeon… She reached her peak with her own power, even though I guided her.’

What is martial arts? There are many definitions, but one is undoubtedly ‘making oneself strong.’ The skills and studies of training oneself.

She reached the pinnacle on her own. This wasn’t merely a slight increase in strength. It required countless acts of overcoming oneself. If it were just that, she might still be insane. But I stayed connected to her, constantly conversing in her dreams, preventing Gwi-gun’s madness from overtaking her.

This life’s Kim Yeon was the most perfect version of herself.

“I will find out the truth about Gwi-gun… and then.”

She spoke with firm resolve before me.

“I will avenge myself.”

“Revenge?”

“Yes. I will exact the utmost revenge I can on him.”

Despite her words, her spirit was calm, without malice. I nodded. If she had decided something about Gwi-gun, there was no need for me to interfere with her attitude.

When I returned to Cheonbusan, the Heaven Realm elders greeted me. Kim Yeon began training in the eastern region of Cheonbusan with Jeon Myung-hun and Hong Bum. Hong Bum was in the Jizu territory, and Jeon Myung-hun was often at the remnants of Geumshinchon’s Thunder Gate, so the three rarely met.

‘I should connect with Kang Min-hee through Yeon…’

Unexpectedly, a meeting of the Heaven Realm elders was urgently convened. I was summoned to the summit of Cheonbusan, where the projections of eight elders had gathered.

Among them were the projections of Hyun-won in Gungon Castle and the secretive Tae Yeol-jeon. This indicated the importance of the issue, as even Hyun-won, recovering in Gungon Castle, and the secretive Tae Yeol-jeon were participating.

Ignoring the peculiar gaze Hyun-won sent me, I took my seat.

“Let’s begin the meeting. Thank you all for gathering. Seo and

 Hyun, who were away, might not know, but we received a report that cannot be ignored.”

Jun-jae, the head of the General Alliance, began the meeting with a heavy tone.

“It is… Black Dragon King Hyeon-eum of the Black Dragon Tribe, who has betrayed us.”

“…!”

“What…!”

The meeting hall erupted. Wi Ryeong-seon sighed deeply, and Hyun-won remained expressionless, tapping his finger on his arm. Tae Yeol-jeon, who had been silent, spoke.

“Shall I punish him as a warning?”

“Let’s discuss that after the meeting. For now, I’ll explain the situation. Recently, we received a report that the entrance to Jinma Realm was destroyed. The Sacrificial Stage guards reported that a dragon named Seo-hul destroyed the entrance on Black Dragon King’s orders.”

Apparently, this meeting was a result of my actions.

“We inquired with the Jizu, who confirmed that the commander of the Sea Dragon Tribe is named Seo-hul and that he recently went missing. Wi Ryeong-seon inspected the scene and found remnants of substantial demonic and celestial forces.”

Jun-jae continued, and Wi-soo, the Chief Military Officer and Wi Ryeong-seon’s sister, took over.

“Considering the recent disappearance of Seo-hul, the dragon commander, and the similar appearance of the attacker, it’s highly probable that Black Dragon King Hyeon-eum has betrayed us.”

Wi Ryeong-seon asked cautiously.

“Is there no possibility that someone impersonated Seo-hul to frame him?”

“According to my soul-searching technique, the guards genuinely believed it was Seo-hul. The attacker tried to eliminate evidence but was thwarted. Therefore, while it’s possible someone framed Seo-hul, he could very well be the true perpetrator.”

Wi-soo’s explanation made the elders’ expressions darken. Gae-jin sighed.

“Black Dragon King… a peak combatant among the Fusion Level warriors. Why now…”

Hyun-won spoke coldly, arms crossed.

“We should have killed him then. Talking about his usefulness complicated things.”

Apparently, Hyun-won had fought the Black Dragon King before and almost killed him.

Eung-yeon remembered something.

“Ah, I’ve heard about that… 43,000 years ago, Hyun and his fiancée almost defeated Black Dragon King…”

At that, Hyun-won glared at Eung-yeon. His projection exuded overwhelming anger. Wi Ryeong-seon and Wi-soo, siblings, scolded Eung-yeon.

“Eung, don’t mention ‘her’ in front of Hyun.”

Eung-yeon coughed and looked away.

“Ahem, sorry. I forgot.”

But Hyun-won growled at him.

“Forgot? How?”

“I apologize. I misspoke.”

“You’re busier than me, the Castle Lord? If your eyes were gouged out, you wouldn’t forget.”

Ku-gu-gu-gu!

Hyun-won’s killing intent made Eung-yeon tremble. Jun-jae sighed and cleared his throat, trying to calm the situation. But Hyun-won didn’t back down.

Then, Tae Yeol-jeon spoke softly.

“Hyun, calm down. Eung is young and inexperienced. Please understand.”

“….”

Hyun-won reluctantly suppressed his anger, seemingly wary of Tae Yeol-jeon. Jun-jae, relieved, addressed Tae Yeol-jeon.

“Tae, don’t pressure Hyun too much. It was a painful experience for him. Eung, be more careful in the future.”

Jun-jae seemed to be cautious of something related to Hyun-won.

Tae Yeol-jeon returned to her seat. I stared at her intently, and she glanced at me briefly, showing a surprised expression before looking away. Jun-jae cleared his throat and returned to the topic.

“Now, let’s discuss how to respond to Black Dragon King Hyeon-eum’s betrayal.”

* * *

The meeting decided to send a strong protest to Hyeon-eum and capture Seo-hul for interrogation. If Black Dragon King and his tribe didn’t respond, Tae Yeol-jeon would go and punish him. 

“Wi-soo, convey our message to Hyeon-eum. This concludes the meeting.”

The projections disappeared. Hyun-won looked at me before vanishing, and Tae Yeol-jeon struggled with her projection.

“Is it difficult to manage the projection?”

“Oh, Seo. Yes, it’s not my specialty. I always get confused.”

“I see... Tae, may I ask something?”

She smiled.

“I can guess. Everyone was shocked when I first joined. You must be wondering the same, Seo?”

I sighed.

“Tae, are you… a Shimzok?”

“Yes. A Fusion Level Shimzok. But I lack talent in martial arts, so I’m only at the Determination Level.”

She smiled, revealing a frightening aura.

“Shall we have a match?”

I felt a chill and excitement simultaneously.

“It’s an honor. Please teach me.”

* * *

Jizu Jinlongmeng, Hyeon-eum’s East Division.

Receiving reports from his subordinates, Black Dragon King Hyeon-eum frowned.

“Why is everything falling apart? Where is Seo-hul, and why did he destroy the Jinma Realm entrance in my name?”

Holding his head, he dismissed his subordinates.

“Damn it… why is this happening? The plan is ruined.”

After some thought, Hyeon-eum closed his eyes. With a hardened expression, he descended to the underground of his division.

“I need to communicate with my main body.”

Descending with a firm expression, his division fell into silence. For an hour or two.

Boom!

A strange beam struck Hyeon-eum’s division. 

Click-click-click...

A peculiar castle flew into Hyeon-eum’s division.

Swish—

A leaf-shaped blade moved.

“How many moves do you need?”

She asked.

Knowing it was a projection, a long battle would be disadvantageous. A short one would be best. I decided.

“Ten moves. That should be enough.”

“Ten moves? Can you handle it?”

“Yes?”

“Ten moves should be enough to kill you.”

“Haha…”

Her arrogance made me laugh. Indeed, a Fusion Level Shimzok should have this much confidence!

“Let’s see.”

“Alright, if you wish…”

Wooong—

Her leaf-shaped blade cut through the air. It was familiar. It was just like Jang Ik’s form. She wasn’t lying about being his disciple. She aimed to perform Jang Ik’s insanely precise skills.

Exactly like him.

‘But different.’

Celestial perception, Jizu’s spiritual tracking, Shimzok’s mind. Combining them, I could barely follow her blade’s path.

I followed her trajectory, realizing it was similar but different from Jang Ik’s.

Ting—

In a frozen world, her voice echoed clearly. She noticed I was preparing a counterattack and seemed intrigued. Lines connected.

Following the path of her leaf-shaped blade, spiritual veins formed. But unlike Jang Ik’s devastating technique, Tae Yeol-jeon’s blade didn’t absorb celestial energy. The force didn’t grow.

But I sensed her technique would be more dreadful than Jang Ik’s.

‘If I don’t block it properly, my body will be torn apart.’

Overwhelming power! Beyond strength, it was dominance. Initially, I planned to test pure martial skills, but I abandoned that thought. I immediately summoned the Samtaegeuk.

At the same time, I used the Danak technique.

My essence became a sword. But this time, it wasn’t for wielding the Mugaek. The essence of Danak wasn’t a mind sword but the ‘integration of power.’

I pushed all my power into the essence-sword. Simultaneously, my body became a scarecrow. Tae Yeol-jeon didn’t notice immediately. Her twin palms struck me.

But as her blue and red palms touched my powerless body, they circulated my meridians and integrated into the essence-sword through the Danak formula.
