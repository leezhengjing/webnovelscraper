Farewell (7)

As he approached the ghost with a body about ten zhang (approximately 30 meters) long, blue eyes sprouted from the ghost's body. When Seolip met those eyes, he felt his body stiffen. Seolip's body froze and could no longer move. The Great Desert Sea Star Technique and the Ghost Dao Technique he had mastered were solidifying within him, forbidding any movement. It felt as if the control over his ghostly energy had been seized by the entity before him. However, unlike last time, he was not drawn into the entity's domain to meet Kang Minhee.

Seolip gritted his teeth and shouted. But the ghost did not respond. It only stared at Seolip with completely different blue eyes than before. Seolip gritted his teeth. The ghostly energy moved, closing the path Seolip had come through. In this space, only Seolip and Kang Minhee remained. However, Seolip gradually realized that his body was moving on its own, trying to expel him from the space.

'No, this can't be!'

He couldn't move. The ghostly energy was moving on its own. Suddenly, as Seolip was speaking, he flinched.

* * *

The 'me' that Kang Minhee knew was the 'Seoeunhyun's clone' version of me. In other words, the one she had to face might not be me but Seoeunhyun. I was Seolip, not Seoeunhyun. I didn't know what right I had to call Kang Minhee, so I kept my mouth shut for a moment. I gritted my teeth. And then.

Crunch—

Forcibly. Using all the circuits of the Ghost Army and my willpower. Forcibly, forcibly!

Crunch!

I moved one arm and pulled out one of the heads attached to my shoulder.

Crunch!

It was painful. But if it were Seoeunhyun, he wouldn't even blink. The head I pulled out was condensed into a ghostly orb in the air. And then I pulled out another one.

Crunch!

It hurt. But if it were Seoeunhyun, he wouldn't even flinch.

Crunch!

"Argh!"

How many heads had I pulled out? Before I knew it, my Ghost King transformation had significantly unraveled, and my voice had returned to its human form. However, at the same time, the ghostly energy in my body was gradually decreasing. I condensed the very essence of my Ghost Dao Technique into ghostly orbs in the air.

Crunch!

I pulled out the last head. And I completely returned to a human body. However, as a human, I was only at the level of a Celestial Human. Other techniques like the Six Extreme Thunder God Technique were also temporarily extracted, leaving me significantly weakened.

"Cough, cough..."

I gasped for breath, expelling the death of 'Seoeunhyun' from my body. Of course, it felt like my heart could burst and kill me at any moment. Not just from the pain, but from the oppressive force exuded by Kang Minhee, who had reached the level of a Celestial Human! It felt like I would be crushed by that terrifying power. But!

"...I am... Seolip...!"

At this moment, I had become complete as myself. And I was no longer affected by the ghostly energy! I gathered all my remaining strength and reached out to Kang Minhee.

Crunch!

It felt like my body was being crushed. But it was okay. 'I can reach her.' With each step forward, my body broke apart. The darkness enveloping Kang Minhee was gradually pierced by the power gathered in one hand. But in return, I had to give everything. But I moved forward.

'I can reach her.'

Looking back, 'I' was born the moment I didn't convey Kang Minhee's words to Seoeunhyun. 'I' existed in this world because of her. Even if her heart was directed at Seoeunhyun, even if I was just a supporting character, even if it wasn't originally meant for me, her heart reached me, and I was born. So, I must.

Kang Minhee. I will return your heart to you.

Crunch!

Even the body of the original was starting to rot, unable to withstand the death that filled the space.

'Kang Minhee...'

I like you. Not because of Seoeunhyun's memories. The moments I spent with you, even if briefly. Combing your hair. Mistakingly trying to kill you. All those brief moments together... I really liked them.

Step, step...

As I approached her, I realized that the ten zhang-sized figure I saw was not her true form. Inside the body of the ghostly creature made of ghostly energy, I felt 'her' presence. Ignoring the freezing cold that seemed to freeze my flesh, I entered the body of the ghostly creature made of ghostly energy and took steps toward her at the center.

'Ah...'

I can't endure this. I felt it. Even if the prime Seolip were to return and resurrect seventy times, it would be impossible to go any further. My body began to freeze and turn to powder. Perhaps, just as Jeon Myunghoon was loved by lightning, Kang Minhee might be loved by all the ghosts and spirits of the world. I might be a ghost born from Seoeunhyun's delusions.

Crunch—

My entire body was disintegrating in the aura of death.

'No...'

Even if I die, I wanted to reach her. And then.

Clasp!

A warm hand grabbed my shoulder from behind.

"You fool. Why are you doing this with your bare body, abandoning the body of the Ghost King?"

It was Seoeunhyun. Somehow, he had thrown the Submyeongham outside, saved all the people of the Black Ghost Bone Valley, torn apart the closed space, and reached here.

'It's warm...'

Why is that? When Seoeunhyun grabbed my shoulder, I felt my body, which seemed to freeze in the ghostly energy, melt away.

'Is it that?'

For a moment, I saw the flame burning inside Seoeunhyun. It was the flame that scorched Seoeunhyun's soul.

"Even if it can't harm others, it seems to have a warming effect."

He explained with a smile, saying it was the effect of the karmic fire. He, too, seemed exhausted, coughing up blood.

'The pain of the karmic fire... must be unimaginable...'

How can he stand so calmly? He smiled as he held my shoulder.

"Go forward, Seolip."

"...Wouldn't it be better if you went? Maybe..."

"Do you think Kang Minhee needs me?"

"..."

"Maybe."

Seoeunhyun nodded calmly. But his next words made me clench my fists tightly.

"But it seems you need Kang Minhee."

"What do you mean..."

"Did you forget that I'm a cunning spy of the Sim Clan? Don't try to deceive my eyes. Look ahead and walk. If you have something you want to convey, do it yourself!"

Seoeunhyun's stern words snapped me back to my senses.

"...Right."

I looked ahead. Seoeunhyun's voice echoed from behind.

"Raise the ghostly orb."

Buzz!

I created a ghostly orb in my hand. I couldn't use the Moon Dao Ascension, but I could manage the Peak of the Mountain.

"Divide the ghostly orb into nine."

"What does that mean..."

"Just do as I say!"

I obediently divided the ghostly orb.

"Reincarnate the ghostly orb."

I think I know what he's trying to do. Maybe he's trying to help me ascend to the heavens. But it's a ridiculous idea.

'I haven't been able to use the Moon Dao Ascension for hundreds of years.'

"...The path of the sword you've walked is not mine."

When I thought I was Seoeunhyun, I thought I could use the Formless Sword with his memories. But now that I knew I was Seolip, I realized it wasn't my experience or enlightenment. So I couldn't use the Formless Sword. However, Seoeunhyun's next words were beyond my imagination.

"What have you been doing for the past 500 years?"

"What?"

"I asked what you've been doing for 500 years."

"...Didn't you see it through your mind?"

"Just answer."

"...I trained in the Great Desert Sea Star Technique, the Black Blood Flower, and the Six Extreme Thunder God Technique."

"Then you must know what you like the most."

"..."

"When you fought Tae Yeoljeon, you were connected to me. Do you remember what she used to ascend to the heavens?"

That's right. Tae Yeoljeon ascended to the heavens by sublimating her enlightenment from the Buddhist techniques she had mastered. But can I do it too? Can I really...

...

"Seoeunhyun, do you know?"

"What?"

I looked back at Seoeunhyun and smiled. He really felt annoyingly similar to Kim Younghoon. Why can't he just tell me?

"You're really... an annoying guy. Can't you just tell me?"

"It has meaning only if you figure it out yourself."

Seoeunhyun smiled back at my smile. He had been observing me from beyond the mind for 500 years. And he was the master of martial arts, the original owner of my talent. Seoeunhyun wasn't a madman who would suddenly force me to awaken. That means...

"You said it's already inside you. Wield it."

"Come to think of it, that's a line Younghoon hyung plagiarized."

The moment I realized it was already inside me, I believed in myself and moved forward.

'Ah...'

This is [me]. Abandoning all the training of the Ghost Dao Technique, abandoning the death that wasn't mine, and believing in what I had trained, I became complete as 'me' and obtained it. My own manifestation. The ghostly orbs reincarnated at my fingertips. The ghostly orbs drew a circle. Within the circle, I saw my own Three-Tai Chi. The Great Desert Sea Star Technique, the Black Blood Flower, the Six Extreme Thunder God Technique that I had trained.

'Moon Dao Ascension.'

A flower began to bloom at my fingertips.

"Falling Flower Difficult to Return to the Branch."

It wasn't the White Orchid Ascension Gate or the Black Blood Flower, but something black bloomed from my hand. My own ascension, created by melting the demonic techniques and curses with the enlightenment of martial arts in Seoeunhyun's memories. What had taken the form of the White Orchid Ascension Gate gradually changed into a different flower. A black lily. A single black lily bloomed, trembling and spreading in all directions. Black lily petals covered my surroundings.

Step.

I could take another step. The ascension that absorbed the pain and transformed it into pure energy, scattering it to the ground. Through the Falling Flower Difficult to Return to the Branch, I scattered the pain and sorrow filled in this darkness and moved forward. And I felt Seoeunhyun smiling behind me.

"Let's go."

He stood beside me, not behind me.

"Impressive."

Seoeunhyun drew a sword of light from the air.

"You said you reforged the Formless Sword. Can you hear its name now?"

Buzz—

I could hear it. The resonance of the Formless Sword in my ears, now that I had completely ascended.

"Your ascension seems to like plagiarism, just like its owner."

"Plagiarism? It's a name given to me as a gift."

I burst into laughter at Seoeunhyun's words.

Swish!

The black lily petals gathered, forming a flower sword in front of me. We took the same stance as when we first entered the sphere, each holding a flower sword and a Formless Sword.

'No, Seoeunhyun's sword is not the Formless Sword now.'

I spoke the name the Formless Sword had directly conveyed to me.

"The Total Heaven Sword is the final form of the Colorless Glass Sword."

"Since the Colorless Glass Sword was made to contain the Formless Sword, it's not strange for the Colorless Glass Sword's form to be named after the Formless Sword."

"Try creating a cool name like Younghoon hyung."

After exchanging some trivial words, we took our stances without anyone saying anything. Seoeunhyun's will resonated, and his ultimate technique was engraved in my mind.

The Mountain Severing Sword Technique. The Thirtieth Move. The Path After the Mountain Deepens.

—I will pierce through. Charge in.

Only after the mountain deepens does one find the path (山深然後道). For a moment, it felt like a faint forest scent was spreading. It felt like I had entered a deep mountain. Through Seoeunhyun's consciousness, I understood what the thirtieth move of the Mountain Severing Sword Technique was. In an instant, Seoeunhyun's Total Heaven Sword became completely transparent. It was a leap to an even deeper and higher level of the soul.

The basic of the sword is the downward slash. Raising the sword high and then slashing down. Using precise muscle movements to raise the sword high and then slash down, accelerating with the help of gravity to cut the opponent. It seems so simple, but in reality, it is a technique with tremendous power. And I could feel it. Seoeunhyun's Total Heaven Sword was leaping to an even higher level.

The sword moved. From a high level, it took the stance of a downward slash and fell. From a high position to a low position. From a high level to a low level. As the sword tip lowered, it gained acceleration, and as the level lowered, the training of the heavens and the earth was added to the sword. And finally, his sword completely descended to the level of matter.

Swish!

The last moment was too fast to follow with the eyes. It was just a moment, but it felt like his downward slash had surpassed the speed of light. And when his downward slash ended.

Slash!

I witnessed the darkness surrounding Kang Minhee, who had reached the level of a Celestial Human, split like a valley. A path to Kang Minhee opened. Without hesitation, I ran to her with the flower sword. Holding the sword made of black lily petals, I focused my mind. The center of the ghostly energy in the form of an eight-foot ghost. I saw her, completely blackened, crouching.

After entering the deep mountain and finding the path, one counts the spring before the flowers fall (山深然後道 花落以前春). Falling Flower Difficult to Return to the Branch. Application. Spring Before the Flowers Fall (花落以前春).

Clasp!

The flower sword made of black lily petals pierced Kang Minhee's body. At the same time, the flower sword began to shine and reverse to pure white. The white lily petals pushed away the darkness enveloping Kang Minhee. Originally, the Falling Flower Difficult to Return to the Branch absorbed pain and transformed it into energy, scattering it. The reversed Spring Before the Flowers Fall absorbed my power and conveyed emotions to the opponent. It seemed similar to the ultimate technique of the Moon Water Palace, but it was several levels higher!

Toward the immense sorrow enveloping Kang Minhee's body, I burned everything. My training. My life. My soul!

Crunch!

It felt like a pillar of light was entering Kang Minhee. I can reach her. I can reach her.

Rumble—

An immense repulsive force emanated from Kang Minhee. As if telling me not to approach. It was a formidable repulsive force. It felt like the space itself would be torn apart. But I couldn't lose.

'Please, please...!'

Even for just a moment, let me reach her! Seoeunhyun approached from behind and pushed my back. Together, we thrust the light into her. And the light exploded.

* * *

Swoosh—

It was raining. I looked around the ruins of Sapung Station. There was nothing left. Everything had been ground down by Kang Minhee's power, turning it into a desert like Satto Station. Originally, there were only valleys and mountain peaks, but now there was truly nothing left.

"...Are you satisfied, Seolip?"

I sat cross-legged and looked at Seolip lying beside me. No, saying he was lying was not accurate. Seolip's body had been completely torn apart and scattered somewhere, leaving only his head. He was barely clinging to life with the tenacious vitality of the original.

Seolip's attack, burning everything he had, was successful. I closed my eyes and recalled the situation from a moment ago. My Total Heaven Sword overlapped with Seolip's Falling Flower Difficult to Return to the Branch, creating an immense penetrating force for a moment. We barely managed to insert Seolip's Spring Before the Flowers Fall into her. Seolip's feelings were conveyed. But she had already reached the level of a Celestial Human. Kang Minhee was already a Ghost Dao Saintess. Kang Minhee opened her eyes. Blue tears flowed from her eyes, burning with blue ghostly fire. Kang Minhee. No, the Ghost Dao Saintess swung her arm at us. That was the end. The overwhelming difference in power crushed any will to resist. We were thrown out, and the Ghost Dao Saintess screamed a terrible ghostly wail and flew away somewhere.

'Kang Minhee...'

But I knew. Seolip's feelings were definitely conveyed. And for a very brief moment, she regained her sanity. Kang Minhee looked at me, called my name, and then lost her mind again and flew away.

"...Are you okay?"

She called my name at the last moment. In her mind, 'Seolip' did not exist. Kang Minhee always thought of Seolip as 'Seoeunhyun's clone.' In a way, Seolip's expectations were betrayed. But Seolip was smiling.

"...I'm... okay..."

"...What do you mean you're okay?"

Gulp! Suddenly, I felt a tightness in my chest and tried to breathe, but pieces of my internal organs came out with blood from my mouth. The once solid body of the earth was shattered. I could still feel the deathly energy permeating my body, preventing resurrection. Seolip must be feeling the same.

"Even if you reach the level of a Celestial Human, you die without a chance to resurrect."

I smiled bitterly and took a deep breath.

"Are you really okay, Seolip...?"

"...Seoeunhyun..."

Seolip, whose lungs were crushed, spoke with the remaining consciousness, vibrating the heavenly and earthly energy.

"I'm... really... okay..."

"...What do you mean you're okay..."

Sizzle—

The ghostly energy left by the Ghost Dao Saintess gradually invaded my body. It was the power of a Celestial Human. No matter what I did, I couldn't resist. The path to resurrection in the realm of the soul was distorted by the gravitational force, preventing our resurrection. But I used all my strength to stay upright in front of Seolip and listen to his last words. I would return. And Seolip would not. I instinctively felt from the depths of my soul that this was the end for him. He was a kind of subordinate born from me. But even
