Holding Hands (3)

“……”

I pondered with a cold gaze. Yan Wei, with her hands on her hips, looked at me questioningly and asked in a small voice, “There’s no time, Seo Eunhyun! Shouldn’t you use your specialty to remodel this fortress and create traps?”

Normally, I would take Yan Wei’s words as mere reference and act in the opposite direction. Her actions were mostly influenced by Yang Sujin’s behavior, and I was the complete opposite of Yang Sujin.

‘But honestly, Yuk Rin, that guy is untrustworthy.’

He was so blatantly plotting betrayal that I couldn’t just leave him be. After some contemplation, I quickly made a decision.

“There’s no need to turn the Zhenglong Palace into a trap.”

“What do you mean, Eunhyun?”

“There’s no need to create traps.”

“As expected of the leader!”

Yan Wei, who was about to voice her complaints, quickly changed her stance and cheered after hearing my words. I stood up and looked at Beixianghua, asking, “In the Conqueror King’s opinion, can the Conqueror King’s fleet subdue the Zhenglong Palace Lord?”

She pondered for a moment before replying, “If we had brought the entire fleet, it would be possible, but with only one-third of the fleet’s strength, it’s difficult.”

“Is that estimate including Kim Younghoon’s strength?”

“Yes, that’s correct. The fleet’s usual strength includes the power of Lingguang Shenmo Kim Younghoon.”

“I see. Then what if we add our sect’s combined technique master, Taesu Yukgeuk Gwiwang?”

Beixianghua glanced at Jeon Myunghoon and seemed to be calculating the total strength.

“In that case… it’s possible. However…”

“However?”

“To block the Zhenglong Palace Lord’s subordinates, we need someone skilled in fighting multiple opponents at once…”

I looked at Oh Hyunseok and Kim Yeon. Both were skilled in fighting multiple opponents.

‘It seems Kim Yeon is a bit uncomfortable with Beixianghua, so sending Oh Hyunseok might be…’

“I’ll go.”

“Hm?”

Unexpectedly, Kim Yeon volunteered.

“I’m a bit uneasy about sending this fool alone. As her older sister, it seems right for me to help.”

She looked at Beixianghua with an attitude of helping her clumsy younger sister, and Beixianghua let out a helpless laugh.

“Rather, I think I should be helping you. Honestly, our fleet’s strength surpasses yours.”

“Really? Then why were you taken hostage by me?”

The two glared at each other, their eyes blazing.

‘Just a few days ago, it seemed like they were getting along better…’

It seemed like they had reverted to their old ways.

‘Or maybe not.’

I read the emotions between the two and let out a wry smile.

“…Alright, then let’s have the volunteer, Kimyeo Gwiwang, support the Beixiang Fleet.”

As I snapped my fingers, the barriers across the entire Zhenglong Island were distorted by a force. An emergency was declared on Zhenglong Island.

“Yukgeuk Gwiwang Jeon Myunghoon, Kimyeo Gwiwang Kim Yeon, support the Conqueror King Beixianghua’s fleet and assist in the battle against Lingguang Shenmo to capture Zhenglong Palace Lord Yuk Rin.”

“Understood!”

Capturing the host as invited guests was quite a ridiculous task, but what could we do?

‘Now, even if I get backstabbed, it’s not just my problem.’

If I get deceived, the entire Wugek Sect gets deceived. Even with the ability to foresee others’ schemes, I couldn’t gamble with the sect’s safety. Risks had to be preemptively eliminated.

Rumble!

I raised my aura and commanded the ghostly creatures of the Guangyin Realm in their language. Eighteen heads sprouted from my shoulders, and my body turned black.

Woooooo!

Oooooo- Aaaaaaa-

Countless ghostly creatures began to cover Zhenglong Island with their wails.

* * *

Rumble!

Wei Yun, a half-human, half-fish yao tribe member living peacefully on Zhenglong Island, was returning home with clams she had gathered. Normally, she would have returned quickly, but today she had to take a detour. Today, important guests were visiting Zhenglong Island, and a notice had been issued that third-class citizens like her should not be seen by the guests.

Crack, crunch!

As she stepped on the ground, her body began to transform. The half-human, half-fish yao tribe had a unique trait: they could move comfortably on both land and water without using magic. Her lower body, which was in the form of a fish, transformed into human legs, while her upper body turned into a fish.

In her terrestrial form, Wei Yun hummed with her fish mouth as she carried the clams and took the long way home. Although it was a longer route than usual, it was peaceful because she didn’t have to pass through the main road where second-class citizens might harass her.

Wei Yun pondered what to eat with her family using the clams she had gathered today. Her village, a gathering place for third-class citizens known as the Abandoned Fish Village, was peaceful. Despite the severe discrimination against her half-fish tribe, the village was kind enough to call her family for help when needed and share leftover food.

She thought the Abandoned Fish Village was a wonderful place.

Screeeech!

Woooooo!

Oooooo-

Suddenly, dark clouds covered the entire Zhenglong Island, and terrifying ghosts began to fill the sky. Wei Yun, startled by the bizarre phenomenon, hurriedly ran towards her home. On Zhenglong Island, anyone below second-class citizens was forbidden from using flight techniques, so she couldn’t fly.

Finally, when Wei Yun reached her village, she saw it burning. Black ghosts and grotesque cursed dolls were setting the village on fire through ghostly transformations.

Screeeech!

Aaaah!

“Yun! Run away!”

“Don’t come here!”

Her parents shouted urgently as they saw her. Wei Yun dropped the clams she had gathered and stepped back. The ghosts, speaking in the incomprehensible language of the Minggui Realm, were capturing the yao tribe members of the Abandoned Fish Village, herding them somewhere, and setting buildings on fire while erecting something bizarre.

Wei Yun ran away. The grotesquely laughing ghosts and cursed dolls had completely overturned her peaceful life. She was so terrified that she could only run with her weak human legs.

And then, from the bushes, strange puppet soldiers appeared. The cursed dolls, with their heads spinning, screamed at Wei Yun in a bizarre language.

“Eeeek!”

Wei Yun screamed and ran again. The cursed dolls, shrieking in the dreadful language of the Minggui Realm, chased after her.

“Go away! Go… Ah!”

And then, she stumbled at the edge of Zhenglong Island. Wei Yun, with tears in her eyes, fell into the deep sea. She saw countless ships with flags written in the language of the Gaoli Realm.

The flags on the ships read:

‘Ah… I see. The demonic sect from another realm and the Conqueror King’s fleet…’

Wei Yun, with the culprits who ruined her life in her eyes, fell into the deep sea. The story of how the half-human, half-fish Wei Yun fell into the hidden deep sea below Zhenglong Island, gained a fortuitous encounter, and became a warrior burning with vengeance against the Wugek Sect is a tale for another time.

And leaving her behind, the Beixiang Fleet set out.

Rumble!

Beixianghua, the captain of the Beixiang Fleet, glanced uncomfortably at Kim Yeon beside her.

“Instead of playing around, why don’t you capture the Zhenglong Palace’s subordinates escaping from Zhenglong Island?”

“Oh, sorry, but it’s better to catch them when they come to help the palace lord. Right now, they’re scattered and running, but they’ll regroup when they come to help.”

“Ha! Instead of thinking about capturing one more quickly, you make such excuses. It’s a bit disgraceful.”

“I can’t hear the words of someone who clung to me and cried.”

Beixianghua’s face turned red.

“I-I never did that! And why are you in the captain’s cabin?”

“If you go fishing for carp and your memory turns into that of a carp, what should I do? I said I’m here to protect you because the palace lord’s subordinates might attack you like I did last time.”

“That was an exceptional case, and I said I don’t need protection! And it’s not fishing for carp, it’s fishing for crucian carp. Isn’t your intelligence more like a carp?”

Kim Yeon and Beixianghua glared at each other, grinding their teeth.

“Drive the fleet faster, you crybaby.”

“Who’s a crybaby! Don’t call me that!”

“Well, I wasn’t talking to you, but to the crybaby who clung to me and cried. Why are you feeling guilty? You said it wasn’t you?”

“Ugh…”

Beixianghua glared at Kim Yeon with a red face but eventually focused on commanding the fleet.

Rumble!

And then, after a while, Yuk Rin and Baek Rin, wearing crimson dragon robes, and Yuk Yo, who was being dragged by her hair by Yuk Rin, came into view.

* * *

Yuk Rin, with an expressionless face, turned around while holding Yuk Yo by her hair. Yuk Yo, covered in blood, couldn’t even maintain her flight and was hanging from Yuk Rin’s grip, while Baek Rin looked pale.

Yuk Rin, meeting the gaze of the Beixiang Fleet, asked, “Is the Conqueror King enjoying the banquet? Why have you come here with such excessive equipment for a stroll?”

In response, a man in black martial robes, Lingguang Shenmo Kim Younghoon, appeared on the bow of the Beixiang Fleet’s flagship and answered, “Haha, I apologize to the Zhenglong Palace Lord, but this Weizheng Sea has just been negotiated between the Wugek Sect and the Beixiang Fleet to be under our control.”

“Oh…”

However, Yuk Rin didn’t seem too surprised.

‘Well, I expected it when I saw that person’s face.’

He recalled the face of Yan Wei, the military strategist of the Wugek Sect. Although she didn’t recognize him, Yuk Rin knew her well.

About 40,000 years ago, when Yuk Rin had just reached the Tianren stage, a human from the Guanghan Realm had caused a great upheaval in the Gaoli Realm. The Betrayal King, Jin Wei!

‘After betraying the Heisei Ghost Palace, which taught her how to accumulate blessings in the Minggui Realm, she crossed over to the Gaoli Realm and continued to betray the forces that taught her about the Gaoli Realm’s situation, accumulating blessings through constant switching of sides. Eventually, she escaped using the power of her sect in the Guanghan Realm, and I heard she even betrayed her sect and fiancé.’

Although her fame had faded over 40,000 years, Yuk Rin clearly remembered her face and reputation.

‘The crazy human who betrayed my uncle’s Yinglong Palace forces, who helped her settle in the Gaoli Realm, and stole a million jade stones from Yinglong Palace.’

Yuk Rin’s uncle, Yinglong Palace Lord Yuk Woong, who had little time left to live, passed away in shock from the betrayal.

‘If the Conqueror King Beixianghua is famous for stabilizing the seas after conquering them, Jin Wei is infamous for causing chaos everywhere like a slippery eel. Starting with the incident where she captured the Doju of the Eel Tribe to obtain a tonic for her fiancé, to stealing the bear gall of the Doju of the Great Bear Tribe who sheltered her…’

The Gaoli Realm gave her the nickname Betrayal King for her countless deceptions, frauds, and betrayals.

Given her reputation, Yuk Rin expected the Wugek Sect to betray him. That’s why he prepared to betray them first.

‘But as expected, humans are true to their reputation. They’re trying to corner me before I can betray them. And as invited guests, no less!’

Yuk Rin’s eyes twitched as he asked Kim Younghoon, “I didn’t expect the Conqueror King’s forces, known for their honor and pride, to oppress me like this. Isn’t the Conqueror Fleet known for conquering only tyrannical lords?”

“That’s correct.”

Kim Younghoon nodded.

“Then have I committed such great tyranny in the Weizheng Sea?”

“No, you haven’t.”

“What? Then are you oppressing me without any reason?”

“There’s a misunderstanding. The Conqueror Fleet indeed opposes tyrannical lords. However, there’s another reason we oppose lords.”

Crackle!

Golden light began to emanate from Kim Younghoon’s body.

“Those who try to oppose us first are all unconditionally conquered. The reason we’ve conquered three seas as the Conqueror Fleet is not just because of tyranny but because they threatened us first. And the Zhenglong Palace Lord is no exception.”

After staring at Kim Younghoon for a while, Yuk Rin realized something.

“…I see. I’ve heard a lot about you, Lingguang Shenmo. They said you learned a unique technique to hide your aura, but that’s not it. You’re… the same type as the owner of the Salt Bone Ship!”

Salt Bone (鹽骨) Ship. It was the name of the main ship of the infamous pirate group in the Gaoli Realm, the Tuma Pirates, composed of the Tuma Tribe and several other ferocious tribes. The leader of the Tuma Pirates, Jinma Yeol, was the owner of the Salt Bone Ship, which was made entirely of precious salt.

Yuk Rin caressed his bracelet.

“Can you read my mind even now? I’ve maximized the performance of my artifact.”

Kim Younghoon silently drew his sword. Yuk Rin clicked his tongue.

“So you can see. You seem to be superior to Jinma Yeol. Was it called Tupo that he practiced…?”

However, Kim Younghoon frowned in displeasure.

“What he practices and what I practice are completely different. He practices Tupo, and I practice what is called Wugong (武功).”

“Are they different?”

“Of course. After all…”

Kim Younghoon, with an annoyed expression, lowered his sword.

“He is not a warrior (武人).”

“…? Of course, he’s not. He’s a Tuma.”

“…Forget it. You wouldn’t understand anyway… Just surrender quietly.”

“Hah…”

Yuk Rin smirked and began to cover his entire body with his domain.

Rumble!

Yuk Rin’s body swelled as he enveloped himself in a massive crimson dragon. Although he seemed excited, his mind was cold.

‘I’ve covered my body with my domain and maximized the activation of my artifact. No matter how much he practices Tupo, it will be harder to read my emotions.’

As he expected, Kim Younghoon stopped reading his thoughts and began to gather his energy. Yuk Rin, appearing excited, clicked his tongue coldly.

‘Lingguang Shenmo Kim Younghoon. The Conqueror King’s Beixiang Fleet. And… the combined technique master who overwhelmed Jinma Yeol, and the suspicious human woman. I will lose.’

He threw Yuk Yo aside and breathed out light. Kim Younghoon’s golden sword cut through Yuk Rin’s breath. As Kim Younghoon and Jeon Myunghoon flew towards him, Yuk Rin thought.

‘It doesn’t matter. I’ll let them win today. If I can infiltrate their inner circle like this… I can enter Penglai Island and ultimately be the final victor…!’

* * *

“Sign it, Yuk Rin.”

The Beixiang Fleet captured Yuk Rin and presented him with the contract. The original terms of the contract had been completely revised by Yan Wei. As a result, Yuk Rin, who was supposed to be an ally, was now reduced to a near-slave status. In front of everyone, he signed the contract, becoming a quasi-slave of the Wugek Sect under the name of the Gaoli Realm’s Saint Hae Rin.

I questioned Yuk Rin.

“Yuk Rin. You consistently hid something from us and tried to betray us. As the sect leader, I can read minds. What were you hiding from us?”

“Haha, impressive. Are you using some kind of mind-reading technique?”

“…It’s similar, though the term is a bit off.”

He let out a low chuckle and told us the truth.

“…I intended to betray the Wugek Sect and you.”

“Why?”

But before I could pursue the reason, Yan Wei shouted beside me, “Sect Leader! There’s no need to listen to the reasons. The Gaoli Realm’s yao tribe is known for betrayal, fraud, and deceit. It’s in their nature, so the reason is meaningless. What’s more important is ‘how’ he intended to betray us!”

‘Did she suffer a lot in the Gaoli Realm before?’

Following the advice of the experienced Yan Wei, I changed my question.

“You proposed a contract with the Xian Contract, so how did you plan to betray us?”

Yuk Rin smirked and answered.

“When we enter Penglai Island, the power of the Xian Contract will almost disappear. In the inner barriers, countless oaths and contracts lose their effect.”

“So you planned to betray us using the characteristics of Penglai Island.”

“That’s correct.”

“Then…”

I continued to interrogate Yuk Rin, who had signed the slave contract.

* * *

The half-fish girl, Wei Yun, stirred and opened her eyes.

“W-Where am I…?”

It was a dark place.

“Didn’t I jump into the deep sea?”

She looked around at the surroundings filled with real water, unlike the dimensional deep sea. The area was filled with salty water. Transforming her lower body into a fish’s, Wei Yun swam around. She soon realized she had fallen into a lake-like place and swam to the edge of the lake.

“What is this…?”

At the edge of the lake, she saw a giant statue of a sea dragon.
