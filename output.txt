In front of the magic school, a genius who disappeared in an instant became 140 34. Summer vacation (4) Second Tower, Ih Han-wol's office. "A trip......" Instructor Ih Han-wol looked at the children who came with travel applications with a strange look in his eyes. Hong Bi-yeon Princess, Aijel Duchess, and Pulleim. Three girls who don't really match each other decided to go on a sudden trip. Who wouldn't be curious? "Not allowed?" "It's not that, but..." There's really no reason to refuse. It's summer vacation after all. "It's for a week. Where are you planning to go?" "To the Diamond Coast of La Plat Island. It's famous as a resort." "Ah, I see. But... isn't it more famous as a hunting ground there? You're not planning to pretend to be adults, are you?" Flinch. Pulleim trembled at Ih Han-wol's words. She just randomly blurted out the name of a famous resort she heard in the original novel, but she never expected such a background. "Ehehe... of course not." "Well, with your faces being so famous, even if you wanted to hunt, pretending to be adults, you'd be caught in no time. Don't get into any unnecessary trouble." "Surfing and suntan! And drinking wine under the warm sun... I mean grape juice! We'll do everything we can at the beach and come back!" Stamp! Ih Han-wol stamped the seal, and the girls rushed out of the office. "Phew. I didn't expect La Plat Island to be a meeting place for men and women." "How could they know we're teenagers......" "Surprisingly many." Hong Bi-yeon replied. When Pulleim and Aijel stared at her, she chuckled and replied after a fake cough. "Some from my faction even went to the beach pretending to be adults to flirt." "Wow.... There are really people like that." "Kids these days are getting bolder." "Miss Pulleim, you speak as if you were an adult?" "I'm mentally mature." "Ah... I see... I understand." When unnecessary chatter started, Hong Bi-yeon cut it off. "Enough chit-chat, are we leaving right away?" "Yes. That's right. There's no reason to delay." "Then let's each pack our things and meet at Gate 4 Warp Hole." With those words, Hong Bi-yeon coolly disappeared. Watching her leave, Aijel looked towards the direction where cheers could be heard. Stella Dome. By now... they would probably be taking exams to select participants for the school tournament. "Why? Disappointed?" When Pulleim asked with a subtle expression, Aijel shook her head sadly. "I was looking forward to it, but there are priorities in life. I can participate next year as well." "That's true. But if we come back as planned, we might be able to watch the final match, right? I wonder who will represent our school?" "Hmm... The school tournament is mainly an event to showcase one's magical abilities to the world, so Aijel had been looking forward to it. However, now it didn't matter much. Having successfully spread magic under the name of 'Morph' through the Aslan Seminar, there was no need for her to aim for the school tournament. Even if that wasn't the case, comparing it to the 'Constellatio Project' or any other event would be absurd. "Anyway, to enjoy watching the final match when we come back, we need to successfully finish this task, right?" "Of course." Aijel nodded firmly, and Pulleim patted her on the back like an affectionate older sister. "Well, let's go then." Their journey seemed smooth, but it was not easy. It was quite chaotic due to their fame. La Plat Airport. "Wow... there's Princess Hong Bi-yeon." "Seems like she's on vacation...." "I thought she was a model." Hong Bi-yeon, wearing a simple white dress, had one hand on her silver travel suitcase and the other hand on her hip. Behind her black sunglasses, she seemed to be looking into the distance as if saying, 'Take a picture.' Perhaps understanding that telepathy, the reporters following Hong Bi-yeon were capturing her from various angles. Of course, she was enjoying the attention as well. Every move she made attracted people, turning her outfit into a trend among teenage girls in an instant. "Phew... it's so hot." Some people didn't care at all. Pulleim was wearing blue hot pants, a blue cap, and a white tank top. It was an ordinary fashion, but she pulled it off perfectly, proving her fashion sense. In contrast, Aijel was quite conscious of the gazes around her, fiddling with her hair. 'I should have dressed up a bit too... Wearing sky blue pants and a sky blue t-shirt, she felt envious of Hong Bi-yeon and Pulleim's sense of style, but she pretended not to care. She didn't pay much attention to the stares anymore. It was quite burdensome, but Aijel, who had lived with malicious glares, didn't mind the attention. Later, the three girls boarded the plane and each opened a book without exchanging a word. Hong Bi-yeon was reading a famous people magazine, Pulleim was reading the June issue of the Monthly Trend, and Aijel was reading a philosophical book objectively summarizing the impact of magic development from ancient civilizations on human power and the flow of history. 'It's comfortable...' Thanks to Hong Bi-yeon's VIP status, all three could board the business class seats, but for Aijel, it was her first time, so everything felt unfamiliar. Except for a flight attendant who mistook her for an adult and tried to serve wine, she had nothing to worry about. 'Is this the power of money and authority...?' Pulleim, who was reading a magazine, had fallen asleep, and Hong Bi-yeon was elegantly gazing out the window even in this boredom. Feeling no one else was feeling burdened except herself, Aijel tried to relax in her seat. Her body was comfortable, but her mind was not at ease. She was unaware of this fact. They flew in silence for a while. "Aijel." Suddenly, Hong Bi-yeon called out. Even though she called her name, it felt so natural that Aijel didn't realize it at first. "Ah... yes?" "After saving the commoner, what do you plan to do?" "...What do you mean?" Hong Bi-yeon, who had been looking out the window, turned to Aijel with her blue eyes. "There must be a reason why you're so obsessed with that commoner's life. What is that reason?" "That's... before Aijel could answer, Hong Bi-yeon cut in decisively as if she had expected it. "I'm going to make that commoner... into my person." "...What?" It was such a sudden declaration that Aijel couldn't fully grasp it and widened her eyes. "Literally. I will make the commoner my own. To do that... I won't hesitate to use any means necessary." The 'means and methods' she mentioned included a lot, and Aijel could understand that. "I appreciate your efforts to save the commoner's life. But me moving with you, this is the last time. If you interfere with my goals... I have no hesitation in completely excluding you." Aijel's eyes trembled at her words. What should she say in response? It was a kind of declaration of war. 'I will have this item, so don't touch it and get lost.' But why... is she saying this to me? There's Pulleim right next to me. She thought that way in her head, but in her heart, she was accepting it. Why would she do that? It's obvious. "...Is that so." Aijel raised her head again and stared at Hong Bi-yeon's red eyes. "Effort is freedom." With that, Hong Bi-yeon chuckled and looked out the window again. It was an attitude that said it didn't matter what Aijel did, so Aijel felt a surge of anger for a moment, but she suppressed it, knowing that it was just the way she expressed herself. 'This girl, just watch.' * * * A quiet cafe in Arkaneum. The low price of $5,000 for a cup of coffee was enough to captivate the hearts of the few commoners, and the same was true for Baek Yuseol. As some people knew, Baek Yuseol was already wealthy. Filthy rich, in fact. So many people wondered why he always headed to this cafe, but... there was really no reason. 'Too lazy to go far.' To quit the gym, it was advised to choose a nearby place as the first goal rather than a perfect exercise facility and a great trainer. That way, you would be more likely to go to the gym. Of course, Baek Yuseol wasn't coming to the cafe to train, but recently, he couldn't really enjoy his leisure time properly. In this world, there were no televisions or computers, but instead, there was the 'Magic Screen,' where newspapers and news were quickly uploaded, spreading issues rapidly. Recently, due to his considerable fame, the warm gazes of reporters lurking in the cafe were burdensome. Some students were blatantly staring at him, and it was clear they had come to see him. 'Are they exchange students?' Still, it was fortunate that no one came up to talk to him directly. "Hey... as soon as he thought that, someone approached. Raising his head to check, a cute girl with her hair split into two ponytails stood fidgeting in front of him. "Why don't you give me a love letter or something?" "Oh, no! Th-that's not it..." "Hmm..." An unfamiliar school uniform. An unfamiliar face. Her name was Anella... as expected, he had never heard of her before. He wanted to take out his glasses, but before that, Anella handed him something. "Um, could you... sign this for me...?" "...Sign?" It was the first time he had heard such a ridiculous request, but he felt he could do it. After all, he was famous. 'Come to think of it, wasn't there something similar in the original game...?' Users who unlocked a specific route and could play the 'Character Makeover' occasionally participated in a ridiculous event called a 'signing event,' where additional abilities such as temperament and charm would increase, allowing players to beautify their characters. But he had never expected to receive it like this. "Sure." It didn't cost anything, and since she came to me saying she liked it, there was no reason to refuse. Baek Yuseol casually took the paper and opened the pen cap. Suddenly, before he could sign, Anella grabbed Baek Yuseol's shoulders and brought her face close to his. "What are you doing...?" "Look into my eyes." "What?" Slowly... something was swirling in Anella's black eyes. As Baek Yuseol's pupils, which had been staring blankly at it, began to dilate, Anella smiled with satisfaction. 'Good, it worked!' Anella's best attribute, [Nightmare's Rebirth]. A rare mental attack that delves deep into the target's mind, triggering their deepest trauma... one of the few mental attacks in the world. Thump! Anella, who had fallen into the sea of Baek Yuseol's name, looked around with a refreshing expression. This was her mental world. Although she couldn't read the minds of others, Anella, who had inherited some characteristics of the extinct 'Dreamer Tribe,' could delve into the most painful past of the target by turning it into a dream. She couldn't choose the dream she wanted to see, and the only thing that unfolded before her eyes was the most painful memory. The disadvantage was that if the caster couldn't bear it, the victim and the caster could collapse mentally at that moment. But that was not a concern for Anella. For her, who had lived through all sorts of terrible things, witnessing various pains and traumas was just like watching a slightly sad tragedy. 'Now... where should I poke at the most painful spot?' After investigating, Baek Yuseol's past was likely filled with quite painful memories. 'When were you most desperate?' When you lost your hometown? When you lost your parents? When you lost your best friend? 'I'll think about it, since you're asking.' Anella thought so and raised her arms towards the sea. Whoosh! At that moment, a sharp thorn pierced through Anella's chest. 'Crack...?' Trembling hands looked at the thorn stuck in her chest. Her heart wasn't beating. Bright red fresh blood was flowing out. 'Death.' Baek Yuseol's most painful past was... death. And not just any death, but his own death. 'How...?! How can death be the most painful past?' 'I never... thought that way, but this time, a huge gravestone fell from the sky and crushed Anella's body. 'Crack....' Before she could even scream, she was crushed. -Kraaah!! However, before she could shake off the pain, a monster flew in from somewhere and tore her body apart, a huge flame pierced through her body, sharp spears pierced her all over, and she was shattered into pieces by various magical attacks. 'Save me... As she slowly, slowly crumbled under the pouring 'death,' she gradually, slowly... fell apart.
